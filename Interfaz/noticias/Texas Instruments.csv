0;TXN;Texas Instruments;2019-10-22T21:15:50Z;Texas Instruments sales outlook spooks chip investors;;Texas Instruments offered a sales outlook that came up short against Wall Street estimates, driving down shares in the company and fellow chipmakers late Tuesday.The Dallas-based group was one of the first chipmakers to warn last year of softer demand in the sector, amid weaker economic growth globally and US-China trade tensions. Texas Instruments and the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tracks 30 players in the industry, have both outperformed the broader market this year on hopes of improving trends.But Texas Instruments’ outlook for revenue in the fourth quarter, at $3.07bn to $3.33bn, was softer than the $3.59bn analysts expected. Revenue from the third quarter also fell shy of estimates.Shares in Texas Instruments fell nearly 9 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday. Other US chipmakers including Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia also saw their shares drop in sympathy. Nvidia fared the worst among the trio, with shares sliding 2.9 per cent.Texas Instruments is seen as a bellwether for semiconductor companies each quarter. The company makes a wide range of chips used in everything from calculators to cars and communications equipment.It booked revenue that fell about 11 per cent year-over-year to $3.77bn in the period ending in September, as “most markets weakened further”, chief executive Rich Templeton said. Analysts on average had forecast $3.82bn in revenue.Earnings per share of $1.49 beat expectations for $1.42.
1;TXN;Texas Instruments;2019-04-23T21:19:20Z;Soft chip demand weighs on Texas Instruments outlook;;Texas Instruments booked stronger earnings than expected in the first quarter, even as softer demand weighed on the chipmaker’s sales.The Dallas-based company has the largest number of customers in the semiconductor industry and makes a wide range of chips used in calculators, cars, communications equipment and industrial applications. Texas Instruments was one of the first chipmakers to warn last year of softer demand, but it eased those fears in January with a first-quarter forecast that cheered investors.Texas Instruments reported net income of $1.22bn, down 11 per cent from $1.37bn in the same period a year earlier. On a per-share basis, the company earned $1.26, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.13. Earnings per share included a four-cent discrete tax benefit that was not included in the company’s previous guidance.Revenue was down 5 per cent at $3.59bn but also beat expectations, with analysts looking for $3.48bn.However, the company provided an outlook that mostly fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts after warning that demand for its products “continued to slow across most markets” in the last period. It projected earnings per share of $1.12 to $1.32 on revenue of $3.46bn to $3.74bn for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $1.24 per share and $3.66bn.In the March quarter, sales in Texas Instruments’ analogue segment remained more resilient than embedded processing, which didn’t benefit from growing 5G technology, executives noted during an earnings call. They also said weakness in the quarter was seen across its portfolio with the exception of chips made for communications equipment, a business that grew about 30 per cent year-over-year.Shares of Texas Instruments initially spiked more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading but later shed those gains, slipping 2.4 per cent.
2;TXN;Texas Instruments;2019-01-23T22:23:33Z;Chipmaker Texas Instruments posts revenue drop on slower demand;;Chipmaker Texas Instruments on Wednesday said revenues fell in the fourth quarter as demand for its products slowed across most markets and delivered a soft outlook for the current quarter.The Dallas-based company said revenue fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $3.72bn, just shy of analysts’ estimates for $3.74bn, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.The company noted its sales decreased “as demand for our products continued to slow across most markets”. Revenue for its analogue products grew 4 per cent but declined 12 per cent in its embedded processing business.Texas Instruments said on its earnings call that demand in China was weaker than in other regions and added that its customers signalled “this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions”.Net income more than tripled to $1.24bn from $344m in the year-ago quarter as the company noted sharply lower provisions for income taxes. That translated to earnings of $1.27 a share, compared with 34 cents a share in the year-ago quarter and topped analysts’ estimates for $1.24 a share.Texas Instruments makes chips for products ranging from small personal gadgets like calculators to high-end industrial equipment and has more recently benefited from a move by automakers into self-driving technology. However, in October the company became among the first in the sector to warn of a slowdown in its so-called end markets, driven by a deceleration in semiconductors.The company also endured a flux in leadership last year after its chief executive Brian Crutcher abruptly resigned less than seven weeks into his job last summer owing to “violations” of the company’s code of conduct.For the current quarter, the company forecast revenue between $3.34bn to $3.63bn, with the low-end of that projection below analysts’ estimates for $3.59bn.It also provided a soft earnings guidance of between $1.03 a share to $1.21 a share, which includes a roughly $20m discrete tax benefit. That compared to analysts’ expectations for $1.20.Texas Instruments shares, which are up 1 per cent year-to-date, having declined 9 per cent last year, rose nearly 2 per cent in after-hours trade.
3;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-07-24T22:03:27Z;Texas Instruments’ quarterly outlook tops view;;Chipmaker Texas Instruments whose chief executive abruptly resigned last week delivered upbeat outlook for the current quarter amid strong demand for its products in automotive and industrial markets.Shares in the Dallas-based company were up just 0.3 per cent in extended trade on Tuesday after it said it expects current quarter earnings of between $1.41 to $1.63 a share on revenues of between $4.11bn to $4.45bn. That compares with analyst expectations for earnings of $1.48 a share, on revenue of $4.27bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.The strong outlook accompanied second-quarter revenue that climbed 9 per cent from a year ago to $4.02bn — just ahead of analyst expectations for $3.97bn — driven by demand for its so-called analogue and embedded processing products in the industrial and automotive markets. Texas Instruments makes chips for products ranging from small personal gadgets like calculators to high-end industrial equipment and has more recently has benefited from a move by automakers into self-driving technology.The company also said its net income rose to $1.4bn or $1.40 a share, compared with $1.06bn or $1.03 a share in the year ago period. That handily topped estimates of $1.32 a share.Rich Templeton, who resumed the role of chief executive last week, presided over the results. Brian Crutcher stepped down from the top job after less than seven weeks at the helm owing to “violations” of the company’s code of conduct that were “related to personal behaviour” but not related to operations or financial reporting.Texas Instruments shares are up nearly 9 per cent year-to-date.
4;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-07-20T15:30:56Z;Where did all the chief executives go (and so quietly)?;Blankfein’s stage-managed exit from Goldman appears to be the exception to a trend;"As Lloyd Blankfein began a long farewell from Goldman Sachs this week with praise from Wall Street luminaries ringing in his ears, the chief executive of a larger company slipped out the back door.In a curt statement, Texas Instruments announced the departure of Brian Crutcher, who had been in the job for less than two months: “Crutcher resigned due to violations of the company’s code of conduct. The violations are related to personal behaviour that is not consistent with our ethics and core values, but not related to company strategy, operations or financial reporting.”Chief executives are vanishing from public companies at an alarming rate, often in mysterious circumstances. This month Barnes & Noble’s chief executive, Demos Parneros, was fired “for violations of the company’s policies”. It was “not due to any disagreement with the company regarding its financial reporting, policies or practices or any potential fraud relating thereto”.In April, WPP announced that Martin Sorrell had “stepped down”, providing only this context: “The previously announced investigation into an allegation of misconduct against Sir Martin has concluded. The allegation did not involve amounts that are material.”If it goes on like this, stage-managed departures such as that of Mr Blankfein will be the exception. The rule will be vaguely worded statements and a quick trip out of the building — don’t stop for cake.There is a question about whether this lack of information is fair to shareholders, or other employees. Boards should ponder a few things before opting for the legal boilerplate.Mr Crutcher was hardly a household name; Texas Instruments itself gets relatively little attention. Perhaps his exit will remain a mystery. Sir Martin, on the other hand — larger than life, the personification of the advertising group he built — was unlikely to slip away without anyone finding out why.When Brian Krzanich left Intel last month, the chipmaker disclosed that he had a “past consensual relationship with an Intel employee”, which was a “violation of Intel’s non-fraternisation policy”. Boeing’s Harry Stonecipher and Priceline’s Darren Huston left in similar circumstances. Nobody is left wondering about darker explanations. Hewlett-Packard offered some details when chief executive Mark Hurd left in 2010, but investors were deprived of the full set of reasons and were left angry at the board.When Vikram Pandit was ousted from Citigroup in 2012, both he and the company maintained that he had left of his own volition. However, Mr Pandit’s lieutenant, John Havens, would not stick to the script. “He’s going around screaming that ‘we were f**king fired’,” a colleague told the Financial Times shortly afterwards*.When Pimco’s chief executive Mohamed El-Erian left in 2014, parent company Allianz offered only that he “has resigned”. As the FT first reported, though, his exit came after stormy clashes with chief investment officer Bill Gross, who ended up leaving too.If your company or your chief executive is important enough, the scandal bad enough, or the anger bitter enough, skimpy disclosure is not going to achieve anything.*Mr Havens subsequently rejected the attributed quotes and the characterisation of his departure."
5;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-07-17T21:40:41Z;Texas Instruments CEO resigns after code of conduct violations;;Texas Instruments announced the resignation of its chief executive, Brian Crutcher, after fewer than seven weeks in the job, owing to “violations” of the company’s code of conduct.Rich Templeton, who Mr Crutcher replaced on June 1, will reassume his role as CEO on an “ongoing, indefinite basis”, the company said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, and would also continue in his role as chairman.The semiconductor maker said in the same statement that Mr Crutcher had resigned “due to violations of the company’s code of conduct” and that these violations “are related to personal behaviour that is not consistent with our ethics and core values, but not related to company strategy, operations or financial reporting.”In an email to the Financial Times, TI said the “board was made aware of these allegations last week, and they immediately looked into them”, adding that Mr Crutcher submitted his resignation today.Mr Crutcher was a 22-year veteran of TI and, before his brief elevation to chief executive, had been chief operating officer since 2017. He could not be reached immediately for comment.In a January statement, when the appointment was announced, Mr Templeton then described his successor as “exceptional leader who inspires others and delivers great results”. Wayne Sanders, lead director of TI’s board and chairman of the governance and stockholder relations committee said in the same statement: “The directors have had a number of years to assess Brian’s ability, results and style, and we are highly confident he is TI’s next great leader.”TI shares were 1.8 per cent lower in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq after news of his departure.Mr Crutcher is the second leader of a major technology company to resign over conduct issues in a matter of weeks. In June, Brian Krzanich, quit as Intel CEO following a past relationship with an employee that the chipmaker said had violated its non-fraternisation policy.
6;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Texas Instruments powers higher as sales, profit jump;;US chipmaker Texas Instruments posted solid double-digit growth in both sales and profit in the first three months of 2018, citing strong demand for its products in the industrial and automotive markets.The Dallas-based company’s strong earnings report helped juice its shares, which rose 4.9 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. For the three months ending March 31, revenue rose 11 per cent year-on-year to $3.79bn.TI credited the increase in part to continued strength in demand for its analogue and embedded processing products in the industrial and automotive sector.Net income came in 37 per cent higher year-on-year to $1.37bn, or $1.35 a share, including a 14 cent boost from tax-related benefits.Analysts had been looking for net income of $1.1bn, or $1.10 a share, on sales of $3.6bn, according to Thomson Reuters.TI said it is eyeing revenue between $3.78bn and $4.1bn in the current quarter, with earnings per share expected to clock in between $1.19 and $1.39. The top end of that range is above the $3.89bn in revenue and $1.23 in earnings per share that analysts had pencilled in.The solid earnings will probably come as a relief to the semiconductor sector, which has been buffeted in recent weeks by concerns about whether its red-hot growth can continue if smartphone demand drops off, reducing the appetite for their products. Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor, one of Apple’s biggest suppliers, warned of “weak demand from the mobile sector”.But TI’s wide range of chips — used in everything from personal electronics to industrial equipment — could help insulate it from some of those pressures, particularly with its foothold in the automotive sector, as more carmakers race to advance driving technology.TI shares surged 43 per cent in 2017 but have fallen 5.7 per cent so far in 2018.
7;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-01-29T11:56:05Z;Semiconductors: short circuit;Signs of trouble as the chip sector reaches new heights  ;"The chips are up. The main US semiconductor index has been hitting new all-time highs. Investors cheered Intel’s earnings last week. In Europe, shares in Switzerland-listed AMS shot up by a quarter on Monday after a big increase in its forecast sales growth rate. Behind the exuberance, though, not all is well in semiconductor land.Chip stocks have taken a surprisingly long time to return to their dotcom bubble heights, as they were unusually hyped back then. Ascending to the previous peak required the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (Sox) to rise 120 per cent in the past two years compared with a 51 per cent rise in the S&P 500.Challenges are multiplying faster than positives. Texas Instruments shares fell 9 per cent last week following a disappointing earnings forecast. Intel’s own forecast was trimmed on weaker gross margins.AMS’s fourth-quarter sales reassured markets about iPhone X demand, but said little about the broader outlook. Its shares are still below their November peak and AMS is not, in any event, a Sox constituentEven if Sox members have more earnings to support their shares than in 2000, there are still reasons to worry. First, the wider sector is in the grip of M&A hype. That includes what would be the biggest tech deal ever mooted — the $130bn acquisition of Qualcomm by Broadcom. Bankers are also betting on smaller companies to consolidate, pointing to the likes of Xilinx, with a $17bn enterprise value. The deal fever could abate just as quickly.Second, many of the biggest gainers have been puffed up to worrisome multiples, propelled by chips that are, or might be, part of the next big thing: bitcoin, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and virtual reality. That drove the 300 per cent increase in shares in Nvidia in the past two years. Its $140bn enterprise value is supported by just $3bn of earnings before standard deductions. Finally, even companies with neither takeover speculation nor exposure to the frothier end users have been carried along in the euphoria. Texas Instruments has a reputation for discipline with cash. Its share price decline followed a forecast of 7 per cent year-on-year growth for the first quarter, disappointing to investors who had hoped for double-digit growth to continue. The Sox is now off its latest high; it might not take 18 years to print another, but a proper correction looks overdue.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

8;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
9;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-01-23T21:31:06Z;Texas Instruments profit slumps after tax subtraction;;Texas Instruments’ quarterly earnings dropped 67 per cent due to unexpected tax expenses on the heels of the latest legislative overhaul, sending the US-based chipmaker’s shares lower in after-hours trading.TI said that sales for the three-month period ending December 31 were up 10 per cent year-on-year to $3.7bn, in line with analysts’ estimates. Rich Templeton — the company’s longtime chief executive and chairman who recently announced his impending departure — credited the boost to continued strong demand in the industrial and automotive businesses.But net income fell to $344m and earnings per share came in at just 34 cents, with both figures clocking respective 67 per cent year-on-year declines thanks to expenses “primarily due to the recently passed tax reform act”, TI said. Analysts surveyed by Factset had been looking for earning per share of $1.09 on $1.09bn in net income.Despite the short-term hit, TI expects to reap benefits from Republicans’ tax overhaul in the long term, with its annual operating tax rate expected to fall from 31 per cent in 2017 to 23 per cent in 2018 and an ongoing rate of 18 per cent beginning in 2019.For the current quarter, it said it is looking for revenue between $3.49bn and $3.79bn, and earnings per share of $1.01 and $1.17, generally in line with what analysts surveyed by Factset are expecting.Last week, Texas Instruments — which makes chips for use in products ranging from small personal gadgets like calculators to high-end industrial equipment — said that Mr Templeton will leave the top job in June. He will be replaced by Brian Crutcher, TI’s current chief operating officer.TI shares, which rose 43.1 per cent in 2017, dropped 5.3 per cent in after-hours trading.
10;TXN;Texas Instruments;2018-01-18T21:56:01Z;Texas Instruments names a new chief;Rich Templeton will remain the US semiconductor company’s chairman;"Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor maker, has tapped a new chief executive to replace Rich Templeton, who will step down in June after almost 14 years in the top job.His successor will be Brian Crutcher, the company’s current chief operating officer and 22-year veteran of the Dallas-based company, which makes chips for use in products ranging from small personal gadgets to high-end industrial equipment. Mr Templeton will retain his role as chairman of TI’s board of directors.Mr Templeton will hand over the reins effective June 1, the company announced on Thursday.Mr Crutcher said in a statement:‘”This is an exciting time to lead TI. I am honored to succeed Rich, whose leadership and vision have made our company stronger today than ever, and provides a solid foundation to build upon. Our semiconductors are inside tens of thousands of different types of electronics. We have the right products, analog and embedded; are focused on the right markets, industrial and automotive; and remain committed to helping our customers find new ways to solve problems. I am energized by the opportunities we have ahead of us and look forward to working with TIers around the world to continue making TI a better supplier, employer and investment.”Since 2004 – the year in which Mr Templeton was named chief executive – the company’s shares have risen about 370 per cent in value, according to Thomson Reuters data, including a 43.1 per cent gain last year."
11;TXN;Texas Instruments;2017-09-21T21:07:29Z;Texas Instruments boosts share buybacks, dividend;;Texas Instruments is injecting more cash into share repurchases and raising its dividend.The US-based chipmaker said after the market closed on Thursday that it was authorising an additional $6bn in share repurchases “over time”. That comes on top of approximately $4.6bn that remained as of the end of June under a previously authorised repurchase programme.The company — which makes chips used in everything from personal electronics and industrial equipment — will also boost its quarterly cash dividend by 24 per cent, from 50 cents to 62 cents a share, or $2.48 on an annual basis. It will be payable November 13 to shareholders of record as of October 31, subject to a formal declaration by its board at a meeting in October.Texas Instruments said in a statement:“Dividend increases and share repurchases are both part of TI’s capital management strategy and reflect the company’s strong free cash flow generation and commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. With today’s announcement, the company has increased dividends each of the past 14 years, and through consistent share repurchases has reduced outstanding shares by 42 per cent since the end of 2004.”Texas Instruments shares were up 1 per cent in after-hours trading.
12;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Texas Instruments shares rise as automotive, industrial demand boosts sales;;Texas Instruments shares climbed in extended trading after the semiconductor maker posted upbeat second quarter results and gave a rosy outlook for the current quarter.The Dallas-based company, which makes chips used in everything from personal electronics like mobile phones to industrial end equipment used in space, avionics and defense, saw its shares rise nearly 3 per cent in extended trading to $83.69. The gains came after TI said profits grew to $1.06bn, or $1.03 a share, in the three months ended in June, compared with $819m, or 79 cents a share, in the year ago period. That eclipsed Wall Street expectations for earnings of 95 cents a share.Revenue grew 13 per cent from a year ago to $3.69bn, topping analysts’ estimates of $3.56bn as “demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market”.Sales of its analog devices, which convert digital signals into electric ones, and account for the largest part of TI’s revenue pie, rose 18 per cent from a year ago to $2.4bn.Looking ahead, the company forecast revenue in the range of $3.74bn to $4.06bn in the current quarter, with the high end easily besting Wall Street projections of $3.8bn.The company’s shares are up 11 per cent this year as increasing appetite for smart products has lifted demand for semiconductors.
13;TXN;Texas Instruments;2017-07-24T17:01:20Z;Nasdaq sets fresh record high ahead of tech earnings;;The Nasdaq Composite on Monday set a fresh record high, with investors taking a bullish tone ahead of earnings reports from several big tech groups that are due in coming days.The gauge climbed as much as 0.17 per cent to 6,398.57, hitting a new peak in a feat not achieved since last Thursday. The broader markets were in the red, with the S&P 500 down 0.11 per cent to 2,469.8.Monday’s gains come ahead of earnings slated for later in the day from Google parent Alphabet. Facebook, Intel and Texas Instruments are on the docket later this week. Amazon, another big Nasdaq stock, also reports this week.Traders have bid-up tech shares this year, partially on expectations they will continue posting brisk earnings growth even as the broader economy expands at a sluggish pace. Overall, profits of S&P 500 tech companies are expected to have risen around 11 per cent in the second quarter, according to FactSet.
14;TXN;Texas Instruments;2017-02-22T13:08:09Z;Semiconductors: the joy of Sox;The surge in chip stocks can be justified only by technological revolution;"This is bigger than a normal boom in the notoriously cyclical chip industry. In the past 12 months, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (Sox), which tracks the fortunes of the sector’s 30 biggest companies, is up 64 per cent compared with a 23 per cent rise in the S&P 500.Investors, unlike Public Enemy, do believe the hype. They imagine the internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and driverless cars will be as transformative as promoters say, driving demand for semiconductors. Support also comes from the prospect of transformative acquisitions in the wake of Avago’s $37bn acquisition of Broadcom or Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of NXP.The impact of emerging technologies is hard to gauge. That is hardly reflected in earnings multiples — profits have not kept pace with the rally and the sector is now trading at about 18 times forward earnings compared with a historical average of less than 17. Margins have actually deteriorated over the past three years.The bulls are certain a revolution is under way. Credit Suisse predicts the index will pass its dotcom bubble peak within the next two years. That may not sound racy. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed its 2000 peak in 2015; Microsoft reached it last year. But the bubble back then was more pronounced in semis than elsewhere. Getting back to that level would be unjustified unless new data merits it.Within the index, there is undoubted quality. Nvidia, which is responsible for an outsized share of the Sox’s gain, produces cutting edge graphics processing units. But the shares are already up 265 per cent in 12 months, valuing it at 25 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Perhaps better to stick with a renowned capital disciplinarian. Texas Instruments fits the bill and also has an unusually high 27 per cent effective tax rate. The revolution may be just around the corner, benefiting all the semis. Republicans cutting taxes, though, is a safer bet."
15;TXN;Texas Instruments;2017-01-24T21:58:23Z;Texas Instruments sales rise on strong auto demand;;Texas Instruments notched a better-than-expected increase in fourth-quarter revenue, driven by strong demand for chips in the automotive sector and an improvement from makers of industrial equipment.The company – seen as a bellwether for the chipmaking industry – posted quarterly revenues of $3.41bn, up 7 per cent from the same period in 2015. That beat Wall Street estimates of $3.32bn.Net profits climbed to $1.05bn, or $1.02 a share, during the most recent quarter, representing a boost over the $836m, or 80 cents a share, it reported during the same quarter last year. The per-share figure included a 14-cent benefit for items that were not in TI’s original guidance for the quarter, meaning the EPS may not be comparable to analyst estimates of 81 cents.Demand for personal electronics chips was down slightly from the previous year, TI said. That could be the latest indicator of a slowdown in the mobile-phone market, with analysts questioning whether major producers like Apple and Samsung have reached a saturation point in the developed market.TI said that it sees revenues of $3.17bn – $3.43bn in the current quarter, compared with forecasts for $3.22bn. Profits are expected to come in at 78 – 88 cents a share, including a 4 cent tax benefit. Analysts had expected profits of 75 cents a share.TI’s shares slipped 0.6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York. They have climbed 5.6 per cent this year, modestly ahead of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange’s semiconductor index, which has risen by about 4 per cent.

The figure was also higher than the upper end of the company’s own forecast of $3.34bn – 3.62bn.Net income was $968m or $0.94 per share, up from $798 or $0.76 per share a year earlier.The company’s forecast for fourth quarter revenue was $3.17bn – $3.43bn, in line with market expectations of $3.3bn. TI shares were mostly unchanged in after-market trading after hitting a 16-year high of $71.70 on Wednesday ahead of the announcement.The ability of company, which supplies components of Apple products, to weather slowing sales of the iPhone has been closely watched by analysts. Apple on Tuesday reported a 9 per cent decline in sales for the fourth fiscal quarter but said growth will return in the upcoming quarter.
17;TXN;Texas Instruments;2016-07-25T20:49:45Z;TI jumps as auto boom lifts sales;;Texas Instruments eked out its first rise in quarterly revenues in more than a year as a shift towards the booming auto and industrial sectors helped the company weather the slowdown in the personal electronics space.The Dallas-based chipmaker saw revenue rise by 1 per cent to $3.27bn, slightly ahead of forecasts that predicted sales to remain flat at $3.2bn.Net income jumped to $779m, or 76 cents during the period, up from $696m, or 65 cents a share the year before.“Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range,” said Rich Templeton, TI’s chief executive. “Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market, and grew in the industrial and communications equipment markets. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago.”Apple accounted for 11 per cent of TI’s total revenues in 2015m according to Bloomberg data and the market has been keen to get a sense of how slowing iPhone sales could impact the company’s top and bottom lines.Relief that the company’s decision to increase its exposure in the automotive, industrial, and communications segments is bearing fruit helped sent TI shares up 5.7 per cent to a near 16 year high of $70 a share in after market trading.
18;TXN;Texas Instruments;2016-03-25T15:47:22Z;Andy Grove: the man who shaped the Silicon Valley state of mind;‘Never relax, never stop evolving. Around the corner, someone is coming for you’;Silicon Valley is more a state of mind than a place. It is not a single valley — the hills around Palo Alto, Cupertino and Mountain View in northern California are not high enough to form one. Nor is its chief business now silicon, the base layer of semiconductors since the rise of companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor, Motorola, Texas Instruments and Intel.Silicon Valley’s relentless reinvention is evident in the fact that two of its best-known companies are Google (now Alphabet) and Facebook. Neither is in silicon. Google was founded only in 1998 and Facebook is even younger. It was created on the other side of the country, in a Harvard dormitory, by Mark Zuckerberg and friends in 2004.One seminal moment in Silicon Valley history occurred in 1985, as Intel lingered in what Andy Grove— the first employee of its founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore — used to call “the valley of death”. Grove, who later became Intel’s chief executive and chairman, and who died this week aged 79, meant a period when a company has been outsmarted.“I looked out of the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon [then the company’s chief executive] and I asked ‘If we got kicked out and the company brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?’” Grove wrote in Only the Paranoid Survive, his 1996 book about management.“Gordon answered without hesitation, ‘He would get us out of memories [memory chips, Intel’s founding business, which had become dominated by Japanese manufacturers].’ I stared at him, numb, then said, ‘Why shouldn’t you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?’”The title Only the Paranoid Survive gives a good indication as to the lesson Grove wanted to impart. Along with David Packard’s The HP Way, about the formation and philosophy of Hewlett-Packard, it has the ingredients of Silicon Valley’s management formula.HP pioneered the informal, participatory structure of Silicon Valley companies, while Intel embodied their fierce, relentless competitiveness. Grove popularised the idea of the “strategic inflection point,” a time in the life of a business “when its fundamentals are about to change.” Never relax, never stop evolving, because just around the corner someone is coming for you.Yahoo, a founding company of the internet era, is now in the valley of death. Marissa Mayer, the chief executive brought in from Google to try to salvage it from a strategic mess, has not succeeded. Starboard, an activist hedge fund, called this week for its entire board of directors to be fired.Facebook, conversely, is doing extremely well — it has 1.6bn monthly active users around the world, and its strength in online and mobile advertising brought in revenues of nearly $18bn last year. It occupies a position in social networking akin to Intel’s in microprocessors during the 1990s: clear domination. Facebook’s debt to HP is visible at its campus headquarters in Palo Alto on the outskirts of Stanford University. There is a Walt Disney-like boardwalk by its main building along which employees stroll in the sunshine, pick up ice cream and food from carts, then cycle to its building, designed by Frank Gehry, architect of the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao.But Mr Zuckerberg has also learnt from Grove. The Facebook founder was photographed last week beaming as he took a jog in Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City in Beijing, without the face mask needed to block the city’s hazardous air pollution. Later he met Liu Yunshan, China’s propaganda chief.His intention was clear: Facebook has many users but China has nearly 1.4bn citizens who cannot yet join because it is blocked. China also has a globally ambitious industry led by companies such as Alibaba, much like the Japanese companies that rose against Intel in the 1980s. Mr Zuckerberg will endure a lot — including learning Mandarin — to counter the threat.It was very painful when Mr Moore and Grove changed course, pivoting to focus on microprocessors, then a smaller business for Intel than memory chips. “Intel equalled memories in all of our minds. How could we give up our identity?” Grove wrote. But he imposed a revolution, closing seven factories in a company-saving coup.Grove’s determination to confront reality rather than to indulge in sentiment may have been instilled by being an immigrant. He was born Andras Grof to Hungarian Jewish parents, changing his name when he fled to the US as the 1956 uprising was put down by the Soviet Union.Grove was not the only demanding Silicon Valley boss — Steve Jobs at Apple and Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle, could be just as tough, and both founded their companies. But he was fiercely devoted to Intel’s success.The lesson for Silicon Valley, and other industries facing change, is to recall Grove’s ruthlessness.

19;TXN;Texas Instruments;2016-01-28T02:21:49Z;Apple shares tumble on iPhone sales forecast;$35bn wiped from market value of world’s most valuable company;Apple shares closed down 6.6 per cent on Wednesday, their third-largest single-day decline in a decade, after the company forecast a drop in sales of the iPhone.Shares in Apple closed at $93.44, their lowest level since mid-2014, after a warning by Tim Cook that iPhone sales would see their first year-on-year decline in the March quarter, amid what the Apple chief described as “extreme conditions” in the global economy.The world’s most valuable company by market capitalisation was caught in a wider stock market sell-off on Wednesday that saw the Nasdaq Composite close 2.2 per cent lower, adding to Apple’s most drastic single-day decline in two years. Apple shed more than $35bn in market value, equivalent to the market capitalisation of Delta Air Lines or FedEx.It extends the slide in Apple stock this year to 9.3 per cent as investors grow more concerned over cooling sales growth. The shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent since hitting a record high early last year.Even among the many Wall Street analysts who recommend buying Apple stock — with the consensus 12-month price target of $136.17 suggesting 43 per cent upside from current levels — there are fears that its shares may have further to fall before investor sentiment improves.“The bottom line is that we still like [Apple], but don’t expect a quick rebound,” Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie, wrote in a note to clients.Deutsche Bank’s Sherri Scribner said that a year-over-year decline in revenues in the Americas segment could indicate “possible saturation in [Apple’s] biggest market”. Ms Scribner also said commentary from management about potential volatility in China was “less than encouraging”.In the Americas, Apple’s largest region, operating income fell by 6 per cent to $10.0bn in its fiscal first quarter, while in Europe it declined by almost 2 per cent. However, operating income in greater China grew by 19 per cent to $7.6bn for the quarter, according to a regulatory filing published on Wednesday.R&D expenses, meanwhile, leapt by 27 per cent to $2.4bn in the latest quarter, as Mr Cook insisted Apple was not “retrenching”. “We are continuing to invest without pause,” he said. “We have some great things in the pipeline.”Wednesday’s filing also showed that off-balance sheet capital and purchasing commitments related to product tooling, inventory prepayments and R&D almost doubled to $7.9bn in the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. Off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, meanwhile, fell slightly year on year from $21.6bn in December 2014 to $20.7bn at the end of last year.Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, said the increase in advance commitments may indicate a change in how Apple manages its supply chain.“We had been hearing from certain suppliers Apple was ordering more components than it seems necessary for builds the next quarter,” Mr Bajarin said. “They could be doing this to get preferential pricing upfront or to keep their suppliers’ capacity high to make sure they meet demand.”Slowing demand for the iPhone is still affecting Apple suppliers large and small. Qualcomm, a leading supplier of mobile processors, warned on Wednesday of “some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer”, a reference analysts took to mean Apple.“There is a little softness in the premium tier, somewhat of a product-cycle issue, in terms of upgrades and the replacement cycle,” Derek Aberle, Qualcomm’s president, said in an interview. “We are seeing that offset particularly in China. The market there is actually very strong despite some of the macro issues.”Texas Instruments, another chipmaker, also warned in its outlook on Wednesday of “softness . . . within the personal electronics market” amounting to a $150m revenue shortfall compared with a year ago, which analysts again attributed to Apple.
20;TXN;Texas Instruments;2015-02-02T00:11:50Z;The unsung pioneers of the information age;Flair of Intel’s Robert Noyce and vision of Douglas Englebart helped shape the tech market;If financial success were the sole measure of business genius, the computer age could lay claim to more than its fair share of the great figures of business history.Measured by the scale of their personal fortunes alone, it would be hard to deny those such as Bill Gates (Microsoft), Larry Ellison (Oracle), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) a place alongside the likes of John D and other Rockefellers or Andrew Carnegie from an earlier era. And few have succeeded as spectacularly in defining massive new markets as Steve Jobs of Apple, whose sequence of hits from the Mac to the iPad have helped shape the experience of computing for more than 30 years.The money alone, however, does not tell the whole story. The winner-takes-all nature of many tech markets has added to the outsized gains, magnifying the returns to those who are both smart and lucky enough to catch the first wave of each new era of technology. And even the ultimate winners have not always shown the surest business touch: Bill Gates did not believe there was good money to be made in selling operating systems until business partner Paul Allen persuaded him to charge for the software, rather than just giving it away.In particular, the catalogue of tech riches fails to take into account the vast impact of figures whose ideas shaped today’s tech markets and made later advances possible, even if they did not personally profit to the same degree. Some were visionaries who anticipated how rudimentary technologies would come to transform large swaths of business and society. Others built important businesses that laid the foundation for the giant fortunes that were to follow.For visionary brilliance, it is hard to top Douglas Englebart, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) scientist who dreamt of making computing personal. Usually, technology development is an incremental affair, as researchers build on each others’ achievements to come up with an ultimate product. But with personal computing, Englebart had it all worked out, nearly 15 years before the first PC hit the market.Englebart is known primarily for inventing the computer mouse, but it was his vision of the way the elements of hardware, software and online service could come together that provided the first model for how today’s highly networked personal computing world might operate.In a demonstration, staged in San Francisco as long ago as 1968, he led an SRI team that gave a glimpse of the future: not just using a mouse to manipulate windows and text on a screen, but also using a network to collaborate and videoconference with people in a different location and showing how hypertext could make it easier to uncover information.It took a string of technical breakthroughs at Xerox’s research centre in Silicon Valley, as well as the creative genius of Jobs and the business relentlessness of Gates, to bring personal computing to a mass market. But it was Englebart who had shown what was possible.The PC age, meanwhile — along with much else that has followed — has relied on one underlying technology engine more than any other: the exponential growth in processing power that has come from packing ever more transistors on to a silicon chip. Robert Noyce, who played a key role in three pioneering chip companies, did as much as anyone to bring that about, as well as to build the culture of today’s Silicon Valley.The co-founder and first chief executive of Intel, Noyce has been overshadowed by others in the history of chip making. They include people such as his Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, whose name is enshrined in “Moore’s law” that predicts the rate of efficiency gains in chips, and by the swashbuckling Andy Grove, a later Intel chief executive who took the company from memory chips to world dominance in microprocessors.It was also Noyce’s misfortune to lose out to Texas Instruments scientist Jack Kilby, who was the first to come up with a design for an integrated circuit months before Noyce independently made his own breakthrough. Kilby went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics — although Noyce was later given credit for his own advances in the field.Yet it was Noyce who turned Intel’s breakthroughs into a world-beating business. After working at Shockley, the first silicon chip company in Silicon Valley, he was chief executive of the breakaway Fairchild Semiconductor before founding Intel. It was on his watch that Intel devised a new style in corporate management that helped shape the valley, giving up the normal trappings of a corporate hierarchy in favour of a can-do egalitarianism and informality.Figures such as Englebart and Noyce never enjoyed the same acclaim as the tech world’s multibillionaires. But they, and many others, still have a solid claim to being considered true pioneers of the information age.
21;TXN;Texas Instruments;2014-10-07T16:28:10Z;Tech groups push White House for more work permits;Silicon Valley’s lobbying focus shifts to executive action to help hire foreign-born staff;Tech groups including Intel, Texas Instruments and Facebook-linked lobbyists are urging the White House to bypass Congress and use its executive powers to help them secure more work permits for foreign-born recruits.Businesses that need large numbers of programmers and engineers have long complained that the US immigration system does not allow them to hire enough of the overseas workers they want, including many from India.Deadlock in Congress has prevented changes to the law, so the tech groups have shifted their focus to lobbying the White House to take unilateral action, using executive powers that President Barack Obama is already priming to slow the deportation of unauthorised immigrants.Lawyers from Intel and two trade groups are among those encouraging action in “conversations” with Obama administration lawyers, according to the groups.One of the groups counts Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as its main financial backer. The other business coalition pushing for action is Compete America, whose members include Microsoft, Google, Amazon and IBM.Peter Muller, director of immigration policy at Intel, said more than half of graduates with advanced degrees in engineering, science and maths from the US universities where the company recruits were born outside the country but face a shortage of work visas and residency permits.“While it’s clear Congress is not going to do anything in the near term, we believe the president has authority he can use to make changes that are not going to solve our problems, but will make it easier for us to hire the people we need,” Mr Muller told the Financial Times.The tech groups’ effort is binding the fortunes of two divergent sections of the US labour force: often low-paid unauthorised immigrants who play an important role in agriculture, construction and the service sector, and highly-skilled workers who power Silicon Valley.In early September the White House announced that it would delay until after November’s midterm elections its expected action on deportations – expulsions that have triggered harsh criticism of the president from some of his supporters – so the issue would not become excessively politicised.Todd Schulte, acting president of Fwd.us, the group backed by Mr Zuckerberg, said: “The president has indicated his team is still exploring their options, but that he’ll take steps to address some of the urgent problems plaguing our broken immigration system.”Mr Schulte called for “big and broad action that makes fixes to the legal visa system that will help businesses create jobs”, as well as steps to remove the deportation threat hanging over some 11m unauthorised immigrants, many of whom have lived in the US for years.While it’s clear Congress is not going to do anything in the near term, we believe the president has authority he can use to make changes that are not going to solve our problems, but will make it easier for us to hire the people we needThe tech effort is controversial. A spokesman for the AFL-CIO, the US’s biggest union federation, said: “Immigrant workers haven’t been organising in support of executive action to halt needless deportations in order to allow tech companies to expand outdated guest worker programmes. Given stagnant wages for [science, technology, engineering and maths] workers for more than a decade, claims that there is a shortage of qualified high skilled workers fall as flat as the pay for engineers in the United States.”The tech groups say Mr Obama could free up more permanent residency permits known as green cards by “recapturing” some 200,000 that went unused in previous years. He could also stop counting the spouses and children of green card recipients towards the US’s annual allotment of 140,000 employment-based green cards, some argue.The groups acknowledge that the president does not have the power to create more short-term H1B visas for highly-skilled workers. But the visas point to the origins of the workers tech companies want to hire: 64 per cent of the 262,569 H1Bs approved in 2012 went to people born in India.“In order for us to remain competitive we need to be able to hire these folks that our universities are graduating regardless of their nationality,” said Gene Irisari, director of government relations at Texas Instruments. “In the end we’re looking for any help we can get with our situation because it is so dire.”A White House spokeswoman said the president had directed officials to identify steps he could take on immigration using his existing authority. “As part of this process, the administration has engaged a wide range of stakeholders including from the business sector and has solicited input from groups and individuals representing a diverse set of views,” she said.Last week a group of 62 Democratic lawmakers wrote to the president to urge him to use his executive powers to help bring more high-skilled immigrants to the US. The members of the House of Representatives were led by Jared Polis, Joaquin Castro and Joe Garcia.
22;TXN;Texas Instruments;2014-06-02T18:44:46Z;Broadcom eyes options for mobile chip unit;;Chip designer Broadcom said on Monday that it was looking to sell or wind down one of its phone-related divisions, another sign of consolidation in the mobile chip industry as the growth in smartphone sales slows.The California-based company said it was exploring options for its cellular baseband division, which makes the chips that help phones connect to mobile networks. Divestiture would save Broadcom around $700m a year, some of which it will reinvest in research, it said.Other US chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and Freescale have quit the mobile chip business. Broadcom said it had hired JPMorgan as an adviser but cautioned that the work was not guaranteed to lead to a sale.“It remains to be seen whether Broadcom will find a buyer for its baseband business as historically Freescale, ST-Ericsson, TI and Renesas Mobile all struggled to sell their baseband businesses,” said Stuart Robinson at Strategy Analytics.The market for baseband chips is highly competitive and led by Qualcomm, another California-based group that has aggressively invested in developing new products and gaining market share.Qualcomm’s market share is 58 per cent, while Broadcom now has 4 per cent, according to researcher Forward Concepts.Phonemakers have also moved away from having a specialised chip for each function – running applications, connecting to cellular and wifi networks, and for bluetooth connections – and instead towards having only one integrated chip that performs all those functions. This has hurt Broadcom, which remained a specialist in chips that provide connectivity functions only even as Qualcomm and MediaTek increasingly provided integrated chips.Broadcom also raised its guidance for the upcoming quarter, saying it expected gross product margin to be near or above the high end of the forecasted range.
23;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Weak global economy affects Texas Instruments;;Texas Instruments, the world’s third-biggest chipmaker by revenues, reported falling sales and forecast fourth-quarter revenues below expectations because of weakening economic conditions.In a similar move to Intel, its bigger rival, TI said it was reducing production at its factories because of falling demand for its semiconductors.“Our market has weakened and we expect it will remain so in the fourth quarter as the overall world economy continues to be soft,” said Kevin March, chief financial officer.The Dallas-based chipmaker predicted earnings per share of 23 to 31 cents on fourth-quarter revenues of $2.83bn-$3.07bn, which would be down 13 per cent at the middle of the range, compared to the third quarter. Analysts expected earnings of 37 cents a share on revenues of $3.22bn.TI has been repositioning itself in the analogue and embedded-chip sectors and now relies on them for 70 per cent of revenue. There have been rumours of a sale of its mobile device business, making baseband and Omap processors.“We realise there are questions regarding our plans for Omap and connectivity products sold in the smartphone and tablet spaces,” Mr March said.“We are actively working on these plans, but at this point in time, we don’t have anything new to share.”TI reported third-quarter revenues of $3.39bn, down 2 per cent on a year ago, but net income rose 30 per cent to $784m, helped by changes to a pension programme.
24;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-09-26T22:34:00Z;Imagination hit by US partner’s retreat;;Shares in Imagination Technologies lost nearly a tenth of their value on Wednesday after one of the UK chipmaker’s long-term partners said it was backing away from the smartphone and tablet markets.The decision by Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by revenues, to refocus away from smartphone and tablet chips had a knock-on effect on Imagination, which counts the Dallas-based group as one of its biggest customers.At an investor conference in New York on Tuesday, Texas Instruments – thought to be one of Imagination’s top three royalty payers – said the emergence of a few large players and changing market trends had made its chips for smartphones and tablets “less attractive”.Analysts suggested that the move would knock an estimated £10m – about 12 per cent – from Imagination Technologies’ full-year revenues, and shares in the London-listed group closed down 9.62 per cent on Wednesday at 470p.The share price fall wiped out recent gains for Imagination, whose blueprints are in the core A6 processor chip used in the iPhone 5, following last Friday’s launch of Apple’s flagship smartphone.“This is clearly a material negative for Imagination,” said James Goodman at Investec. “This could affect up to 20 per cent of [pro forma] group profits over time.”Mr Goodman said that the £10m hit to Imagination’s top line “would not disappear immediately, and could potentially be won back through other accounts, but a significant proportion of devices could move to Qualcomm, Nvidia and others using their own graphics chips, or those who are partners of rival Arm Holdings”.Dan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investments Research, said the fall in Imagination’s shares highlighted how vulnerable the company was on a few key clients.Although Imagination has never confirmed it, the group is especially dependent on Apple contracts, with an estimated 40 per cent of its technology division’s revenue stemming from the US device manufacturer.This is in contrast to Arm Holdings, which is more dominant in its market segment.Imagination and Arm have traded on similar multiples, earlier this year, close to 40 times forward earnings estimates. However, recent share price falls have put Imagination on a discount to Arm, which Mr Ridsdale said was justified.“It shows that Arm Holdings is the higher quality business. Imagination is not dominant in its market the same way that Arm is. Imagination has a number of strong competitors including Arm and Qualcomm,” he said.Texas Instruments’ decision was sparked by it being superseded as the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for wireless devices, having been overtaken in recent years by its US rival Qualcomm.Device makers Apple and Samsung have been designing their own mobile chips, further eating into Texas Instruments’ markets. Texas Instruments has an estimated 10 customers and $900m in annual revenues for its smartphone and tablet chips.
25;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Texas Instruments retreats from smartphones;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by revenues, is beating a retreat from the smartphone and tablet markets as competition intensifies.Once the leading manufacturer of chips for wireless devices globally, TI has been overtaken in recent years by its US rival Qualcomm, while new entrants such as Nvidia and Intel have appeared and device makers Apple and Samsung have been designing their own mobile chips.The chipmaker, based in Dallas, Texas, told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that TI’s chips for smartphones and tablets were “less attractive” with the emergence of a few large players and changing market trends.It would be “reprofiling” its investment in those markets and concentrating on addressing the broader market of embedded processing, the company said. TI makes a wide range of chips for many different industries.“In effect, the company will stop investing in R&D for new products in those markets, and instead focus on a more horizontal approach,” said Sumit Dhanda, semiconductor analyst with the International Strategy and Investment group, in a note.ISI estimates TI has 10 customers and $900m in annual revenues for its smartphone and tablet chips. Its shares closed 3 per cent lower at $27.83 on the news.A TI processor features in the new Kindle Fire HD tablet, but its only input in the iPhone 5 is a touchscreen controller chip, according to the IHS iSuppli research firm.That showed Qualcomm provided the baseband wireless processor for the handset and Samsung manufactured Apple’s A6 microprocessor.
26;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-08-07T12:57:35Z;US corporate debt feeds investors’ hunger;;“A buffet line with two doors”, is how Richard Cheng, a portfolio manager at TIAA-CREF, describes the US investment grade debt markets in which he works.Pouring in from one end are cautious types who might normally buy super-safe government debt, but who are now favouring the bonds of large, high-quality companies in search of a decent investment return.At the other end are investors who would normally opt for riskier junk bonds or equities, but who are nervous about the economic outlook and potential changes to US tax and spending plans after November’s presidential election.As a result, “there is not enough prime rib at the carving station to satisfy demand”, says Mr Cheng. Sales of debt for top names have been heavily subscribed, with companies including IBM, Unilever and Texas Instruments all selling debt at record low yields last month. Yields move inversely to prices.Banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have had to pay more, but even they have been able to issue 30-year debt to eager investors only four years after the financial crisis and amid persistent worries about the health of eurozone banks.Such demand is in part a result of government policy. Low Treasury yields are a key aim of the US Federal Reserve as it continues with Operation Twist until the end of the year. By purchasing large amounts of long-term Treasury paper and putting downward pressure on yields, Twist has encouraged investors to seek higher yields from corporate debt.Pension and retirement funds and insurance companies have been negligible buyers of US Treasury debt at auctions this year as benchmark Treasury yields have fallen to historic lows, according to official data.These investors have not purchased 10-year notes at an auction since last December and not bought 30-year debt since April, when the “long” bond was yielding about 3.20 per cent, down from a high of 3.5 per cent in March. Last month it set a record low of 2.44 per cent.“What you’ve seen is a real attempt by defined benefit pension schemes to match their liabilities, to move some of their assets into long duration credit portfolios,” says James Hirschmann, chief executive of Western Asset Management.US defined benefit pension funds have cut their allocation to equities from 72 per cent of overall assets in 2006 to as low as 52 per cent in 2011, according to Fed data. In turn, credit exposure was more than 34 per cent of assets at the end of the first quarter in 2012, up from a fifth in 2006.Pension funds are not charging in blindly. Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of the $120bn California State Teachers’ Retirement System, is searching for incremental income where he can find it and says low absolute levels of bond yields mean “corporate credit is fairly tight”. But the reality of the current environment is that investors are engaged in a search for “the cleanest dirty shirt”.And there is a puzzle. Even though yields are low, in relative terms, the difference between the interest rate available on US government debt and investment grade credit is actually comparatively wide. There has not been a default in this market in two years, yet the spread – or premium – over Treasuries implies a default rate of more than 11 per cent over the next five years, says Mr Hirshmann. During the Great Depression, by comparison, the default rate was just 5 per cent.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, analyst at JPMorgan, says that “credit spreads in Japan measured in basis points are two to three times smaller than their US counterparts of the same rating”, yet are comparable in absolute yield terms.The answer may be because, even as the universe of bond investors interested in absolute yield has risen, cash dedicated to spread investing by hedge funds and banks’ proprietary trading desks has shrunk, as has the leverage used by such funds.Yields, then, could have further to fall, particularly if pension funds continue to favour corporate debt. A lasting shift may encourage companies to take advantage of cheap financing over longer periods: at Disney, for instance, the spread over Treasuries for its 10-year debt is 64bp, and an investor lending it money for a further 20 years receives only an extra 6bp in return.And there lies a dilemma for investors. If the demand depresses returns further, they could soon be asking, again, where to turn for yield.
27;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-07-30T22:07:33Z;US blue-chips lock in low interest rates;;A slew of US corporate debt sales on Monday was led by Unilever and Texas Instruments selling bonds at record low coupon yields.The surge in debt sales comes as investment grade corporate bond yields, which move inversely to prices, are at or near record lows, providing companies with the ability to lock in long-term funding cheaply.“These companies are funding themselves at remarkably cheap rates,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “It’s very sensible from their standpoint to lock in borrowing at these rates.”Large inflows into fixed income bond funds also leave portfolio managers searching for quality bonds, creating a sweet spot for such companies to issue deals.Unilever Capital sold $450m of three-year debt at a record low coupon yield of 0.45 per cent, eclipsing the 0.55 per cent mark set by IBM in February for debt of that maturity. Texas Instruments also sold $750m of three-year debt at a coupon of 0.45 per cent.Unilever sold $550m of five-year debt with a coupon of 0.85 per cent, setting a record low for investment grade debt of that maturity by beating last week’s 0.875 per cent sale from Bristol-Myers Squibb.This comes after IBM last week sold $1bn in 10-year debt at a coupon of 1.875 per cent, the lowest interest rate for bonds of that maturity sold in the US, according to Dealogic, the data tracker. Companies such as 3M and McDonald's have also sold debt this year at record low yields as investors seek higher returns than US Treasury yields in so-called blue-chip names.“Most of the deals are from high-quality companies that are attractive for investors,” said Jason Brady, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.Given the number of benchmark deals set to price, overall issuance was in the region of at least $10bn on Monday with a $1.25bn three-part deal from Campbell Soup. Teck Resources sold a $1.75bn three-part issue and TransCanada Pipelines sold $1bn 10-year notes. America Movil sold $750m of 10- and 30-year paper.That stood to push July’s debt sales towards $68bn, eclipsing the prior record for the month set in 2010 when there was $58.7bn issued.The average yield on US investment grade corporate bonds was near a record low as measured by a Barclays index. The yield on the index, which dates back to 1973, closed out last week at 2.96 per cent.Yields for industrial companies averaged 2.85 per cent, while financials were at 3.24 per cent, according to Barclays.Banks have been attracting greater interest from investors in recent weeks, helping narrow their spreads over those of industrial or non-financial issuers.
28;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-07-10T17:22:06Z;Micron / Elpida – value judgment;Bondholders of the Japanese chipmaker are taking a big gamble;Rescue ahoy (almost). When US chipmaker Micron sent out a lifeline to Elpida last week by offering to buy it, the Japanese chipmaker’s survival seemed assured. That was until Elpida’s bondholders announced that the offer undervalued the company and that they could do better. On Monday, in a filing to a Tokyo district court (which must approve the deal) they said they would present an alternative proposal. That looks decidedly risky.Micron’s offer values Elpida at Y200bn ($2.5bn) and includes Y60bn in cash up front for all of Elpida’s equity. That is double the norm for typical deals. Indeed, if Micron were simply to buy all of Elpida’s existing capacity, it would cost the US company 70 per cent more. The rest of the offer – Y140bn – will be paid to Elpida’s creditors in annual instalments through 2019.Bondholders hold about half of Elpida’s debt of Y300bn. The deal may mean that they do not get their money back immediately. They argue that the current conditions do not guarantee the instalments will ever be paid. After all, Micron is offering to make the payments through Elpida’s cash flow. Still, by buying Elpida, Micron morphs into the world’s second-largest maker of dynamic random access memory chips, from fourth place today. That scale should boost performance and help both companies return to profit.If creditors block the deal, all of that is at risk. When a creditor-backed rescue saved Japan Airlines in 2010, creditors waived almost 90 per cent of unsecured loans. Without a buyer, Elpida would go into liquidation. When Texas Instruments scooped up assets from the bankrupt German chipmaker Qimonda in 2009 it paid roughly 18 cents on the dollar for equipment. A read-through to Elpida suggests that the liquidation value of Elpida’s property, plant and equipment is just Y60bn, Macquarie estimates. Is that all creditors want?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Mr Waterhouse, previously was chief executive of Harcourt Education, a competitor in the US school education sector. He also spent 26 years at IBM, where he was general manager of ebusiness services.“My lifetime commitment to learning and to technology convinces me that it’s time to accelerate the transformation to digital education,” Mr Waterhouse said in a statement.With Mr Waterhouse’s appointment, two of the four biggest educational publishers now have chief executives with an extensive background in technology. The selections signal the growing importance of digital in the education publishing business.Linda Zecher, who started as chief executive of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in September 2011, previously worked at the technology companies Microsoft, Texas Instruments and Oracle.McGraw-Hill announced in September last year that it would separate its financial and education businesses into two companies. The decision came in response to pressure to ramp up growth and boost returns to investors. In December, the company said that it would cut 550 jobs in its education division and alter pension plans to save $50m.McGraw-Hill competes in education with Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, Cengage, a publisher bought in 2006 by the private equity group Apax, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

It has been flirting with $600 and a $550bn market capitalisation since the unveiling of the new iPad last week.Analysts view the device as consolidating Apple’s lead over other tablet makers such as Samsung and Amazon and generating better sales than initially expected.In anticipation of strong demand for the new iPad, the IDC research firm this week raised its 2012 forecast for worldwide tablet shipments by 21 per cent to 106.1m tablets.Canaccord Genuity analysts said their checks “indicated record pre-orders, with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching two to three weeks”.They predicted Apple would capture more than 80 per cent of the tablet industry’s profits in 2012, selling 65.6m iPads, compared with an earlier forecast of 55.9m. They raised their share-price target to $710 from $665. Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley went further, setting a base-case price target of $720 and a bull case of $960. Of 56 analysts tracking Apple, only one has a sell rating, Bloomberg data shows.The launch of the new iPad represents Apple’s fastest international rollout of the product, with consumers around the world able to queue and buy the device ahead of those in the US for the first time, if only by a few hours: it goes on sale at 8am local time in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the US.It will be available from March 23 in 25 more countries, with analysts expecting the launch to have a meaningful impact on revenues for Apple’s March quarter.The new iPad features a quad-core graphics processor for improved gaming, an upgraded camera and faster internet connectivity, including a 4G LTE broadband option aimed mainly at US users.Its main attraction is a new “Retina” high-definition screen, with pixels packed so tightly the eye cannot discern them.Despite a bitter rivalry with Samsung in smartphones and tablets that has led to patent suits being brought around the world, the South Korean company is the main supplier of the screen at launch, according to the IHS iSuppli research firm, with LG Display and Sharp also providing small quantities.Samsung has had limited success in tablets with its Galaxy series and analysts are seeing signs that demand for Amazon’s Kindle Fire, a lower-cost competitor in the US, is flagging. They attributed lowered revenue guidance from component supplier Texas Instruments last week to a loss of momentum for the $200 Fire – a situation that is unlikely to improve with Apple continuing to sell the iPad 2, but now at a price tag lowered by $100.
31;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-02-28T22:11:06Z;Semiconductor stocks drive Nasdaq rally;;The Nasdaq Composite index hit fresh 11-year highs as Apple shares reached record levels and semiconductor stocks continued to rally on hopes that the bankruptcy filing of Japanese chipmakerElpida would drive up prices of computer memory.The Philadelphia index of semiconductor stocks climbed 1.6 per cent with three-quarters of its constituents posting record gains.Micron Technology, which stands to benefit from an Elpida retreat from the dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) market, rose 3.7 per cent to $8.88. Its shares are up 14 per cent this week and at their highest level since last June. Novellus Systems also climbed 3.7 per cent to $47.02.However, Nomura analysts – who on Monday had said D-Ram prices would not recover until late in 2012 because of continued disruption to the supply chain for personal computers – posted another downbeat note.They forecast weak demand for semiconductor chips from android smartphone makers, which they said would lose market share to Apple’s iPhones.“The Android tablet market is likely dead …Most of the tier 1 phones lack differentiation …Apple has done it again,” Romit Shah told Nomura clients from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Apple shares increased 1.8 per cent to close at a fresh high of $535.41 on reports it would launch a much-discussed television product alongside the expected introduction of new iPad models in March. That took Apple’s market capitalisation over $500bn, taking it about $90bn clear of ExxonMobil as the world’s largest publicly traded company.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.7 per cent to 2,986.76, having earlier hit 2,988.59. The tech-heavy index is now up by almost 15 per cent for the year compared with a 9 per cent gain for the benchmark S&P 500 as tech stocks – and Apple in particular – drive market gains.The S&P 500 also hit a post-financial crisis high of 1,373.09 before retreating slightly to 1,372.18 for a gain of 0.3 per cent. Investors brushed off an unexpectedly large fall in durable goods orders as other economic data surprised on the upside.“1,377 is a big level of resistance for the S&P 500, where investors may take profit or put on hedges to protect against falls,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “If we push through that, the expectation is the market will rally to 1,400, which would be psychologically important for confidence.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 13,005.12, finally closing above 13,000 for the first time since 2008 having repeatedly fallen back after breaching the psychological barrier several times in intraday trading on Monday and last week.Shares in Priceline.com climbed 7 per cent to $632.76 as the largest US online travel agent by market capitalisation beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales forecasts.Citigroup analysts tipped the shares to reach $850 within 12 months, praising the company’s European sales growth and saying the website’s appeal to value-hunting consumers meant the company “enjoys something of a counter­cyclical hedge in the US”.That triggered a wider rally in online travel companies, with fellow travel agent Expedia up 2 per cent to $33.79.However, analysts said there was limited read across from Priceline’s results to peers.“This is company-specific: Priceline is reaping the rewards of strong investment in advertising and on hotel space in Europe,” said Scott Kessler at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray added that Priceline’s international booking growth was four times greater than Expedia’s.Herman Leung at Susquehanna said Google stood to benefit most with Priceline set to deploy its increasing cash flow to increased spending on online advertising.Google shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $618.39.TripAdvisor, the travel review website spun off from Expedia in December, which relies on advertising by travel companies, was up 1.3 per cent to $32.31.Yahoo shares climbed 0.6 per cent to $14.94 as the company claimed Facebook had infringed on some of its patents.A similar claim by the company against Google shortly before the search giant’s IPO resulted in Yahoo receiving shares in Google as part of a settlement.Shares in the for-profit educator Apollo Group fell 16.3 per cent to $43.04 after the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast and said new degree enrolment in the current quarter would fall short of previous expectations.Shares in Cablevision fell 6 per cent to $14.70 as fourth-quarter profit almost halved compared with the same period in 2011. The cable company lost 14,000 video subscribers during the quarter, far more than analysts had expected.Bank stocks were firm with Bank of America up 1 per cent to $8.12. JPMorgan analysts were upbeat on the bank’s “progress towards resolving its large mortgage issues”.JPMorgan climbed 0.9 per cent to $39.42 as the bank unexpectedly revealed trading revenue by asset class, and announced it would scale back a branch expansion plan at its analyst day.
32;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
33;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-01-24T18:01:43Z;Chipmakers’ results raise fears about Nokia;;Warnings about poor sales from two of Nokia’s key chipmaker suppliers have raised fears that the Finnish handset manufacturer has seen a slump in demand for its older mobile phones.Nokia shares dropped by 6.9 per cent to €4.10 on Tuesday on concerns that sales of its Symbian smartphones may have fallen by more than expected, in a worrying signal ahead of its full-year results on Thursday 26 January.ST Ericsson, which supplies wireless chips to Nokia’s handsets using its Symbian and Meego operating systems, reported widened losses of $841m for 2011 and warned of a “significant sequential decline” in sales the first quarter because of poor sales at Nokia, which accounts for around 30 per cent of the company’s business. Symbian accounts for the majority of Nokia’s smartphone sales.“The revenues from Nokia have collapsed and this is why revenues at ST Ericsson are not what we expected,” said Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of ST Microelectronics, which owns half of ST Ericsson.Didier Lamouche, chief executive of ST Ericsson, said: “It is clear that both sales and operating results will continue to be challenging over the coming quarters, due to the reduction in the short term of new product sales with one of our largest customers.”On Monday night, Texas Instruments, which supplies what are called baseband chips for older Nokia phones, also warned that revenue in that business would fall to $75m in the first quarter, from $279m in the fourth quarter.The warnings prompted Danske Bank to downgrade its recommendation for Nokia shares to “sell”. It estimates that a larger-than-expected decline in Symbian sales will result in operating losses for the fourth quarter of 2011 and for 2012.Nokia is abandoning its old Symbian operating system in favour of using Microsoft’s Windows phone platform in its smartphones, as it tries tries to compete with popular Apple and Google-based phones. Nokia is expected to sell around 1m to 2m of the new Windows-based phones, which use chips from Qualcomm rather than ST Ericsson and TI, in the fourth quarter.However, Windows-based smartphones still represent only a small fraction of Nokia’s total phone sales. Analysts had expected a slow decline in Symbian phone sales which they say are essential to help cushion the company in the early stages of the Windows phones roll-out.“Nokia is between a rock and a hard place,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. “Sentiment towards Symbian has fallen through the floor.”Analysts are expecting Nokia to announce earnings per share of €0.04, an 82 per cent decline from last year.
34;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-01-11T19:44:04Z;Intel: smartphone chips are down;Even if the products roll out as promised, there is still a long way to go;"About time. Intel’s chips will finally to be found in smartphones this year. The company announced on Tuesday that Lenovo would release a phone with an Intel processor in China in the second quarter, and that Motorola would ship Intel phones in the second half. But the real hurdles are gaining significant market share and making money.Even if the products roll out as promised, Intel will have a long way to go in a market where chips based on Arm Holdings’ designs have 100 per cent market share. Why would handset makers rush to Intel when Arm licensees from Qualcomm to Nvidia to Texas Instruments are already competing for their business, and their software is already a proved fit with Arm designs?Intel has a history of paying up for a foothold in a new business. The company invested $1.6bn in Clearwire in the hope of cultivating WiMax wireless technology, aimed at breaking up the iron grip of Qualcomm’s CDMA. Intel may be protecting Motorola and Lenovo from any downside on the new products. But as the failure of WiMax highlights, even Intel is not rich enough to buy its way in to an established market.Smartphone sales grew by more than 40 per cent in the third quarter, when 115m units were sold, according to Gartner. But smartphone processors are much cheaper than PC processors, at
$10-$15 a pop. So even if Intel can take an impressive 25 per cent share in a year or two – and sell a lot of chips into tablets, too – it might sell $2bn in mobile chips. That is a respectable number, but it is hardly huge in the context of Intel’s $55bn in sales this year. It is no wonder that Intel wants to reignite PC sales with high-end “ultrabooks”.An aggressive entry by Intel could hurt the margins of Arm or its licensees. Near term, they may have more to fear than Intel has to gain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
35;TXN;Texas Instruments;2012-01-06T22:56:18Z;Transfers outweigh IPOs at Nasdaq OMX;Exchange saw a net gain in market cap of $50bn;Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, added more market capitalisation by poaching listings from its rival, NYSE Euronext, than by taking companies public last year.Nasdaq saw a net gain in market capitalisation of $50bn as 34 companies switched their listings between the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange markets in 2011. That dwarfed the $10.5bn raised by the 78 companies that listed on the Nasdaq last year after initial public offerings.Its is the third time in four years that Nasdaq has attracted more market capitalisation through listings transfers than through IPOs, although Bob McCooey, head of listings at Nasdaq, denied NYSE defections were becoming more important than attracting new listings.“We’re pleased that companies are recognising the benefits we offer but we are not looking at listings transfers as a short-term filler for the fact that there has not been a lot of IPO activity,” he said.Nasdaq did win the high-profile IPOs of tech start-ups Groupon and Zynga, although market volatility in the second half of the year led many companies to delay listing.Mr McCooey said this should lead to a bumper 2012, with 112 US companies filed with the SEC to list on Nasdaq, slightly higher than the number filed to list at NYSE.However, 2011 was a third successive lean year for IPOs on the Nasdaq, with $8.8bn raised in 2010 and $7.6bn in 2009. In 2008 and 2009 combined, Nasdaq attracted $100bn more through listings transfers than IPOs, with IPOs only exceeding listings transfers in 2010.The data came to light as the two exchange groups battled for bragging rights over company defection, in what is becoming an annual ritual.Until recently, the flow was almost exclusively one way, with several companies switching from NYSE to Nasdaq, but since 2007 competition has increased as the NYSE began allowing four-letter ticker symbols to be transferred from Nasdaq.Nasdaq prospered in market cap terms in 2011, attracting $80bn of market cap from the NYSE, including Viacom and Texas Instruments, while $30bn moved the other way.But NYSE was more successful in poaching companies. Twenty-four companies went from Nasdaq to the NYSE, twice the number that moved in the other direction. That included SuccessFactors, which cited NYSE’s pending merger with Deutsche Börse as a key attraction.With BATS now also cleared to accept listings, competition between exchanges for listings is set to intensify.“Switches are high-profile marketing events for sure and the exchanges work very hard on winning them for branding purposes,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS, “but the number of companies that actually transfer in any year is tiny.”NYSE also chose to play down the significance of listings transfers, emphasising instead its performance in attracting IPOs. The 104 IPOs listed on NYSE in 2011 raised $33bn, more than any other exchange group.“The NYSE is far more than what happens on the trading floor here. The majority of our business is outside the US and we have a thriving futures and derivatives business,” said Scott Cutler head of trading at NYSE.“New listings could fall to zero and it wouldn’t have a material impact on revenue,” he added.

The Nasdaq Composite index trailed, up just 0.8 per cent to 2,646.85.Sectoral moves added to the sense of confusion. The financial sector of the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent, handily outperforming its peers, with those stocks most sensitive to eurozone contagion fears performing best.Morgan Stanley climbed 5.5 per cent to $16.38 for one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and Goldman Sachs was up 4.3 per cent to $101.45.Other cyclical stocks have tended to follow where financials led in recent months but materials and energy stocks were flat.Refiners were hard hit as RBC Capital Markets analysts said the return of light oil from Libya meant complex refiners would no longer be able to charge a premium for processing lower cost oils.Valero fell 6.3 per cent to $21.15. Tesoro suffered most after Edward Westlake, oil analyst at Credit Suisse, told clients: “A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short-term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012.” Its shares fell 11.1 per cent to $21.79.Oilfield services companies also slipped as the Baker Hughes global oil and gas rig count fell for the first time since April when Nato action in Libya disrupted production.Halliburton fell 6.8 per cent to $34.08, not helped by allegations from BP that the company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Noble Corp fell 4.6 per cent to $33.04 and Baker Hughes was off 6 per cent to $50.39.Waqar Syed, Goldman Sachs oil analyst, offered some hope for the sector as he resumed coverage with a positive outlook, predicting fracking of new oil wells in shale fields will increase 18 per cent in 2012.Shares in DuPont fell 4.2 per cent over the week to $45.04 with most of the damage done on Friday when the chemicals group cut 2011 earnings guidance by 10 cents a share to between $3.87 and $3.95.DuPont blamed weak demand as customers run down inventories rather than purchase new products, which knocked rival Dow Chemicals, whose shares fell 2.3 per cent to $27.10.Good news for wireless network provider Clearwire was bad news for investors in its largest customer and principal owner, the mobile network Sprint Nextel.Clearwire said it would raise $350m by issuing new shares at $2 apiece, easing bankruptcy fears. Shares held steady at $2.15. But Sprint shares fell 5 per cent to $2.47, as investors balked at the $300m investment the company must make to maintain its controlling stake in Clearwire.Analysts said Clearwire is even more dependent on Sprint for capital in light of Verizon’s deal to sell products jointly with cable companies Time Warner, Comcast and Bright House.Positive headlines did nothing to stop another bad week for US solar stocks.News that MidAmerican Energy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, had purchased the Topaz solar farm in California from First Solar briefly lifted shares in the solar developer. But analysts poured cold water on the investment.“Let’s be clear, this is not Warren Buffett taking a bet on solar technology,” said Michael Horwitz, solar analyst at Robert W Baird. “This is Warren Buffett investing in a power plant that is guaranteed to yield large cash flows for at least 20 to 25 years,” he added. “The power plant just happens to be solar-powered.”First Solar ended the week down 4.4 per cent to $45.67. Solar panel manufacturer MEMC Electronic Materials climbed 3.3 per cent to $4.42, but analysts were unimpressed after management announced a restructuring that will see it reduce output.
37;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Semiconductors: road trip;The question is whether the latest bad news means the sector has hit bottom;Are we almost there yet, daddy? The grating refrain from family car trips the world over fits the semiconductor industry quite nicely. Profit warnings from semiconductor makers Texas Instruments and Altera were not a big surprise. Trimmed forecasts have been a theme in the industry for months now. The question is whether the latest round of bad news means we have arrived at the bottom, and if a rebound is imminent.Texas Instruments, which makes wireless and industrial chips, and Altera, which is largely focused on communications, expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline about 6 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, compared with the third. (They lowered expectations in the last quarter, too.) The shares of both trailed the market on Friday on a strong day for equities.The two companies indicated that many markets globally looked a bit soft, but that sales performance was undershooting end-market demand as customers brought inventory down. That is a fair enough point, but distributors and manufacturers do not bring inventory down in anticipation of strong business.Altera’s management commented that the current downturn looks a lot like the one in 2008/09, when customers aggressively trimmed their sales heading into the slowdown, but then ordered equally aggressively when things started looking up. (Both Altera and Texas Instruments’ revenues grew 50 per cent year over year in the first quarter of 2010.) Are we headed for a smaller but still significant bounce? MKM Partners points out that while analysts have lowered expectations for the industry and now see flattish sales over the next year, valuations across the sector are not especially low. So for chipmakers to beat expectations, the global economy will have to play along. Like a trip with a carful of kids, that could take a while.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
38;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-12-09T17:35:13Z;DuPont shares fall on profit warning;Chemicals industry often seen as an economic bellwether;Shares in DuPont, one of the world’s biggest chemicals makers, dropped almost 5 per cent after the company warned on profits. It cited weakening demand, particularly for products such as polymers and consumer electronics.The warning, which came a day after Texas Instruments cut its earnings forecast, could fuel fears that earnings growth will slow down next year after several years of strong profit increases for big companies following the recession.The chemicals industry is often seen as an economic bellwether, since its products are used in a wide range of consumer goods, from soap and saucepans to computers and solar panels.DuPont’s warning follows a similar cut in profits outlook by Wacker Chemie, the German chemicals company, as the industry tries to cope with shrinking inventories.“We are seeing slower growth in certain segments during the fourth quarter, driven by global economic uncertainty,” said Ellen Kullman, DuPont’s chief executive. “This uncertainty is contributing to ongoing conservative cash management in some supply chains.”The Delaware-based company said profits for the year would be within a range of $3.87 to $3.95 per share, down from its earlier forecast of $3.97 to $4.05 per share. DuPont had raised the lower end of that estimate in October from $3.90. Analysts, on average, had expected DuPont’s full-year profits to be about $4.03 a share.“The earnings revision reflects destocking across polymers and certain industrial supply chains that has accelerated during the fourth quarter,” said Ms Kullman. “Consumer electronics demand has further softened, and housing and construction markets remain weak.”Not all of DuPont’s businesses are suffering. The company said demand in its agriculture and food unit remains strong, in part due to growth in Latin America.The warning came as a surprise to the markets, as DuPont’s performance until now has been good. Ms Kullman told the FT last year that “the worst is behind us”. The company’s third-quarter earnings were better than expected as DuPont benefited from higher prices, sharp increases in revenues in all of its main business segments and strong sales in emerging markets. However, it also warned when it reported those results in October that its fourth quarter would be hit by slowing global growth.Shares in DuPont were trading down 4.9 per cent at $44.24 by noon in New York.

Asian stocks dropped on growing doubts that European leaders could come up with a convincing plan to resolve the eurozone’s debt crisis at a summit later in the day.The MSCI Asia Pacific index fell 1.1 per cent with Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average down 1.6 per cent, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 off 1.4 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi Composite index 1.9 per cent lower.Hopes for a comprehensive package to stave off a full-blown financial crisis in Europe were dashed on Thursday after Mario Draghi, president of European Central Bank, said that the European Union treaty prohibits “monetary financing.”“The message from ECB president Draghi …could not have been clearer – don’t expect the central bank to save the eurozone with bigger purchases of government bonds or by lending to the IMF,” said John Higgins at Capital Economics.Mr Draghi also said the decision to ease monetary policy was not unanimous, sparking concerns that national rivalries within the ECB could hobble decision-making.Exporters plunged on concerns about the global economic outlook after Japan revised down its third quarter gross domestic product growth to an annualised 5.6 per cent on Friday from an initial 6 per cent. The Bank of Korea also cut the country’s GDP growth rate for this year to 3.8 per cent from its previous estimate of 4.3 per cent.Sony fell 2.1 per cent and Toyota Motor lost 1.4 per cent in Tokyo while Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots, fell 2.8 per cent and Hitachi Construction Machinery shed 2.3 per cent. LG Electronics slid 2.8 per cent in Seoul.Chipmakers lost ground after US chipmakers Texas Instruments and Altera Corp presented weak quarterly outlooks. Hynix Semiconductor dropped 3 per cent and its bigger rival Samsung Electronics lost 1.3 per cent in Seoul while Advantest Corp sank 3.7 per cent in Tokyo.Financial shares were among the leading decliners amid worries about the fallout from Europe’s debt woes.ANZ Bank shed 1.6 per cent and National Australia Bank lost 2.1 per cent in Sydney while Woori Financial Group fell 1.8 per cent in Seoul.

Japan’s oil explorer Inpex declined 2.2 per cent in Tokyo.Investors also focused on key economic data from China. The country’s annual inflation rate fell sharply to 4.2 per cent in November, the lowest level in more than a year, from 5.5 per cent in October, fuelling expectations of further monetary easing to support economic growth.However, the impact of the news was limited with worries about Europe weighing on Chinese shares. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.7 per cent while China’s Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent.Property shares slumped in Hong Kong with Agile Property Holdings off 3.2 per cent and China Overseas Land & Investment down 3.4 per cent.In Sydney, AMP bucked the trend, rising 2.2 per cent after Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group bought a 15 per cent stake in the Australian investment management firm for A$425m.In currency markets, the yen was trading at Y77.67 per dollar from Y77.63 in New York late Thursday. It was at Y103.66 per euro from Y103.59.In commodities markets, spot gold advanced $7.4 to $1,713.20 per troy ounce while January Nymex crude oil futures declined four cents to $98.20 per barrel on Globex.Overnight, the euro slumped as disappointed investors sold the single currency after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi dashed the prospects of more aggressive bond buying by the central bank.Risk assets had rallied earlier right after the ECB announced a 25-basis point interest rate cut and unveiled a range of measures designed to support the eurozone financial system.Global equity markets also shrugged off a bigger than expected fall in US weekly initial jobless claims.The S&P 500 Index closed at its lowest level in two weeks after a three-day rally and the FTSE All-World index was down by 1.9 per cent, reflecting a souring of risk appetite that can be seen across commodities, currencies and bonds, where perceived havens are in demand.News that Standard & Poor’s had placed 15 Spanish banks on watch for downgrade also weighed on the single currency, which traded 0.5 per cent lower at $1.3342 at close in New York. Earlier it touched its lowest level this month but pared some of its losses after a draft for the EU summit was circulated, showing leaders are committed to a new “fiscal compact” for the eurozone.The dollar index was up 0.4 per cent, while US and German bonds are seeing buyers.

Investors can now take a direct “risk on” and “risk off” bet through two recently launched exchange-traded notes.The ETRACS Fisher-Gartman Risk On ETN (ONN) and its Risk Off (OFF) sibling are linked to the performance of the Fisher-Gartman Risk index. They comprise a mix of long and short positions in assets highly correlated to changes in market mood.So, for example, the ONN’s two biggest weightings are long the DJ-UBS crude oil index and short US 10-year bond futures. The OFF takes the opposite positions.The ETNs are thus handy for those more strategically challenged large investors and their smaller peers seeking a one-stop sentiment punt.But critics note a potential problem with such indices is that the components’ relationship to the “risk” mood can change over time.Indeed, gold has not been included in the two ETNs because, the originators admit, they don’t know whether the bullion is an “on” or “off” vehicle.And pinpointing the source of risk shifts can allow for other simple trades. Note how closely the euro has tracked the FGRI.……Reporting by Song Junga-a in Seoul, Vivianne Rodrigues and Telis Demos in New York.

40;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-11-16T22:43:30Z;Infineon: the chips are down;After many twists, the German chipmaker may finally be sorting itself out;Is it a miracle or a mirage? Infineon, the European chipmaker, may finally be sorting itself out. As if technology company profits were not volatile enough over the past few years, the German company has added its own twists – haphazard strategy and corporate governance disputes. The result is that its shares have returned a negative 26 per cent over five years. So there is a job to do. Wednesday’s news of a 70 per cent jump in net income for 2011, to just over €1bn, suggests it is under way. But investors will be wondering how chief executive Peter Bauer intends to spend Infineon’s most eye-catching asset – its €2.4bn of net cash.He gave little away with the results. Infineon resumed dividend payments in 2010, and promises a further pay-out this year, and it spent a further €200m on buying back shares and convertible bonds in 2011. With the shares off 15 per cent this year, Mr Bauer may be tempted to buy back more shares. Or he could go on the acquisition trail. He plays that down, at least in the short term while overcapacity and the global economic slowdown cause havoc with revenue and earnings forecasts. Given that Infineon itself expects a “weak year” for semiconductors in 2012, hoarding cash is not a bad tactic in uncertain economic times. For tech companies, it is better than being leveraged.The longer it sits on its hands, however, the more tempting a target Infineon becomes for bigger rivals. The sale of its wireless chip unit to Intel last year for $1.4bn may be a sign that other bits of the company are for sale. A shake-out in the chip market might be on the cards when the industry downturn bottoms out, but not perhaps until 2013. Infineon’s shares trade on a forward earnings multiple of 13 times – roughly similar to rivals STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments. In a cyclical downturn, though, that may be too high an entry point for a bidder.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
41;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-11-07T21:40:41Z;Semi-stocks weigh on Nasdaq;Investors cautious on Greece and Italy news;Semiconductor stocks slipped on Monday, as supply chain disruption stemming from flooding in Thailand continued to weigh on the sector.Hard drive manufacturers have had to close factories in Thailand, raising fears that products such as personal computers, set top boxes and servers will all face production shortfalls next year.Texas Instruments was off 0.8 per cent to $31.53, and Nvidia was off 0.5 per cent to $14.74.Analysts said falling semi stocks could also indicate renewed concern about global growth, because chips are used in a wide variety of industrial processes and computer products.“We’re definitely seeing the impact of macro headwinds in this space,” said Kevin Cassidy, semiconductor analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“Looking at third-quarter results, industry wide guidance for the fourth quarter was down 10 per cent, and the numbers for 2012 have been set very low,” he added.

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
43;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-10-21T09:54:56Z;Investors kept at an Arm’s length from chip group;;At a time not notable for its corporate cheer, it is cockle-warming to reflect on one big British success story, Arm Holdings.The Cambridge-based chip group this week unveiled a microchip design that, it says, may mean that, in a couple of years’ time, smartphones could cost less than $100. With the new design, a phone would switch between a more powerful chip for complex tasks – like running Microsoft’s Windows operating system – and a tiny, efficient chip for simpler ones. Arm believes that not only will phones be cheaper, but they will have longer battery life. Samsung, Texas Instruments and LG have already signed up to use the new Arm design.The innovation puts Arm, again, well ahead of rivals like Intel which are keen to eat into its dominance of this market. Chips designed by Arm already feature in more than 90 per cent of the world’s mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhones – and its iPads.Sadly, investors cannot really take advantage of this impressive story. Arm’s shares have risen more than 50 per cent over the past year, and trade at more than 50 times the company’s estimated 2012 earnings. This is partly a reflection of the gloom shrouding the prospects of most of the equity market. Arm’s p/e is nearly double that of the next most highly valued stock in the FTSE 100. But it is also a sign of the persistent takeover rumours swirling around the company. These have been fuelled by Hewlett-Packard’s recent purchase of another successful British tech company, Autonomy. The deal was controversial, and was an important factor behind the ousting of HP’s former chief executive, Léo Apotheker. But the price – for the sellers – was delightful – £6.7bn, or a near 80 per cent premium to the company’s pre-offer price.One often mooted buyer for Arm is Apple, which this week unveiled its first results of the post-Steve Jobs era. Apple’s cash pile, at $81bn, means that buying Arm – with a market capitalisation of a mere £7.5bn – would be a drop in the ocean.However, Apple has been sitting on its cash for many a long year, and Arm’s investors should be wary of pinning their hopes on a buyer from across the ocean. Instead they should reflect that, when shares trade at ludicrous levels, even the tiniest stumble can mean a sharp loss in value.Apple is a case in point. Its third-quarter revenue rose 40 per cent year-on-year and net income was up 50 per cent. Yet, mainly due to exaggerated expectations of even stronger iPhone sales, investors sent the shares down 6 per cent. Arm’s shareholders should take note.
44;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-10-19T18:21:56Z;Arm eyes $100 smartphone with chip design;;Arm Holdings has unveiled a microchip design that could allow the development of smartphones costing less than $100 by 2013.The UK-based company unveiled a microprocessor design that is one-fifth the size of those used in smartphones today, and five times more efficient.“The sub-$100 price point is when we can start to talk about connecting the next billion people to internet content and services over mobile devices,” said Warren East, chief executive.The new Cortex A7 processor will also help Arm maintain its dominance in the mobile phone and tablet market, where it is increasingly being challenged by Intel. Known for its extremely small and power-efficient processors, Arm’s designs are used in Apple’s popular iPhone and iPad devices.Intel, which dominates the market for chips used in personal computers and servers, is keen also to supply mobile device makers like Apple. The US company has invested heavily in improving the power-use of its microprocessors, and this year announced a new 3D-structure for chips which would make them run faster while not consuming as much power.Although the 3D chips are still some way from production, Arm has been under pressure to show that it can keep innovating as fast as its much larger rival.The new A7 processor, which is expected to be in devices within two years, could help solve the problem of short battery life experienced by users of high-end smartphones.Arm has developed a system in which the small and efficient A7 processor can be combined with a bigger Cortex A15 processor powerful enough to be used in a computer server or to run Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system. A phone or tablet device using this kind of “Big.Little” processor seamlessly switches between the powerful chip for complex tasks and the tiny, efficient chip for simpler ones. Arm estimated that devices would have 70 per cent longer battery life using this system.“Battery consumption is an important factor with the use of smartphones, especially with the exponential growth of data use that we are seeing today,” said Von McConnell, director of innovation and advanced labs at Sprint, the US mobile telecoms provider.A number of chipmakers, including Broadcom, Samsung, Texas Instruments and LG are already planning to use the new Arm design in their products.
45;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-10-05T02:10:28Z;Technology only partly explains demise of Kodak;;From Prof Charles McMillan.Sir, The idea that disruptive technology explains the demise of Kodak (Tony Jackson, October 3) is, at best, limited. Like the Detroit car companies, Kodak’s problems were not sudden, nor limited to film as a chemical process (ignoring price/cost issues) rather than digital. Clearly, Japanese consumer electronic companies were pioneering digital technologies from the 1970s. The (then) six camera companies excelled at more than film or digital technologies, incorporating innovations in lens technology and shutters, but also simple ways to load the film, learning from Sony and Panasonic about cartridge technology. Fuji, with its alliance partner, Xerox, taught the US company about quality management in manufacturing, while the camera (and TV) companies like Sony pioneered incredible resolution of pictures and images – the core technology of Xerox. Canon, not only a camera maker (and founded by a medical doctor), pioneered medical imaging for X-ray, a field also cultivated by Kodak.Yet Kodak assumed that it owned the US camera market. But when the Olympics were held in Los Angeles in 1984, Fuji, not Kodak, became the sponsor. (Fuji also bought out Xerox in Japan.) That was the signal that Fuji was taking on Kodak frontally in the US market. Kodak, typical of too many companies, appealed to government for protection and filed law suits, claiming that Japan was a closed market, despite the presence of very successful American companies such as IBM and Texas Instruments in Japan. An alternative Kodak strategy, promoted by James Abegglen at Boston Consulting, was to have Kodak invest directly in Japan, in order to prevent Fuji and the Japanese camera makers from building huge market share both at home and in the growing Asian market, and thus building up cash reserves to expand in the US market. Kodak lost the court cases, the US government stood hapless, and Kodak sold its medical imaging division to Canada’s Onex Corporation, which merged it with a company in Israel.Unlike in medicine, where pathology is so central to learning about disease, business school academics and the media too often ignore the pathologies of bad management, poor corporate governance, and the failure to play the global game. Technology – new, disruptive or re-engineered – only goes so far in explaining the success or failure of companies.Charles McMillan, Schulich School of Business, Toronto, ON, Canada
46;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-10-03T16:43:58Z;Semiconductors’ bell;Revenue expectations are trimmed;In the debate about the world economy’s degree of shabbiness (utterly dreadful or just dreary?), any firm data points are welcome. Semiconductor companies, therefore, may provide some much-needed help. Processors and memory chips go mostly into computers, but other flavours of semiconductors are used all across the global economy. For example, analysis by MKM Partners finds that semiconductor company revenues have a very high long-term correlation with America’s gross domestic product. In addition, semi revenues have accounted for a stable portion of global output (about half a per cent) for the last 15 years, if the 2000 technology bubble is excluded.Unfortunately, recent news from the semiconductor industry has been pretty bad. In September, five big companies that sell to a variety of global industries – Texas Instruments, Freescale, Altera, Xilinx, Cavium and Integrated Device Technology – pre-announced cuts to revenue expectations for the upcoming quarter. Most of the five expect their top lines to decline in a range from about mid-single digits to 10 per cent. Memory-chip maker Micron met sales targets but weak pricing pinched margins.Investors have responded by selling semiconductor company shares. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index hit its highest level since 2007 in February. Since then it has come down by more than a quarter, while the broader market has dropped 15 per cent.Nor might this underperformance be at an end. Analysts’ revenue expectations for the upcoming quarter have been trimmed, thanks to the pre-announcements. But the numbers for many of the biggest companies for this year and next still imply fairly solid growth – and that is on top of a strong base set last year. MKM’s analysis suggests that 2012 and 2013 industry forecasts may too high by as much as one fifth. Barring a dramatic change in fortunes, semiconductor stocks may continue to hold a mirror to a global economy that is getting uglier.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
47;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-08-03T18:08:31Z;Bears take aim at Wall St’s two-year bull run;Bruising summer has placed the index on cusp of a breakdown;"There is little cheer on Wall Street. A bruising summer has placed the benchmark S&P 500 index on the cusp of a breakdown that could imperil an impressive bull run that began more than two years ago.The world’s most followed equity index briefly tumbled into negative territory for the year this week. Ominously, it sits below its 200-day moving average and has been testing a bullish trend line that dates back to the market’s nadir in March 2009. These moves come after the market has dropped for each of the past three months. A modest rebound on Wednesday left the S&P down 7.6 per cent at 1,260.34 since the bull run peaked at 1,363.61 at the end of April.Any relief that the US has avoided a debt default has been wiped out by a string of economic reports that cast doubt over a second half economic rebound.Bullish investors, who backed the recovery, are now searching for glimmers of positive news in the hope this will stabilise the market and confirm this week’s sell-off as a temporary dip.For many, the monthly jobs number for July, due on Friday, now looms as a critical event. Further evidence of economic weakness could push the S&P down towards the 1,200 level.“We need a catalyst to change the mindset of investors and a good piece of data would help enormously,” says Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.For the undaunted, the recent weakness is only making stocks look more attractive on a long term horizon. Based on conservative projections for 2011, the S&P p/e ratio is below 13 times, a historically attractive valuation. Dividend yields for many strong companies compare favourably with the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.58 per cent.“Earnings are still robust and valuations are not rich, we don’t think the economy is heading into the tank,” says Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “There is just a lot of nervousness and we have a stock market that is stepping back and recalibrating expectations of lower economic growth.”That growing nervousness has pushed investors to look past solid second-quarter earnings to the impact of a deepening crisis in the eurozone and a possible “double-dip” in the US. The attractive valuations on stocks may simply be pricing in the realistic prospect of a halt to the recovery, or worse.“The problem with strong earnings coupled with a weak economy is that investors tend to be less willing to pay up for those earnings,” says Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo. “That could keep valuations low.”Companies have compounded the gloom, some lowering guidance for future earnings and others not providing it as they have become less confident about the third quarter. Out of the 360 companies that have reported second-quarter results, 76 have provided guidance for the next quarter, with 51, or 67 per cent, lowering their outlooks, says John Butters, senior equity analyst at FactSet.Notable examples of companies dropping their third-quarter earnings estimates include Tyco International, Illinois Tool Works, Netflix and Texas Instruments.And, as earnings become more difficult to forecast, investors are placing lower value on future income prospects, which translates into a lower multiple on current earnings.Over the course of the second quarter, analysts cut their third-quarter earnings forecasts for six out of the 10 S&P sectors, led by materials and financials.“The press releases have been overwhelmingly bullish, but the lack of quantitative guidance suggests to me that companies are reluctant to commit to exact expectations in an uncertain economic environment,” says Christine Short, senior manager at S&P Valuation Risk.Adam Parker, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, says: “We expect earnings per share growth in coming years to be more volatile and lower than historical norms, both of which are negative for the multiple.” He has lowered his base case scenario for the p/e multiple on the S&P 500 by the end of 2011 to just 12 times earnings, from the 13.5 times multiple seen last year.Healthcare is among the sector hardest hit, down 8 per cent in the past three months.Technology shares have shown relative resilience, falling 3.5 per cent in the past three months.“Our defensive sectors include technology, or what we call ‘tech staples’,” says Nicholas Bohnsack, strategist at Strategas. “Microsoft is a prime example, as it has a diversified, multi-
billion dollar product portfolio that does not ebb and flow as the market does.”The uncertainty in the market comes as many investors have moved to the sidelines, choosing to stockpile cash.“People are looking at whether they should catch a falling knife or wait for the market to turn,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Mr Sarni says: “I view this more in the camp of a buying opportunity. You have three choices at any given time: you can buy, sell or hold . . . We are buyers as what we are seeing is volatility along the way to a long drawn out recovery.”"
48;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-07-27T14:32:17Z;Tech supply chain faces excess inventory;;Fears of shortages in the global technology supply chain are turning into worries about excess inventory as precautionary stockpiling after the Japan earthquake has coincided with waning consumer demand in Europe and the US.Far from the doomsday scenarios in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that there would be shortages – thereby making components pricier and delaying production – the biggest problem now facing global technology manufacturers is how to clear overstocked warehouses.“Nothing is tight right now [in the PC supply chain],” says Jenny Lai, head of Taiwan research at HSBC.“Those components where there was a risk of shortage are now having the biggest problems [in terms of oversupply].”Global semiconductor inventory levels – a good indicator of the health of the overall technology supply chain because all electronic devices use chips – jumped 10 per cent, from 66 days in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 73 days at the end of the first quarter this year, estimates Credit Suisse. It was the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis that these inventory levels rose above the long-term rolling historical average.The fact that potential shortages arising from the Japan disaster in March have been so quickly addressed is testament to the flexibility and diversity of the global supply chain. Companies moved quickly to secure alternative sources for key components, and the absence of widespread rolling power cuts in Japan beyond specific quake-affected areas meant further disruptions were avoided.Unfortunately for manufacturers, the move to ensure sufficient supplies coincided with generally weak consumer spending, particularly in Europe and the US, which are still the industry’s biggest markets.Acer, the world’s third-biggest PC company by sales, in June wrote off $150m worth of inventory in Europe, where the consumer PC market has been particularly damped by macroeconomic concerns.Nanya, Taiwan’s biggest manufacturer by sales of D-Ram memory chips for PCs, said last week that its inventory levels were now double the normal two to three weeks’ worth of stock.Oversupply concerns also plague the flat panel industry. AU Optronics, the world’s third-biggest flat-panel producer by sales, is cutting this year’s capital expenditure by a third due to “highly uncertain levels of demand in the third quarter” for televisions and computers. “The most important thing for us to do now is to control our inventory levels,” says Paul Peng, executive vice-president at AUO.STMicroelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, also said it had been affected by overstocking. “We saw overbooking by some customers in April, as they tried to protect themselves from shortages of certain components. That led to a correction in June,” said Carlo Bozotti, chief executive.US semiconductor suppliers generally show a healthier position– Intel said last week that inventories were at healthy levels, while Qualcomm said levels for CDMA phone chips had declined a little in the last quarter and were heading for the low end of the historical 15-20 week range of supplies.But Texas Instruments, whose factories were damaged during the Japan earthquake, on Monday said it had purposely increased inventories in its last quarter.Companies along the supply chain building up stock – both after the financial crisis and the Japan quake – helped drive the growth of semiconductor groups in the past two years. But with inventory levels now approaching historic highs, many chipmakers risk having to take writedowns if demand remains weak in the second half of the year.“When the supply chain goes from restocking to destocking, it slows down growth for a couple of quarters,” says Randy Abrams, analyst at Credit Suisse.Prices of memory chips like D-Ram and Flash spiked briefly after the quake on concerns of short supply but sluggish PC sales meant that provided little respite in an environment in which D-Ram prices have fallen by 70 per cent since May 2010.Unlike in previous years, “no one [among Nanya’s customers] is increasing inventory for the ‘back to school’ sales season,” says Pai Pei-lin, Nanya vice-president. “Stocks of key components in the supply chain are just too high right now.”Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London and Chris Nuttall in San Francisco.

Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.
50;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-07-26T10:49:05Z;STMicro hit by falling sales at Nokia;;Shares in STMicroelectronics fell more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after Europe’s largest chipmaker by revenues warned of lower sales in the third quarter, due to difficulties at Nokia, one of its biggest customers.The Franco-Italian company said its wireless business, a key supplier of semiconductors used in Nokia phones, saw sales decline by 34 per cent to $347m in the second quarter, as demand for Nokia handsets fell faster than expected.Losses at the wireless unit widened by 51 per cent to $207m.Carlo Bozotti, chief executive, said sales at STMicro overall could fall as much as 5 per cent in the third quarter as the wireless chip business, which come mainly from ST Ericsson, its joint venture with the Swedish telecoms equipment company, continued to drag on performance. Analysts had been expecting an uplift of about 4 per cent in what is usually a strong three months for sales.STMicro shares fell €0.69 to €5.71, their biggest daily fall in a decade.Mr Bozotti said there had been a “significant reduction in the demand outlook from a major customer”, which had “made the guidance lower than we expected”.Nokia’s handset shipments declined 34 per cent in the second quarter, and the company was overtaken by Apple in smartphone sales. Nokia is estimated to account for about 30 per cent of ST Ericsson’s sales.“The poor results at ST Ericsson were not a surprise after the warnings from Nokia and Texas Instruments. But the outlook they gave was dire,” said Adrien Bommelaer, analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital.Mr Bozotti said the company had cut production at several factories as demand fell. Although no permanent job losses were planned, Mr Bozotti said the company was cutting back on temporary staff.The troubles at the wireless business mask an otherwise strong quarter for the company, in which sales of chips to car manufacturers, for example, rose 28 per cent. Carmakers use the semiconductors for functions such as transmission and power steering, and demand for more cars in emerging markets such as China is fuelling growth.Overall sales at STMicro were up 1.3 per cent at $2.57bn, in line with expectations. Stripping out ST Ericsson, growth would have been 17 per cent.Net income was at $420m, up nearly 18 per cent. The rise reflected a $357m payment from Credit Suisse, the final part of a settlement the bank was in 2009 forced to pay, after it was sued for mishandling STMicro’s investments. Diluted earnings per share were 46 cents.Mr Bozotti said he remained committed to the ST Ericsson joint venture, and was confident the business would begin to recover by the end of the year.ST Ericsson has started producing chips that handle high-speed internet connections for smartphones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 Android phone.Mr Bozotti said the company was making an effort to get the chips into more Android handsets. It has trials with seven of the nine largest handset manufacturers.“We are keen to go faster,” he said. “There will be some material results in the last quarter and a significant turnaround next year.”

52;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Texas Instruments guidance disappoints;;Texas Instruments sounded a warning for the holiday season as it reported lacklustre activity from manufacturers in computing and consumer electronics, including TVs and gaming machines.The Dallas-based chipmaker issued third-quarter forecasts of $3.55bn in revenues and earnings per share of 60 cents – below Wall Street analysts’ expectations of $3.64bn and 66 cents respectively.“We note that production at some computing and consumer manufacturers appears lukewarm even though we’re heading into the back-to-school and holiday seasons,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive.The Japan earthquake damaged its factories, but the company said it had resumed production ahead of schedule.TI delivered slightly better than expected second-quarter numbers of $3.46bn in revenues and 56 cents a share in profits, compared with analysts’ forecasts of $3.44bn and 54 cents.TI said its $6.5bn all-cash acquisition of National Semiconductor announced in April had cleared all antitrust reviews except China’s, and the deal was expected to close before the end of the year.Intel, the chipmaker, also reported softness in mature consumer markets during its earnings call last week.
53;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-07-25T21:10:16Z;Debt ceiling impasse pushes US stocks lower;;Wall Street weakened on Monday amid uncertainty over whether an agreement to raise the US federal debt ceiling would be reached, bringing nearer the possibility of a default by the US Treasury.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,337.43, ending a choppy session that hung on the pronouncements of US lawmakers. Nine of the S&P’s 10 major sectors declined, the softest being telecoms services, down 1.4 per cent, and healthcare, down 1.1 per cent. Utilities, a defensive sector, rose 0.3 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,842.80, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,592.80.Investors are waiting to see whether Congress can dissolve partisan deadlock and raise the $14,300bn debt ceiling and avoid potential default before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.Republicans and Democrats announced rival plans to increase the US borrowing cap.John Boehner, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, proposed raising the ceiling in two steps.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, announced a separate measure to raise the debt limit by $2,400bn in a single move.Anthony Conroy, managing director at Convergex, said: “When Congress fails to agree, it’s certainly not viewed as positive. Any uncertainty is creating volatility, and we’re witnessing that volatility today.”The Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, rose 11 per cent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “It still appears very unlikely that the US will actually default, since the political cost of being seen as the group which triggered one could be very high,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.“If there is a deal, even if it limits the growth in Treasury issuance over the next few years, it could remove the roadblock of budget uncertainty from both the economy and markets, an eventuality that should prove stock-positive and bond negative,” he added.The second-quarter earnings season was being overshadowed by the debt ceiling impasse.“We don’t have much in terms of economic news, so the focus is on what is not happening with getting the debt ceiling lifted,” said Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think there’s still juice in this market if they get a deal done.”Lorillard, the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands, fell 4.5 per cent to $107.29 despite reporting quarterly net profit that beat expectations. Analysts speculated that the shares were hit by investors taking profits since the stock had gained 37 per cent this year.Shares in Kimberly-Clarkfell 2.1 per cent to $66.48 after earnings dropped 1.8 per cent as higher costs weighed on the manufacturer of Kleenex tissues. The company also warned that its 2011 earnings could arrive near the lower end of its forecast.Eaton, a US manufacturer, gained 2.8 per cent to $52.59 after beating profit estimates, citing fresh demand for electrical systems and a strengthening truck market.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, reported second-quarter profits that beat forecasts.“The structural improvement in the underlying operations at [Baker Hughes] is no longer a secret to investors, but we expect that [second-quarter] results should help solidify recent improvement in investor sentiment towards the name,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The stock rose 0.1 per cent to $79.94.A handful of downstream oil companies were also strong. Marathon Petroleum rose 2 per cent to $41.37 after investment bank Dahlman Rose rated the stock a buy.

54;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-05-10T03:36:35Z;Nvidia’s ace of base;;Nvidia’s acquisition of Icera on Monday for $367m completes the chipmaker’s transition from a PC-focused graphics chipmaker to one built to challenge in the post-PC world that Apple likes to talk about so much.It also deals another blow to Texas Instruments, once the leading wireless chipmaker but now one that prefers to emphasise its strength in analogue chips.Analysts point out that TI was a customer of the UK’s Icera for the baseband chips that process communications functions in phones and is now one of the only companies left that has an applications processor business without any internal baseband support, Nokia being another.“While Icera claims that it will continue working with existing partners, this definitely creates a problem for TI, which exited the baseband business in the 2009/2010 timeframe,” says Jim McGregor, chief technology strategist at the in-Stat research firm, in a report.“Not only does this eliminate one of the potential independent baseband partners, it makes partnering with the remaining suppliers more difficult.”Icera was the only remaining independent supplier with a solution that supported both 3G and 4G standards, he explains.He points out that Nvidia’s Tegra 2 application processor lacks an integrated baseband chip that would allow it to compete better in smartphones, where the main player Qualcomm has its Snapdragon applications processor well integrated with its own wireless chips.With Intel completing its $1.4bn purchase of Infineon’s wireless division in January to add its baseband chips, the competitive landscape has changed significantly this year.Nvidia’s dual-core Tegra 2 has been out in front in tablets – it is in the Motorola Xoom, LG Optimus Pad, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Sony’s upcoming S1 and S2 tablets, to name just a few.It is less well represented in smartphones, but features in “super phones” such as the LG Optimus 2X and Motorola Atrix 4G.With Nvidia due to move to quad-core Arm-based chips well ahead of the competition, the addition of Icera’s technology will make it a formidable competitor in tablets, smartphones and new growth segments such as in-car systems.
55;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-05-04T18:27:11Z;Applied: will takeover spark innovation?;The crucial question is whether new and better products result from Varian deal;Talk is cheap. Earnings accretion is free. US tech companies have heaps of zero-yielding cash and access to cheap debt. Given this, any company that acquires a profitable competitor, but fails to show a bump in earnings per share, needs to fire its chief financial officer.On Wednesday, semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials announced an agreed purchase of Varian Semiconductor. It is paying up. The premium is 40 per cent above Varian’s 30-day average undisturbed price. Applied trades at a price-to-prospective earnings ratio of 10 times and is paying 16 times for Varian. Nonetheless, Applied expects 8 per cent earnings per share accretion in the first year. Certainly, Varian is a high-quality asset. It controls three-quarters of a sub-segment that is growing ahead of the industry, and where Applied no longer participates – partly because Applied had been outflanked by Varian in that niche.Still, Applied sees $1.7bn of value in Varian that the market didn’t. It is pencilling in $50m-$60m in immediate annual cost cuts, but whichever way you tax and capitalise that – and even if you expect savings to grow from there – investors are not getting to $1.7bn.Might revenue synergies make up the difference? In the Texas Instruments-National Semiconductor deal announced in April, the promised top-line jump is to come mostly from pushing the target’s products through the buyer’s massive salesforce. That could work for analogue semiconductors, but semiconductor capital equipment sales are technology rather than salesforce driven. So the crucial question is whether combining the technologies and engineers of Applied and Varian will lead to new and better products.Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, the number of people who can predict whether the combination will spark innovation is very small.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
56;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-27T13:16:26Z;Chip companies warn on Japan effect;;Some of Europe’s largest semiconductor companies on Wednesday warned that disruption following the Japanese earthquake would mean lower growth for the global chip sector this year.“We had predicted growth of around 5 to 8 per cent for the sector but I expect it will be less than this due to Japan,” said Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest chip company.Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer whose products help power smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone, said it was still difficult to estimate the extent of the disruption.“Value chains are so complicated, it is hard to tell where the impact will be. Our customers might make a product that needs a screw from a Japanese factory which is experiencing production problems, and because of that the whole product may be put on hold,” said Warren East, chief executive of Arm.Mr East said supply chain problems could dent royalty revenues by up to 10 per cent in the third quarter.Earlier this month, Texas Instruments warned the earthquake would hit its second-quarter results.The impact of the March 11 earthquake was not yet reflected in first-quarter results, with STMicro reporting a 9 per cent increase in sales to $2.53bn in the three months to April 2.Net profit tripled to $170m from $57m as demand increased for STMicro’s chips for cars and the miniature gyroscopes they make for smartphones such as the Apple iPhone.The only drag on results was the ST Ericsson joint venture, which makes chips mainly for simpler, so-called “feature phones”. Demand for these older-style mobile handsets has fallen faster than expected, leaving STMicro’s wireless revenues down 34 per cent from the same quarter last year. A transition to making chips for popular smartphones will not be felt in results until the end of the year.Earnings per share were $0.19 compared with $0.06 in the same quarter a year ago.Arm Holdings, meanwhile, saw first-quarter sales increase 26 per cent to $116m on strong demand for smartphones and tablets. The company, which provides technology for over 90 per cent of all the world’s mobile phones is now hoping to create a similar position of dominance in set-top boxes and digital television, after winning deals with a number of key suppliers to the sector.Earnings per share were up 34 per cent at 2.73p.Wolfson Microelectronics, the audio chipmaker, meanwhile announced a 44 per cent revenue rise for the first quarter, on increased demand for its products from mobile phone makers.However, It reported a pre-tax loss of $3.5m, compared with $6.9m in the first quarter of 2010. The company has struggled to turn a profit since it lost a contract to supply Apple’s iPhone in 2008.Shares in Arm, which have more than doubled over the last year, fell 1 per cent to 619p in early trading on Wednesday. Wolfson shares rose more than 6 per cent to 231.5p while shares in STMicro fell more than 3 per cent to €8.16.
57;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
58;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-24T16:13:22Z;Emerging markets boost US chip industry;;The US chip industry is looking forward to a strong second half of the year after shaking off the effects of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, weak economic conditions and gloomy analyst predictions.The tablet segment is not cannibalising the PC market to the extent many feared, while increased corporate buying and the strength of demand in emerging markets have been highlighted by semiconductor companies reporting earnings in the past week.“Emerging markets are now over 50 per cent of unit volume,” said Tom Kilroy, head of sales at Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.“That’s kind of off the radar screen for a lot of analysts.”IDC and Gartner, the research groups, this month reported a decline in PC sales in the first quarter and predicted growth this year of 6 and 11 per cent respectively. But Intel expects 13-15 per cent growth, with more than 400m PCs sold worldwide. It says the research groups are missing a lot of sales by local manufacturers and lesser known brands in emerging markets.Intel reported first-quarter sales and made second-quarter forecasts well ahead of Wall Street estimates last week, while rival AMD also reported “great traction” in emerging markets and this “white box” arena.Consumer demand in the US and Europe, where economic conditions are still difficult, was reported to have been “soft” by Intel and AMD as the public opted for tablet devices or delayed purchases. However, other mature markets, such as Australia and Korea, were seeing strong PC sales, as were China and Brazil, the number two and three markets for PC sales this year.Emerging markets are maturing to the extent that higher priced PCs, smartphones and tablets are selling well.“There were concerns when we moved towards emerging markets, but people there are buying higher-end devices,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, in a Financial Times interview after the leading mobile phone chipmaker raised its forecast for average selling prices for phones this year by $9 to $199-$209.Corporate purchases are also helping the industry. Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, said the prospects looked good for sales of PCs – combining its latest processors and Windows 7 – in the second and third quarters. He said a replacement cycle was under way with 75 per cent of enterprise PCs still running two-generations-old Windows XP.The effect of the disaster in Japan on consumer demand and the supply chain for PCs and mobile devices appeared to have been slight, according to Intel and Qualcomm, with little impact on sales and no effect on supplies.
59;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-22T09:10:24Z;Asian tech gains ease China rate concerns;;A strong weekly performance for Asian stocks came courtesy of the region’s technology sector following robust earnings reports from several US tech bellwethers.Asian indices lost ground on Monday and Tuesday before fighting back over the remaining sessions of the week. Monday’s losses followed China’s decision to raise the reserve requirements for its banks to help tackle inflation, while Tuesday’s decline was the result of a warning by Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, on its long-term outlook for US debt.Semiconductor stocks received conflicting messages from the US this week. Texas Instruments reported a downbeat outlook on Monday after the US close, while a day later market bellwether Intel reported forecast-beating first-quarter results.Over the week, Asian chip stocks were broadly higher. South Korea’s Hynix Semiconductor gained 7.2 per cent over the five sessions to Won36,600, while domestic rival Samsung Electronics climbed 1.8 per cent to Won904,000. Although it announced it was to sell its hard-disk drive business to Seagate Technology of the US, Samsung’s performance was hampered by an acrimonious exchange of patent lawsuits with Apple, its largest client.In Japan, Toshiba added 6.2 per cent to Y428 and chip testing company Advantest added 1.4 per cent to Y1484. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co gained 2.5 per cent to T$70.90.LG Display climbed 11.5 per cent over the week to Won40,450 in spite of posting its second-successive quarterly loss. The LCD screen maker, however, said panel shipments in the second-quarter would rise by a late teen percentage from its first-quarter performance.But not all technology groups were supported. In Taiwan, computer manufacturer Acer fell 7.4 per cent to T$51.10, having hit its lowest level in more than two years, after reporting a 10 per cent decline in second-quarter shipments.TDK, the maker of electronic components, shed 8.9 per cent to Y4070 after Goldman Sachs cut its target price, citing the potential loss of business revenues if Samsung were to sell its hard disk drive operations to Seagate.

related charges. J&J was hit by $271m of charges related to its DePuy ASR, a hip replacement which had to be recalled. The stock had been losing ground since the start of the year, but after Tuesday’s gains is up 1.4 per cent year to date.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 2.4 per cent to $34.10, helped by the strong results, while the wider S&P healthcare index was up 0.9 per cent.This helped the wider markets bounce higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing 0.6 per cent higher at 1,312.62. This followed a 1.1 per cent loss in the previous session after S&P, the rating agency, surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by news that housing starts and permits for future home construction had risen by more than expected in March, rising 7.2 per cent from the previous month to 549,000.But the improvement was largely a bounce back from the sharply lower levels in February when the figure was depressed by the winter weather, and so did not have a profound impact in the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 12,266.75 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 2,744.97. “The market did react positively to some good earnings, but the gains were not dramatic as traders are in a cautious mood at the moment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The markets will likely stay in a tight 3-4 per cent trading range for the time being,” he added.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs reported profits down 72 per cent in the first quarter as the bank’s trading revenue declined and earnings were hit by a $1.64bn dividend payment to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.These results were better than analysts’ had expected, but shares in the investment bank still lost 1.3 per cent to $151.86.This weighed many financial stocks, but failed to drag down the overall sector.

This was below Wall Street expectations of profits of 58 cents a share on revenues of $3.40bn. TI shares fell 2.4 per cent to $33.95 in New York in after-hours trading.TI said both the quake and weaker demand for its wireless baseband chips used in mobile phones had hit sales, although new orders were strong.“We expect growth in the second quarter, though it will be pressured by the situation in Japan,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive. “Provided consumer and enterprise demand remain strong, we expect a good second half of the year.”TI earlier this month announced its biggest acquisition in more than a decade, a $6.5bn all-cash deal for Silicon Valley’s National Semiconductor.The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, reports first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and Advanced Micro Devices on Thursday.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 2.3 per cent on the news.The wider technology sector was stirred by news that Nasdaq OMX Group was planning to rebalance the weightings on its Nasdaq 100 index for the first time since 1998.Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems were all up after it was announced that their weightings on the Nasdaq 100 would more than double when the changes come into effect on March 2.Microsoft advanced 0.9 per cent to $25.78 while Intel was up 1.1 per cent to $19.71 as fund managers buying the Nasdaq 100 will now have to increase their position in these companies. Cisco Systems, the network equipment maker, 0.9 per cent to $17.22.The biggest loser from the rebalancing was Apple, which will see its weighting in the index decline from more than 20 per cent to just over 12 per cent. It lost 0.7 per cent to $338.89.Elsewhere in the sector, Google was down 3.2 per cent to $569.09 after reports from Bloomberg that the US Federal Trade Commission is considering launching an antitrust investigation into the company’s dominance of the internet search industry. Overall, the S&P technology index was down 0.1 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was flat at 1,332.63, falling back from slight gains earlier in the session after the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released.The minutes held no surprises, but it did show that the Federal Reserve will not taper off its current $600bn round of asset purchases as they come to an end in June, but just bring the programme to a halt.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than 0.1 per cent to 12,393.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent to 2,791.19.Sentiment in the wider markets was not helped by news that the US service sector has grown by less than expected in March, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing activity.The index showed a reading of 57.3, down from 59.7 in February and short of the 59.5 expected. However, a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector so the news was not terrible.Traders were also waiting apprehensively for the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the 6.4 per cent losses sustained following the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The index is still 0.8 per cent down from the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.The recent gains have occurred in very low volume trading, as some investors have decided to wait on the sidelines for geopolitical tensions to recede.March saw the lightest trading volumes on S&P 500 stocks since December 1999, according to data from LPL Financial Research.On Tuesday, the materials sector saw the strongest gains, with investors shaking off news that China had raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, advanced 1.5 per cent to $56.61 while AK Steel added 3.6 per cent to $16.54. The S&P materials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Shares in Procter & Gamble were in focus after the world’s largest consumer goods company made its final exit from the food sector, selling its Pringles potato chip business to Diamond Foods for $2.35bn.The move sent shares in P&G down 1 per cent to $61.67, but shares in Diamond Foods rose 6.7 per cent to $61.06.Homebuilders lost ground after KB Home reported a 25 per cent decline in revenue in the first quarter.

65;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-05T19:16:20Z;Small caps: Porvair advances after good start to year;Sales and profits ahead of management expectations;Shares in Porvair rallied on Tuesday after the specialist filtration and environmental technology group said it had made a good start to the year and sales and profits were ahead of management expectations.Porvair said sales in the metals filtration business were 14 per cent higher than a year ago, while the mircofiltration division had benefited from a recovery in the aerospace industry. In response, house broker Altium Securities reiterated its “buy” recommendation.“With a 25 per cent drop through in the Metal Filtration division and 40 per cent drop through in microfiltration, if the trend of trading seen in the first four months continues for the rest of the year, there is scope for material upgrades.”Ambrian Capital added 3 per cent to 30½p after the bank announced that it was in talks to sell its commodities business to FCStone Inc, while takeover target Kalahari Minerals firmed 1.8 per cent to 237¾p after its chairman claimed there had been no talks with bidder CGNPC over price. In addition, Extract Resources, in which Kalahari Minerals owns a 43 per cent stake, announced positive results from a feasibility study on its Husab uranium project in Namibia.HMV Group fell a further 20 per cent to 12½p after the heavily indebted books and DVD retailer unleashed its third profits warning of the year. HMV now expects 2010-2011 pre-tax profits of £30m, around £10m less than analysts had been expecting.Seymour Pierce said radical action was needed but said it was difficult to see how a break-up would create value for shareholders.“With profits in freefall and net debt spiralling, it is difficult to see how a break-up of the group will create material value for shareholders given the group’s lease liability (£150m-£160m rent bill per annum) and costs which would be incurred when breaking up the business,” it said.The profits alert from HMV weighed on Game Group, which fell 7.7 per cent to 51p but Quintain Estates & Development rose 5.7 per cent to 46¼p on bid rumours and talk of a deal to finance its Wembley development.Wolfson Microelectronics, the audio chipmaker, was marked 5 per cent higher at 260p in the wake of a $6.5bn bid for National Semiconductor by Texas Instruments.“The deal demonstrates that analog (which is also Wolfson’s main area of expertise) is an area of strategic importance, however it also demonstrates the importance of scale, which Wolfson lacks in comparison,” said Numis Securities, as it upgraded its rating on the stock to “hold”.Bellzone Mining firmed 0.3 per cent to 69¼p after Canaccord Genuity said concerns about a stock overhang had been overplayed, as had worries about reserve estimates from its Kalia iron-ore project.“We believe the market has been concerned by the potential overhang of some 20 million shares being the holding in the Talbot estate. It is worth remembering we think that the Talbot Group invested in Bellzone at A$1.50 a share equivalent to £0.93 share, and as such the holdings are not in the money at current prices,” it said.“Regarding the DSO reserve estimates at Kalia, we believe the company is currently finalising various beneficiation scenarios, all of which we believe have shown positive results”.

STMicroelectronics topped the CAC 40 in Paris, rising 2.5 per cent to €9, while Infineon was Germany’s biggest gainer, up 3.9 per cent to €7.75.Airlines were hurt by worries about the price of oil, after Brent crude hit a record high on Monday. Barclays added to the pain by cutting price targets for five European airlines. Germany’s Lufthansa slid 0.7 per cent to €14.77. Air France-KLM fell 0.4 per cent to €11.47, and International Consolidated Airlines, the merged BA and Iberian operations, fell 0.6 per cent in Madrid to €2.53.Sentiment on Portugal took a fresh knock after Moody’s decision to cut the country’s credit rating, following downgrades from fellow rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor’s.Moody’s downgraded Portugal’s long-term government bond rating from A3 to Baa1, citing “increased political, budgetary and economic uncertainty”.The move pushed the PSI 20 index down 1 per cent to 7,792.25, with banks the biggest fallers, as Millennium BCP fell 2.6 per cent to €1.21.Commerzbank gained 3.1 per cent to €5.60 in Frankfurt after reports that it had made the bulk of its preparations for an anticipated capital hike. Bank of Cyprus rose 3.3 per cent to €2.52 on a falling Athens market after it won shareholder approval to raise up to €1.34bn in new capital. However, most financial stocks on the continent fell, sending the Eurofirst 300 banks index down 0.2 per cent.Parmalat fell 2.5 per cent to €2.31 in Milan on a newspaper report that Lactalis may be running out of patience in its attempt to gain control of the dairy producer.French energy companies were hurt by a government decision to curb tariff increases.

68;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-04T23:20:04Z;Texas Instruments in $6.5bn deal for Nat Semi;;Texas Instruments announced its biggest deal in more than a decade with the $6.5bn all-cash acquisition of Silicon Valley’s National Semiconductor.Dallas-based TI said on Monday that the move would strengthen its market leadership in analogue chips, which carry out functions such as power management, amplification and convert audio and video to digital signals in phones and media players.The deal is topped by the $7.4bn that TI paid for another analogue chipmaker, Burr-Brown, in June 2000 – its biggest ever buy.TI said it would pay $25 a share for National Semi, representing a 78 per cent premium to its closing price on Monday.TI shares fell 2 per cent to $33.42 in after-hours trading on the news, while Nat Semi’s were up 74 per cent at $24.47.“This acquisition is about strength and growth,” said Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and chief executive, in a statement. “National has an excellent development team and its products combined with our own can offer customers an analogue portfolio of unmatched depth and breadth.”Mr Templeton predicted strong returns on the investment, with a combined sales team, 10 times larger than National’s, able to accelerate growth.Both boards of directors unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close in six to nine months. TI plans to fund it with a combination of existing cash balances and debt.Mr Templeton told an analyst conference call that both parties were confident the deal would gain regulatory approval because of the depth of competition in a still-fragmented analogue market.Kevin March, TI chief financial officer, said it had existing cash balances of $3.1bn and with National Semi’s $900m, he expected to borrow $3bn-$4bn to complete the transaction. About $100m a year in cost savings have been identified.The Texas chipmaker has lost its position as the world’s leading wireless chipmaker to Qualcomm in recent years, but has been focusing more on analogue, offering 30,000 analogue products and operating the world’s first analogue factory based on the latest 300mm-diameter silicon wafers.National has manufacturing operations in Maine, Scotland and Malaysia.The addition of National’s portfolio will give TI 12,000 more analogue products and a strong position in the industrial power market.TI said the market for analogue semiconductors was worth $42bn last year, with TI being the market leader with revenues of $6bn or 14 per cent of the market. Adding National’s $1.6bn in revenues last year gives it a 17 per cent market share and sales of analogue chips will become almost 50 per cent of TI’s revenues.
69;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-04-01T21:24:32Z;Japan supply chain faces bleach shortage;;Just one part missing from an electronics device can halt its entire production, hence the ongoing concern about supplies of components from disaster-hit Japan.Base materials, such as the availability of silicon wafers from which chips are cut, have also been a focus and analysts at IHS iSuppli on Friday even fretted about the effect of possible shortages of hydrogen peroxide, better known as bleach, for cleaning purposes.Production of the chemical has been halted in Japan at Mitsubishi Gas and Chemical, Adeka Fuji and Nippon Peroxide, which together account for 75 per cent of global production of H²O².“That is a critical situation,” said Len Jelinek, iSuppli semiconductor manufacturing analyst, during a webinar on the Japan situation, “Numerous manufacturing fabs use this as a cleaning agent.”Shortages could result in a slowdown or a rebalancing of their operations, he said.“This is rapidly turning into a very concerning issue in Japan.”The extent of disruption to the supply chain can be limited by stocks on hand and Mike Howard, memory chip analyst, said there was little cause for concern in terms of Dram and Nand flash memory, the most common types used in electronics.Based on current raw wafer inventories, there would be no chance of any serious shortfalls before July, he said.Prices of Nand – the type of memory used in devices such as the iPad for main storage – were expected to ease in the second half, as supplies looked relatively abundant.IHS iSuppli’s analysis identified the automotive industry as becoming perhaps the most vulnerable to Japan supply chain problems in a period six to eight weeks out from the disaster, with Japan responsible for 32 per cent of the chips found in cars and important suppliers in Japan to the industry – Renesas Electronics, Texas Instruments, Freescale Semiconductor and Fujitsu – all affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
70;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Power cuts threaten technology supply chain;Semiconductor production affected by electricity blackouts in Japan;When the tsunami rolled into Takajo, just north of Sendai in Miyagi prefecture, a Sony factory was one of the buildings in its way.The first floor of the factory, which makes magnetic tape and Blu-ray discs, was inundated with flood water. Staff took refuge upstairs.Sony has just about finished clearing stricken boats, logs and debris from the site and it is about to start work on the mud – but the factory will be out of action for some time.Takajo shows the devastation that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami wreaked on the country’s technology industry almost two weeks ago, but the greater threat to the world’s supply chain is the power cuts that are hitting production north of Tokyo.The impact from the shortage of crucial components from Japan is rippling through global manufacturing sectors, including the technology and automotive industries, as they run short of key items such as chips.“Rolling blackouts are a very serious problem for the semiconductor industry,” said Takeshi Hattori, a semiconductor expert and president of Hattori Consulting International.Many chipmaking processes – such as growing the crystals of a silicon wafer or laying oxide in a furnace – take hours. If the power goes off halfway through, the work will be destroyed so a stable electricity supply is essential.Lack of power is also hampering the recovery effort at what Mr Hattori says is the most important semiconductor facility affected by the earthquake: a Shin-Etsu Chemical plant in Fukushima prefecture that supplies 20 per cent of the world’s silicon wafers. Silicon wafers are the starting point for making any computer chip.Shin-Etsu says it is still trying to establish the extent of the damage, but without power it is dark and dangerous inside the plant, so the work is going slowly.South Korea’s Hynix Semiconductor, the world’s second-largest memory chipmaker by sales, said it is asking other local and overseas suppliers of silicon wafers to increase their shipments in case the shortage is prolonged.Industry experts say that any production line flooded by tsunami water will have to be completely replaced.More factories suffered earthquake damage and should come back online quickly. At Mitsubishi Gas Chemical’s plant in Fukushima – which supplies essential bismaleimide triazine resin for many of the world’s mobile phones– the building is fine.MGC said that some internal partitions or fixtures attached to the ceiling fell and damaged machinery. Some of it can be repaired and MGC aims to restart production at 25 per cent of capacity in early April. It will prioritise the BT resin.Complicated semiconductor plants, where machines must be precisely calibrated and perfectly clean, will take a bit longer. Texas Instruments says that its large ‘fab’ in Miho will not be back to full capacity until July.For manufacturers the trouble is that “if you are missing one small screw then you can’t complete the product”, as one industry official puts it. Sony said on Tuesday that it will idle five plants in the west of Japan until March 31 because they have run out of parts. The factories make everything from TVs to camcorders.But this disruption is unlikely to last for too long because the technology supply chain is flexible. Companies are ramping up production with extra shifts at factories in places far from the earthquake: Fujitsu is shifting production of PCs and servers from a Fukushima factory to a similar one in the western province of Shimane, for example.“Things appear to be improving in Japan, which reinforces our view that there will be minimal impact on the technology supply chain,” said analysts at Nomura Securities.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul and Chris Nuttall in San Francisco
71;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-03-15T22:08:47Z;Wall St falls on Japan’s nuclear crisis;;"General Electric, Aflac and Halliburton were among the many stocks pulled lower as traders sold US equities on worries over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan.All 10 of the S&P sectors were hit as investors turned away from risky assets following two more explosions at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and warnings from the prime minister of “substantial” radiation leaks.Industrial stocks saw some of the heaviest losses. GE, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant, was one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&P, fell 1.6 per cent to $19.61.Related stocks also lost ground. 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $89.50 while Caterpillar was 1.3 per cent lower to $100.75. The S&P industrial index dropped 1.1 per cent.Some strategists argued that the industrial sell-off was surprising given that the sector might eventually benefit from the disaster. “In the medium term, some of these suppliers are going to be turned to the rebuilding effort,” said Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management.Elsewhere on Wall Street, insurers faced heavy selling on fears over the mounting costs of the natural disaster in Japan. Aflac was down 5.6 per cent to $50.89, making it the worst-performing stock on the S&P index, while Platinum Underwriters lost 1.2 per cent to $36.26. The KBW property casualty index was 1.3 per cent lower.Energy stocks fell away as oil prices softened on fears that a nuclear crisis would hamper global economic growth. Halliburton an oilfield services company, was down 2.3 per cent to $44.01 while ConocoPhillips was 1.1 per cent lower to $74.98. This left the S&P energy index 0.8 per cent softer, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,281.87 at the close, a six-week low.But the losses had been far more severe earlier in the session. The S&P tanked 2.1 per cent in the minutes after opening, but then edged higher through the rest of the session.The markets were given a boost following a statement by the Federal Reserve on monetary policy. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates steady, complete the current round of quantitative easing and said that the economy was on a “firmer footing”.“They came to the conclusion that there was no justification to rocking the
boat in the wake of ongoing development,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6 per cent in the past three weeks, with the feared effects of the disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. It is still up 1.9 per cent this year.Commentators trying to weigh up the impact of the disaster generally struck a more pessimistic tone than on Monday. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that the total damage to infrastructure could be as high as Y5,000bn-Y10,000bn.However, most added that the long-term prospects for US equities were positive. The “long-term real returns from stocks remain attractive, in our opinion, when compared with other assets, such as cash or Treasury bonds,” said strategists at PNC in a note.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 per cent to 11,855.42, a six-week low, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 2,667.33.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, rose 13 per cent to a six-month high in a sign that traders foresee more turbulence in the pipelines.In the technology sector Apple was down 2.3 per cent to $345.43 while Yahoo fell 5.7 per cent to $16.33.Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker after Intel, tumbled 1.9 per cent to $33.90 after saying that the “substantial” damage to one of its plants in Japan from the earthquake will hurt sales in the first and second quarters.The S&P technology sector was 1.8 per cent lower with traders retreating from a sector that has climbed 35 per cent in the six months from early September.All those companies with exposure to nuclear energy were badly hit for the second consecutive session. Uranium Resources lost 9.7 per cent to $1.58, adding to the 24.7 per cent fall in the previous session.Renewable energy stocks added to gains in the previous session as traders sought to capitalise on any backlash against nuclear power. First Solar was up 8.2 per cent to $158.91 while Suntech Power was up 9.9 per cent to $9.10.MEMC Electronic Materials was down 3.1 per cent to $12.95 in the session, but the silicon maker is still up 8.1 per cent over the last two days."
72;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Chipmakers hit hard by earthquake;;"Texas Instruments, the chipmaker that supplies components for a broad range of industries, has emerged as one of the foreign companies hardest hit by the Japanese earthquake.The Dallas-based company said a preliminary assessment had revealed substantial damage to its manufacturing site in Miho, about 40 miles north-east of Tokyo.A second factory in Aizu-wakamatsu, about 150 miles north of Tokyo, had also been damaged, it said, while its third Japanese facility, in Hiji, about 500 miles south of Tokyo and away from the disaster area, was running at normal capacity.TI is one of several semiconductor and electronics companies to have suffered direct damage from the earthquake. Chipmaking demands “clean room” conditions and is very sensitive to dust, vibration and power levels.Freescale Semiconductor of the US has also stopped production at its Sendai plant and evacuated workers, according to reports, while Shin-Etsu said that manufacturing of 300mm-diameter silicon wafers, from which chips are made, had been disrupted.Fujitsu has suffered plant damage, and seven Renesas facilities have been shut down, with five suffering structural damage.In electronics components, production has been hit at Panasonic, Hitachi, Toshiba, Canon, Nikon, NEC and Sony. However, the flat panel display industry appears to have escaped any serious damage, with factories concentrated away from the disaster area.TI said output from its Miho site accounted for about 10 per cent of its revenues last year. It makes analog chips and ones associated with its DLP display technology. Around 60 per cent of work in process was damaged and not recoverable, it said; infrastructure supplying chemicals, gases, water and air had been damaged and would take three weeks to repair.The chipmaker expected to incur expenses and lost revenues in the first and second quarter as it moved production to other factories. It did not anticipate Miho getting back to full production until mid-July, which would mean full shipment capability delayed until September.The company has been sending more staff into Japan rather than evacuating workers – teams from Dallas and Malaysia were on the ground, with additional teams en route.TI warned that, like other companies, its schedule could be delayed by continuing instability in the region’s power grid. Equipment at its factory in Aizu-wakamatsu is already being restarted, with full production estimated to resume by mid-April, assuming a stable power supply. The full financial impact on TI is expected to be revealed in its first-quarter earnings report next month.Chip companies could ultimately benefit from higher prices for their products created by fears of short supply. Prices of dynamic random access memory chips, used in PCs, and the Nand flash memory chips in mobile phones, jumped sharply on Taipei’s DRAMeXchange this week.Apple said on Tuesday that it would delay the planned March 25 launch of the iPad 2 in Japan, writes Joseph Menn in San Francisco.Nat Kerris, company spokeswoman, said Apple wanted to focus on helping employees and their families affected by the quake and tsunami. “Our hearts go out to the people of Japan, including our employees and their families”, Ms Kerris said. She said Apple’s decision was not driven by supply-chain issues, and that all Apple stores and other facilities in the country remained open.Apple will go ahead with the launch of the second-generation tablet on the same day in dozens of other countries.Strong demand for the iPad 2 since its US debut on Friday has depleted stock in many Apple stores and other retail locations. Estimates for delivery from Apple’s online store have been pushed back to four weeks or more.“We are working to get the iPad 2 into the hands of as many customers as possible,” Ms Kerris said. “Demand has been amazing.”"
73;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-03-15T17:43:47Z;Next rises as London’s wider market drops;;Next was the favoured defensive stock on Tuesday, with the retailer one of only five blue-chip risers.The shares bounced by 2 per cent to £19.05 after Credit Suisse said the prevailing view that Next was hiking prices was wrong.Next said in January it would raise prices by about 8 per cent to offset rising materials costs and VAT. But, rather than speculating on where customers would spend more, Next has taken the defensive approach of offering fewer choices at targeted price points, said analyst Tony Shiret. As a result, the average women's wear selling price was down 7 per cent on last year, he calculated.“Next is perhaps better set up than investors realise for the short and medium term,” said Mr Shiret, who repeated a £30 target on the stock.The wider market fell for a fifth straight day, with the FTSE 100 down as much as 3.2 per cent in mid-morning, its sharpest intraday fall since June. The index then rallied with Wall Street to close down 1.4 per cent, or 79.96 points, at 5,695.28.Fears about global growth and a tempering of Asian demand weighed on the commodities sector, with Essar Energy lower by 3.6 per cent to 479p and BP off 1.8 per cent to 451¼p.Lonmin fell 2.9 per cent to £16.28 and Aquarius Platinumedged 0.2 per cent lower to 336p after the disruption to Japan’s auto industry helped push prices for the platinum group metals (PGM) to their lowest levels in a year. A stronger South African rand provided another earnings headwind for the miners, analysts said.“We see spot downgrade risk for calendar 2011 of circa 40 per cent for both Lonmin and Aquarius at current prices and currencies, all of which lie below market forecasts,” said Credit Suisse.“The UK PGM sector has the greatest earnings risk among all UK miners.”Fresnillo was the sharpest blue-chip faller, down 4.4 per cent to £14.33, as gold and silver prices retreated. African Barrick Gold slid 2 per cent to 508p and Randgold Resources lost 1.8 per cent to £44.25.Heritage Oil dropped by 14.2 per cent to 285¼p. Dealers said the sharp fall probably reflected the fact that investors, who had bought into recent speculation of bid interest, were selling their holdings to cover losses elsewhere.Burberry fell by a further 1.2 per cent to £11.10. About a quarter of its earnings this year were expected to come from its licensing business, which takes about two-thirds of its sales from Japan, analysts said.British Airways owner IAG fell 4 per cent to 220¾p after German flag-carrier Lufthansa said it was diverting Tokyo-bound flights to other Japanese cities. InterContinental Hotels weakened by 2.5 per cent to £12.55.Semiconductor stocks trended lower after Texas Instruments said the earthquake had caused “substantial damage” to its fabrication plant in Miho, Japan. Arm Holdings, which takes an estimated 11 per cent of revenue from Japanese manufacturers, closed off 1.5 per cent to 517½p. CSR, with about 13 per cent of sales to Japan, lost 0.5 per cent at 376½p.As well as the direct damage, there was a danger that manufacturers worldwide would halt some production as the damage, power cuts and broken infrastructure led to components shortages, RBS analysts said.Gauge maker Renishaw fell 6.8 per cent to £15.85 and AZ Electronic Materials, the chemical maker for computer screens, dropped by 4.9 per cent to 258p.But Hansen Transmissions, the gearbox maker for wind turbines, gained 6 per cent to 47p as renewed interest in renewable energy boosted its key customers such as Vestas.The same rationale lifted RPS Group, the environmental consultant, by 7 per cent to 213p.Among small caps, Avanti Communicationsrose 6.2 per cent to 450p after the group completed in-orbit testing of its first satellite, Hylas 1.Kalahari Minerals fell 11.5 per cent to 243¼p on concerns its Chinese suitor might revise its offer for the company, which indirectly owns a stake in a uranium project in Namibia.MBL Groupdropped 50 per cent to 15½p after the CD and DVD distributor said that Wm Morrison, its biggest customer, had terminated its two supply agreements.Nightclub operator Luminar fell 9.6 per cent to 11¾p after a disappointing trading update.
74;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-03-10T11:13:14Z;Heavy losses in Asia as political risks weigh;;Asian stocks had their biggest losses in more than two weeks as growth bulls were forced on to the back foot by surprisingly weak trade data from Beijing and rising Libyan turmoil.Chinese carmakers were particularly hit after vehicles sales in the country grew at the slowest pace in more than two years.The FTSE Asia Pacific index sank 1.5 per cent to 262.08, with Japanese gross domestic product shrinking more than forecast and South Korea’s central bank raising interest rates for the second time this year also weighing on sentiment.“It’s hard to know how high oil prices will go and how much that will damage the economy,” Mitsushige Akino of Ichiyoshi Investment Management told Bloomberg. “That’s deterring investors from putting new money into stocks.”The Shanghai Composite’s recent rally, which has seen it emerge as the best- performing Asian index in 2011, came to a juddering halt as it sank 1.5 per cent to 2,957.14 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.8 per cent to 23,614.89.Carmakers leading the retreat included Dongfeng Motor, the Chinese partner of Nissan, which fell 2.8 per cent to HK$13.80 while Guangzhou Automobile, linked to Toyota and Honda, sank 3.7 per cent to HK$9.63. FAW Car, Volkswagen’s partner, lost 2.2 per cent to Rmb17.90.Profit-taking hit financials with HSBC down 1.4 per cent to HK$83.70 while the cloudier growth outlook weighed on metal producers, Jiangxi Copper slumping 4 per cent to Rmb40.33.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average fell 1.5 per cent to 10,434.38, a five-week low.Fanuc, the industrial robot manufacturer that earns about 80 per cent of its revenue overseas, sank 2.7 per cent to Y12,530, the heaviest drag on the Nikkei.Elpida Memory, the world’s third-largest maker of computer memory chips, tumbled 8 per cent to Y1,107 after US peer Texas Instruments trimmed its forecasts.The Kospi index in Seoul, off 1 per cent at 1,981.58, and Mumbai’s BSE Sensex, down 0.8 per cent to 18,327.98, completed the weak regional picture.But some positivity emerged from south-east Asia with Vietnam’s VN index jumping 2.6 per cent to 482.49 on talk of a clampdown on illegal currency trading while the Philippine Stock Exchange index rose 0.8 per cent to 3,959.94, a six-week high.
75;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Wall Street falls amid turmoil in Libya;;Wall Street marked the two-year anniversary of the bull market with a whimper, edging lower on continuing concern over the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and some disappointing earnings forecasts in the technology sector.Technology stocks were shaken after Finisar gave a worse than expected earnings forecast.The maker of fibre-optic cables fell 38.5 per cent to $24.61 after announcing that demand for its product in China was slowing and forecasting a quarterly profit of 31-35 cents a share, short of the expected 48 cents a share.The weak estimate prompted sharp losses in related stocks. JDS Uniphase, another maker of optical communications, was down 16.7 per cent to $21.14, while Oclaro declined 18.6 per cent to $13.53. The technology sector was down 1.4 per cent, one of the worst performing S&P subindexes.The optical communications sector has been volatile in the past few years. JDS Uniphase is up 827 per cent since March 2009. It has put on 46 per cent this year and is one of the biggest gainers on the S&P in the last six months.Finisar is up 999 per cent in two years, and was up 35 per cent this year before Wednesday’s losses.Also weighing on the wider technology sector was Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales, which issued a current-quarter earnings target slightly below estimates, citing slower-than-expected demand for chips used in personal computers. Shares were down 3.1 per cent to $34.74.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1,320.02 as reports that an oil storage facility had been damaged in Libya led energy prices higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,208.55 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,750.03.Many strategists were asking whether the 1.8 per cent losses on the S&P since mid-February due to the elevated oil price was the start of the long-awaited correction in the US markets.“There will be a correction at some point, and this could be it if oil prices continue to march higher,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.Sharper losses on the S&P earlier in the day were pared, however, after economic data showing that US wholesale inventories had risen higher than expected in January.Inventories were up 1.1 per cent to a seasonally-adjusted $436.88bn, its highest since November 2008, which was ahead of the 0.9 per cent increase predicted by economists.Still, the higher oil price dampened risk appetite and weighed on material and industrial stocks on Wall Street.In the materials sector, Cliff Natural Resources was down 5.3 per cent to $91.56 while US Steel declined 3.4 per cent to $53.85.The S&P materials index was down 1.5 per cent.Industrial stocks fell 0.4 per cent with Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, falling 1.7 per cent to $102.36 and Deere, the tractor maker, down 1.9 per cent to $89.82.Elsewhere on Wall Street, fertiliser companies lost ground after Citigroup cut its investment ratings on PotashCorp and Mosaic to “hold” from “buy”. Citigroup’s note said it was “time to harvest profits” from the North American fertiliser companies.Shares in Potash were down 4.2 per cent at $55.82 while Mosaic was 3.3 per cent lower at $78.84.Also in the sector, CF Industries was 1.9 per cent softer at $126.52 while Monsanto declined 3.3 per cent to $69.39.Elsewhere Walgreen, the drugstore chain, agreed to sell its pharmacy benefit management unit to Catalyst Health Solutions for $525m. Shares in Walgreen were up 0.5 per cent to $42.61, while Catalyst Health Solutions added 18.6 per cent $52.80.Suntech Power Holdings, one of the world’s largest solar groups, was up 2.8 per cent to $9.25 after reporting strong fourth-quarter profits. The company earned $383.4m, or $2.02 per American depositary share, in the quarter, up from $44m, or 24 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, was up 1.8 per cent to $41.88 after Barclays raised its investment rating on the stock to “overweight” from “equal weight”.It is now exactly two years since the post-crisis nadir for the S&P 500 when it closed at 676.53. Since then the index is up 95 per cent, led by the autos and components sub-index, which is up 360 per cent from the bottom.S&P 500 stocks have been outperformed, however, by their smaller rivals in the past two years. Both the S&P 400 mid-cap index and the Russell 2000 small-cap index are up about 140 per cent.In the same time period, the FTSE-All World index has more than doubled, while emerging markets have gained some 145 per cent.
76;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-03-02T21:36:48Z;US stocks rebound in late trading;;"Shares in Yahoo rose following unconfirmed reports that the internet search company was in talks to sell or trade its stake in Yahoo Japan, while the broad market rebounded from mid-session losses to close modestly firmer.Yahoo might be looking to exchange its 35 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan and give the majority owner Softbank a stake in the US company, according to a report in the Financial Times citing people familiar with the discussions.Any negotiations however, according to sources, were in the formative stages and the talks could still go nowhere. Yahoo rose 3.3 per cent to $16.63, one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500.Softbank, which holds a 41 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, on Wednesday said there was “no truth” to the media reports. Yahoo declined to comment.Other technology stocks were also in focus. Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, gained 3.3 per cent to $36.14 as JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral”.Another semiconductor company, Xilinx, rallied 5.6 per cent to $34.54 while Altera gained 3 per cent to $42.46. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.4 per cent while the S&P technology index rose 0.5 per cent, the strongest gainer along with energy of all 10 major S&P indices.That helped stem losses on the S&P 500, which closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,308.44, trimming some of its 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.The index is still off 2.6 per cent from its mid-February high, because of fears that sustained high oil prices due to political instability in north Africa and the Middle East may
hamper economic growth.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent to 12,066.80 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,748.07.Sentiment was lifted somewhat by the ADP national employment report which suggested that job creation had been strong in February. The report estimated that private non-farm payroll employment had risen by 217,000 last month, ahead of the 180,000 expected by economists.This was a positive leading indicator for the official non-farm payroll figures which will come out on Friday, although the ADP number is not always a successful predictor of these widely watched numbers.“ADP has not exactly covered itself in glory recently in terms of accuracy versus the government data, so we don’t look for any change to the published median forecast of 193,000 for total non-farm payrolls and 200,000 for private payrolls,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Worries over oil prices, which edged up in the session, continued to weigh on sentiment in the wider markets.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the previous session that higher oil prices were “a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability”.Some economists appeared more worried about the inflationary risk of the higher oil price than the chance of it damaging growth. “I think fears are overblown of a sharp oil-related downturn in global growth. I worry more about the inflationary consequences,” said Joachim Fels, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global economics team.Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company which fell 6.3 per cent in the previous session after announcing in its annual report that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bounced back slightly, rising 1.2 per cent to $44.24.Some analysts suggested that this might be an opportunity to buy the stock. “We believe this news will have limited fallout given the huge successes that LVS has had in Macau and Singapore and its ability to execute on a true integrated resort,” Citigroup said.Costco Wholesale reported a 16 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings but this failed to impress investors. The stock fell 2.5 per cent to $71.76.Elsewhere in the sector, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, reported an 81 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits on charges related to store closures. But the company also reported that same-store sales had risen by 5.5 per cent. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $49.66.Apple was in focus as it unveiled the second edition of the iPad. Shares rose 0.8 per cent to $352.12."
77;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-25T22:29:26Z;US housing data weigh on Wall Street;;Investors on Wall Street took a negative view on a number of earnings reports, including from Johnson & Johnson, but the wider markets were flat after mixed economic data.The healthcare group posted profits down 12 per cent on the previous year and below analysts’ expectations. This was mainly due to a $922m charge related to the ASR hip recall from its DePuy subsidiary. The company also issued a downbeat 2011 earnings forecast of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, less than the $4.97 a share projected by analysts.William Weldon, chief executive, said that the company would continue to see near-term pressure on the business this year. Shares in Johnson & Johnson were down 1.8 per cent to $61.08.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,291.18 as a raft of mixed economic data from home and abroad failed to provide direction to the market.Figures from the Conference Board showed that US consumer confidence had increased by considerably more than forecast in December. But separate data showed that house prices were continuing to fall, according to the Case-Shiller index.Looking abroad, news that UK gross domestic product shrunk in the fourth quarter and that India had raised interest rates again weighed on sentiment, in particular dragging down commodity-related stocks.Murphy Oil, the oil and gas exploration and production company, was down 1.4 per cent to $71.04 while Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore and coal miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $81.74.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 11,977.19, maintaining the two-year highs reached in the previous session, while the Nasdaq Composite was fractionally up after a late rally to 2,719.25.The session was one of the busiest days for earnings reports, and overall the market reacted negatively to the results.While many results came in below forecasts, even many forecast-beating results failed to impress investors. Analysts said this had been one of the key stories of the earnings season so far, with many stocks like Schlumberger, Google, and F5 Networks losing ground on the day that strong earnings are released due to market expectations of blockbuster results.“Last quarter, expectations were lower so strong results were more of a market driver, but this quarter people are generally more optimistic so the earnings bar has been set higher,” said Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Investors were disappointed by results from 3M, for example, even though the earnings came in slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations. The maker of office, medical and industrial products, posted a fourth-quarter profit of $928m, or $1.28 a share.The results topped analysts’ forecasts and 3M raised its 2011 earnings forecast, but its shares were down 2 per cent to $88.50.Shares in Texas Instruments also saw losses despite posting earnings ahead of expectations. The chipmaker reported fourth-quarter revenues of $3.53bn and earnings per share of 78 cents, which exceeded expectations of 64 cents a share. But its shares were down 1.9 per cent to $33.98.In other earnings news, American Express, the biggest US credit-card issuer by purchases, reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. A $74m charge tied to job cuts in its servicing network dragged on the figures, but even without the charge the company would have earned 94 cents a share, less than the average estimate of 96 cents by analysts. The stock fell 2.2 per cent to $44.80.Investors on Wall Street were also looking towards the State of the Union address which was to be delivered on Tuesday night. “President Obama’s State of the Union address is likely to be more pro-business in contrast to the anti-business tone of last year’s address,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.Also in earnings news, DuPont the world’s second-biggest chemicals maker by market capitalisation, was up 0.3 per cent to $49.04 after mixed results which saw revenue increase but profits fall due to charges.Verizon Communications was up 1.6 per cent to $35.79 after the company posted earnings per share of 54 cents on revenue of $26.4bn.In deal news, Amgen said it had agreed to buy BioVex Group, a private cancer drug company, for up to $1 billion, sending shares in Amgen down 0.2 per cent to $57.16.The biotechnology group said it would pay $425 million up front and as much as $575 million in additional payments.The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, is due to be completed in March when BioVex will become a subsidiary of Amgen.The announcement came as Amgen reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but gave 2011 earnings estimates that were less than analysts had estimated.
78;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;STMicro benefits from recovery in chip sector;;ST Microelectronics capped 2010 with a solid set of fourth-quarter results as Europe’s largest semiconductor company continued to benefit from a strong recovery in the chip sector and a recent restructuring.However, STMicro’s shares fell on news that losses its ST-Ericsson wireless joint venture had widened. STMicro also warned that group sales in the first three months of this year, traditionally the weakest and slowest of the chip cycle, would be lower sequentially by about 7 to 12 per cent.The Franco-Italian group was hit hard by the downturn but has streamlined its business, spinning off loss-making ventures and merging its wireless business into a joint venture with Ericsson.“In the last eight quarters, ST went through the most severe economic recession in 2009 and successfully capitalised on the 2010 market recovery. Throughout this time frame we remained focused on our growth and profitability objectives,” said Carlo Bozotti, president and chief executive.STMicro – whose chips are used in cars, computers and a range of consumer electronic devices – swung to a fourth-quarter net profit of $219m or $0.24 per share, compared with a loss of $70m the year before, on sales up 6.6 per cent at $2.8bn. Profits were at the top end of STMicro’s range and ahead of consensus forecasts by analysts.For the full year, net profits rose to $830m or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.1bn or $1.29 per share in 2009, on sales up 21.6 per cent to $10.3bn.“The ST-Ericsson results were worse than I expected, but the core business is going from strength to strength,” said Didier Scemama, technology analyst at RBS. “STMicro is positioned in the right segments for strong growth and they have unique products which will give them a lead in the market.”Mr Bozotti said the group’s turnround was now complete and he expected to see continued improvement, including from ST-Ericsson, by the second half of the year.He said that while the chipmaker’s growth was expected to be “more moderate” in 2011, the group expected “to deliver above-market revenue growth accompanied by further year-over-year improvements in quarterly operating profitability”.Earlier this month, bigger US rival Intel reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and said sales have been buoyed by strong demand for its chips in servers in data centres. However, the group, which dominates the personal computer market, is yet to gain a significant share of the fast-growing market for chips for smartphones and tablet computers such as the iPad.Texas Instruments, which reported on Monday, said it was benefiting from high demand for its chips in iPhones and tablets.Shares in STMicro, which have risen more than 40 per cent over the past year, closed down 3 per cent in Paris at €8.30.Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson in Paris

80;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
81;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Chip demand lifts Texas Instruments profits;;Texas Instruments benefited from booming demand for its chips in smartphones and tablets as it reported fourth-quarter sales and profits slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations.Dallas-based TI said on Monday that its analog and embedded processing divisions also contributed to strong revenue growth of 34 per cent in 2010.The chipmaker reported fourth-quarter revenues of $3.53bn and earnings per share of 78 cents, boosted by a disposal and a tax benefit worth 14 cents.Excluding these, earnings of 64 cents a share were just ahead of analysts’ expectations of 63 cents and sales of $3.51bn.Rich Templeton, chief executive, said a strong fourth quarter reinforced TI’s view that “the inventory-driven downturn that started in the second half of 2010 is now mostly complete”.“We used this short and shallow downturn to replenish our inventory, return product lead times to normal and ramp up three new factories. As markets start to grow again, we are well positioned with the products and manufacturing capacity that our customers need.”TI issued a first-quarter revenue forecast range with a mid-point of $3.41bn, ahead of analyst expectations of $3.34bn, with its earnings prediction matching Wall Street’s 58 cents a share.TI shares were down 2.3 per cent in extended trading in New York on the news, at $33.86.
82;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-06T23:04:27Z;Microsoft strengthens the outlook for Arm;;"Arm Holdings is the pin-up of the UK technology sector. The Cambridge-based group, whose chip designs feature in electronic devices made by international brands such as Samsung, Sony, Nokia and Apple, has seen its share price rise more than 150 per cent in the past 12 months as investors bet big on the group’s growth potential.On Thursday Arm shares rose by as much as 13 per cent after Microsoft told visitors to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Arm chip designs would feature in a new version of the Windows operating system.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said that Microsoft would roll out a new class of less energy intensive chips based on Arm designs and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.The move is part of efforts to widen Windows beyond basic personal computers to portable devices, and Microsoft signalled that it would be two to three years before Arm chips featured in its devices.Lee Simpson, analyst at Jefferies, says Microsoft’s announcement was little more than confirmation that Arm was making good on its promise to widen the range of devices on which its chip designs can work.The market has long anticipated that Arm-based chips would feature in Windows 8 and had priced that into the stock. Following the announcement by Microsoft, graphics specialist Nvidia also said that it would be developing a new Arm-based core processor for desktops and servers.Both announcements underline how Arm, whose low-powered chip designs feature in 95 per cent of mobile phones sold worldwide as well as in other products, is widening its market. The group has until recently made little headway in the higher-power computer chip segment where Intel dominates.Arm’s focus on designing energy efficient chips for phones has been buoyed by the launch of smartphones such as the iPhone, as each device uses more Arm- designed chips than a conventional “dumb” handset.But its business model looks even more clever given that Arm’s chips are now being used in tablets, a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.Arm’s chips appear in Apple’s iPad, and will feature in Microsoft’s next range of mobile products.The iPad’s success has opened the floodgates to copycats from rivals such as Toshiba, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard. And with analysts predicting nearly 60m devices could be sold next year, Arm’s presence in the segment has boosted its value.Richard Holway at TechMarketView says that if consumers treat their tablet computers more like their phones and upgrade their devices more often, even those estimates may be too conservative.A move up the scale towards mobile PCs will enable Arm to command higher fees for each chip sold, though the market is smaller than for phones.Yet even given the strong outlook, Arm’s market
capitalisation of more than £6bn looks full.Arm has created a solid business model licensing its designs and collecting royalties once the chips are in operation. Yet analysts expect Arm to report full-year pre-tax profits of only about £140m on sales of nearly £400m next month.Sandeep S Deshpande, analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, says the stock looks expensive. Prospective earnings for 2014, for example, when he estimates as many as 200m tablets could be sold globally, would put Arm on 30.2 times earnings per share. To put that into perspective, Google and Apple, two other high-growth companies, are expected to trade at 11.6 times and 10.8 times 2014 earnings respectively, based on consensus estimates.Arm points out that its chip designs also appear in microcontrollers and printers and says that the company’s chips will start appearing in servers in the next five years.Speculation that Arm could be a takeover target for a big US group has also fed into the share price.Warren East, chief executive, insists that there would be little value in any one of its customers buying the company given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to remove the cost of researching and designing chips for a wide range of clients.Analysts largely agree. The most likely candidate would be Intel, which has the cash to make a purchase and could use a deal to squash its competition. But even a deal by Intel seems unlikely given it would likely face competition issues from regulators.The greater risk is that Intel hits back by eating into Arm’s market share in chips for phones. Intel’s Atom chip, which has been used in netbooks, has been adapted for smartphones.Ian Drew, head of marketing at Arm, says the company knows “it can’t rest on its laurels” and will continue to innovate.In the meantime, investors look set to keep buying into the company’s potential. Arm is “the lighthouse” of the UK tech sector, says Mr Deshpande. How long that light shines for remains to be seen.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and Paul Taylor"
83;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-06T22:01:09Z;Retail sales report weighs on US stocks;;Gap, Target and Macy’s were among the retail stocks that fell after weak festive holiday trading but positive news from the jobs market helped US stocks pare losses.The final verdict on retailers’ holiday shopping season was disappointing as many large chains missed their estimates.Retail Metrics said its index of same-store sales had risen 3.2 per cent against analysts’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1.6 per cent while the wider consumer discretionary sector sank 0.7 per cent. The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained. Nvidia soared 13.8 per cent to $19.33, while Qualcomm added 1.2 per cent to $52.67 and Texas Instruments gained 1.4 per cent to $33.25.Intel, which used to dominate the processor market, fell 0.8 per cent to $20.77.Initial jobless claims edged up by 18,000 to a total of 409,000 last week, but the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits fell. The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.
84;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-06T21:23:06Z;Microsoft needs to rethink tablets;;If Microsoft needed a change of technology strategy to give itself a chance of catching up with Apple’s iPad, it was evident this week in the US prices that Taiwan’s Asus unveiled for its own forthcoming line of touchscreen tablet computers.Three of the machines, which will run on the Android operating system from Google, will carry price tags of between $399 and $499 – a level competitive with the least expensive version of the iPad, which sells for $499.But the fourth machine, carrying Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating software, will cost buyers $999.In reaching down into the tablet market from its perch in the PC world, Microsoft has been found wanting.Even though it was the company that pioneered full, keyboard-less computers nearly a decade ago – although the tablet PCs it spawned rely on a stylus, not fingers, for contact – must make this message all the harder to swallow.Its earlier software was designed for full-powered PCs, capable of running the gamut of heavy-duty applications and with hardware specifications to match.But Microsoft has more than just price to catch up on, as it revises its plans for Windows on mobile devices.“There is only so much you can do with Windows 7 on a touchscreen,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, consumer PC and tablet analyst at Forrester Research. “It isn’t designed for a touch experience.”The answer, according to Microsoft, will come in a complete rewrite of Windows to make it more suitable for all the lightweight, touchscreen personal computing devices of the future – not just today’s tablets, like the iPad.It will also entail an erosion of the central “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has presided over the PC era, as the software company looks beyond its traditional chip partner to extend its software to silicon produced by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments – all of which use designs from UK-based Arm.The silicon used in these devices will require less power, will pack more of a computer’s functions into less space and should prove more reliable, according to Steven Sinofsky, head of the Windows and Windows Live internet businesses.Unveiling the plans now will give the many hardware makers that have built their own strategies around Microsoft technology time to plan for the new direction: but it also means a wait of two-three years before the software company has a true response to the iPad.Microsoft may be taking longer than some, but it is not the only one to have been scrambling this week to present a coherent response to the iPad.Much of the anticipation around tablets at the annual Consumer Electronics Show this week has been centred on the Android operating system, which Google originally designed to run on so-called smartphones.A new version, codenamed Honeycomb, has been designed to accommodate the larger screens of tablets.But while tablets designed to run on Honeycomb have been in plentiful supply, hard evidence of the software has been in short supply among the Las Vegas slot machines and craps tables this week.Google was reduced to issuing a tease for the latest version of Android late on Wednesday, offering what it called a “sneak peek” of Honeycomb.Motorola, one of the many hopefuls lining up behind the software, predicted that it would be the first out with a full Android tablet, with the machine on sale before the end of March.For Microsoft, meanwhile, there may have been little choice but to dig in for the long haul. Its Windows Phone 7 smartphone software, released to considerable acclaim late last year, supports many of the main functions users also look for in tablets, said Ms Ebbs.These include accessing Facebook, catching up with e-mail or watching video.But that software was narrowly designed for small screens, according to Microsoft executives, and has a user interface and closely defined hardware requirements that are not suitable for tablets.With the iPad expected to dominate the booming tablet market this year, the long wait has just begun.

The move puts Nvidia in direct competition with Intel.Warren East, Arm’s chief executive, has said that the company expects to benefit from an expected leap in demand for tablet computers, which are seen as a crossover product between smartphones and netbooks.The success of the iPad has prompted companies including Toshiba, Motorola, Research in Motion and Hewlett-Packard to rush to bring out their own tablets.Microsoft said Arm-designed chips would not start to be seen in new devices for another two or three years. Arm’s chips currently feature in a version of Windows that runs on the US group’s smartphones.In July, Arm signed a deal with Microsoft to extend and expand on an existing long-running licensing agreement. The deal gave Microsoft access to Arm’s core architecture, rather than licensing one product at a time. Microsoft had until relatively recently relied on Intel to supply most of its chips, though it has been widening its relationships with other chipmakers and designers.Shares in Arm have risen more than 150 per cent over the past year, boosted by speculation of a possible shift into supplying designs for Microsoft and news that Arm’s chip designs featured in iPhone 4 and iPad, Apple’s highly successful tablet computer.The group, which is trading on 44 times 2011 earnings, has also been seen by some as a prospective takeover target.Arm, whose shares were trading at 532½p early on Thursday, makes its money by licensing its chip designs to semiconductor makers and then collecting royalties once the chips go into new products.Mr East continues to insist that buying the company would make little sense to another chipmaker, given that Arm’s strength is its neutrality and ability to service lots of customers with its designs, thereby saving them the cost of research and development.

87;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-06T00:21:11Z;Microsoft in Windows tablet move;;Microsoft has broken with two and a half decades of company history with plans to extend its next Windows operating system beyond the realm of traditional PC chips, repositioning itself for the upheaval in personal computing touched off by Apple’s iPad.However, the change in technology strategy, which marks a turning point in the so-called “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has dominated the PC era, will not bear fruit in new devices for “two to three years”, a Microsoft executive said.The world’s biggest software company announced its plans on Wednesday, on the eve of the annual International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which is set to see the unveiling of a slew of touch-screen tablet computers designed to compete with the iPad.Companies including Motorola and Toshiba showed off tablets on Wednesday that will run on a new version of Google’s Android operating system, which is also being revised to make it a stronger competitor to the software underpinning the iPad. While no launch dates or prices were given, executives indicated they planned to put the devices on sale before the end of March.Lenovo and Samsung also showed off hybrid devices with built-in keyboards that can be used either as a tablet or a laptop PC, echoing a design already launched by Dell.Despite the coming spate of rivals, most analysts predict that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet category this year.Microsoft played down the competition with Apple as it demonstrated Windows running on a new class of chips with lower power requirements, making them more suitable for portable devices.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said the new technology direction was intended eventually for a wider family of machines than tablets. The change will put Windows on chips based on a design by the UK’s Arm Holdings and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.Microsoft presented the move as part of a broader strategy that would benefit Intel and AMD, makers of traditional PC chips.The next version of Windows will run on so-called “system on a chip” hardware – integrated pieces of silicon that combine processor, memory, graphics and other functions that previously required larger circuit boards.A version of Windows for smartphones already runs on ARM chips, but Mr Sinofsky continued to resist calls for Microsoft to use this to mount an earlier challenge to the iPad.
88;TXN;Texas Instruments;2011-01-03T17:40:07Z;Silver screen strikes gold in China;;The holiday season in the west may be over but for the Chinese film industry party time has begun.Blockbusters in the final weeks of 2010, led by the gangster comedy Let The Bullets Fly, helped China’s annual box-office receipts rise 40 per cent to Rmb10bn ($1.5bn).The film, starring Chow Yun Fat, earned Rmb453m in its first two weeks when it came out at the end of December, and it continues to sell well.Film companies expect the hunger for entertainment of China’s growing middle class as well as heavy investment in new cinemas to continue to fuel expansion for years.China has 5,000 screens, about one-eighth of the US. But the country adds new cinemas at the pace of three screens a day, faster than any other market.“It will be the world’s largest cinema industry in 10 years or less,” says Tony Adamson, marketing head for DLP, the digital cinema technology arm of Texas Instruments.“China could have as many as 100,000 screens and it would not be over-screened.”International companies are piling in.Imax has raised the number of cinemas planned in China by 15 to 96, and Lotte Cinemas of South Korea is planning to build 30 theatres in the country this year.The lion’s share of the growth is in smaller cities, some of which do not have any cinemas.Zhang Baoquan, president of Antaeus Group, a real estate conglomerate which is expanding into film, says he expects cinema construction to spread like wildfire in areas outside the main cities, driven by urbanisation and the increasing availability of digital projection.“In the US only one-third of all screens are digital so far, but I expect China to be 100 per cent digital by the end of 2011,” Mr Zhang says.While converting existing cinemas requires sizeable investment, there is no additional cost to equip a new cinema for digital projection.“The increase in screens raises the average revenues per movie, so you can spend more per film – hire better directors, get better scripts, have better special effects,” says Jiang Yanming, one of China’s leading visual effects producers.“We will be making better movies.”Recent releases would suggest that this is happening, at least as far as ticket receipts are concerned.In 2009, China saw its first locally produced horror film, Painted Skin.Last year, the country’s audiences were treated to a Chinese “chick flick”, Go Lala Go, a Hollywoodesque romance about a Beijing office girl. It made Rmb124.5m.Fox released its first Chinese-language movie, Hot Summer Days, which it co-produced with Huayi Brothers, China’s largest studio. The romantic comedy made Rmb125.8m.“These firsts are indicative of the opportunity,” says Sanford Panitch, president of Fox International Productions.“For a long time, most Chinese films tended to be period, and now you’re seeing more commercially minded films, clearly in response to a growing middle class audience.”But there remains a barrier to foreign filmmakers.The Chinese government, which keeps the industry under strict control in the name of protecting public morals and Chinese culture, has an annual quota of 20 foreign films for distribution by two state-owned companies.The World Trade Organisation ruled last year that China was breaking its 2001 WTO entry terms and that this restriction must be changed.However, few in the industry expect the government to take meaningful action to open up the market further, so the only way in for foreign film companies is through co-production with Chinese partners.The films will continue to be censored for sex and violence because China does not have a film ratings system. They may also be banned for political reasons.Zhang Xun, president of China Film Cooperation Corporation, the state outlet which supervises co-productions, says CFCC rejected a script from Taiwan about a policeman with mafia ties.She says: “We absolutely do not encourage such films. The institutions of the state are a force for good in any country. We do not hope to describe China’s police as that ugly. We hope that justice can defeat evil.”CFCC interfered in Yip Man, a kung fu drama set under Japanese occupation in the 1940s.“The unity and power of the Chinese when the Japanese invaded – none of that appeared in the original script,” Ms Zhang says.Some foreign studios find such interference too much to swallow. Joint productions are growing more slowly than the market. According to CFCC, it received 75 applications in 2009 and 90 last year.
89;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-12-09T09:58:06Z;ASML;The chips are up for Europe’s biggest semiconductor equipment maker;"The chips are up. Semiconductor-makers are an exuberant bunch when times are good and this year is no exception: they have doubled capital expenditure, according to UBS. Yet their desire for new kit is still not sated. ASML, which makes equipment for chipmakers, surprised the market on Thursday by forecasting a record order book for the last quarter of the year, implying their customers’ shopping spree should continue well into 2011. The Dutch company’s shares jumped 8 per cent, to their highest level since the beginning of 2008.There are strategic reasons to keep spending on equipment. The tech industry is shifting its attention from laptops to tablets, which increases structural demand for flash memory chips (which require their own manufacturing equipment). And growing competition from recent entrants such as US-based Globalfoundries is likely to have kept customers such as Taiwan’s TSMC and UMC on their toes.But the sector, always violently cyclical, has recently seen signs of a downturn in consumer demand, particularly for memory chips used in PCs. There are indications that industrial demand could be slowing too. Texas Instruments expects fourth-quarter revenue to be lower than in the third quarter; meanwhile TSMC expects first-quarter sales to be in a range from flat to 5 per cent lower than this quarter.Chipmakers insist this is a gentle correction that will soon pass. They are certainly spending as though they believe this: ASML, with 70 per cent of the lithography equipment market, has now taken orders worth €1bn or more for four successive quarters – soon to be five. In the last cycle, this only happened for three quarters before demand sank again. The ratio of capital spending to sales is lower than at previous industry tops, but it still looks like the industry is building another cyclical peak for itself.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
90;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-12-08T22:11:39Z;Financials help Wall Street edge higher;Regional banks lead financial sector;Rising bank stocks helped US equity markets edge higher as rising bond yields heralded higher profitability for financials.The S&P 500 financials index added 1.8 per cent, the most among sector components, with Bank of America up 3.7 per cent to $12, Morgan Stanley gaining 3.2 per cent to $26.47 and Goldman Sachsrising 2.8 per cent to $166.14.The rises in regional banks were more pronounced with the sector jumping 3.4 per cent on hopes that lending will become more profitable as US Treasury yields rise.Zions Bancorp added 5.5 per cent to $22.45, Fifth Third Bancorp climbed 6.5 per cent to $13.93, and Regions Financial surged 5.3 per cent to $6.33.Shares in life insurers also advanced after Standard & Poor’s lifted the industry’s outlook from “negative” to “stable”, saying the companies may be able to avoid credit rating downgrades next year after stock and bond sales. Lincoln National Corp jumped 7.5 per cent to $27.24, Hartford Financial Services added 3.5 per cent to $25 and MetLife gained 3.9 per cent to $42.79. AIG sunk 3.9 per cent to $42.23 before trading was halted just before the closing bell.Investors feared dilution when the US Treasury said it plans to sell about one-fifth of the insurer. It was reported that the sale, which would take place in the first half of 2011, could total more than $10bn.The company also struck a deal to repay its Federal Reserve credit line as it seeks independence from the government.The wider market’s gains were limited by the rising dollar and climbing bond yields after Tuesday’s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.Investors tried to gauge what was the primary cause of the rising rates – expectations of stronger economic growth or the resurfacing worries about inflation and the government deficit.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,228.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,372.52 and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.4 per cent at 2,609.16.The materials sector lost 0.9 per cent with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold down 1.8 per cent to $108.60 and Cliffs Natural Resourcesdropping 2 per cent to $71.18.Elsewhere, Fortune Brands – which owns brands ranging from golf balls to Jim Bean whisky – gained 1 per cent to $61.76 after it said it planned to split itself into three separate businesses.The conglomerate will be divided into companies specialising in golf, home products and alcoholic drinks.Details of the plan, which is the result of a four-year strategic review, are expected to be finalised in the next several months.3M edged up 0.6 per cent to $84.05 as analysts weighed up the outlook given by the company on its investor day. On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment. Shares in the mail order online film rental service, which have soared 234 per cent so far this year, sank 0.8 per cent to $188.23.In retail, Home Depot edged higher by 1.4 per cent to $34.03 even though the home improvement retailer increased its full-year profit forecasts.
91;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-11-16T23:38:53Z;Infineon to pay first dividend in 10 years;;Infineon, the German chipmaker, pleased markets on Tuesday as it announced its first dividend payment in a decade, along with a higher fourth-quarter profit margin than expected and plans for a share buy-back.The chipmaker, which has struggled with associations of poor corporate governance and low shareholder performance, said on Tuesday it would pay investors a dividend of €0.10 per share.This will be only the second pay-out since the company floated on the stock market at the height of the internet bubble 10 years ago.The move is the latest in a series of pay-out increases from German industrial companies. BASF, Daimler and Siemenshave pledged substantial dividend rises after a year of rapid sales and profit growth that has overfilled their cash levels.Infineon has this year amassed €1.3bn ($1.8bn) in net cash, which will soon be increased by a further €1bn from the sale of its wireless unit to US rival Intel in early 2011.Peter Bauer, chief executive, said Infineon would from now on aim to pay a regular dividend that would rise or fall with the group’s cash flows.He further pleased investors when he announced plans for a buy-back of up to 10 per cent of the shares.The news sent Infineon’s share price up 5 per cent to €6.27, its highest level in two years.In the fourth quarter, Infineon’s operating margin rose to 18.2 per cent from 15.6 per cent in the previous three months, in line with its own long-term target and higher than analysts polled by Inquiry Financial had expected.Revenues in its three core areas – industrial, automotive and security – rose 55 per cent to €942m year-on-year in the fourth quarter, from €602m last time.Mr Bauer said Infineon, whose chips are used in cars, mobile phones and other electronic devices, expected a cooling-down from October to December, when sales would remain flat or fall slightly compared with the previous three months.He forecast 2011 full-year sales to rise at a rate of “close to 10 per cent” and the operating margin to reach a mid-to-high-teens percentage of sales.Infineon sought state aid in 2009 after the steepest downturn its sector has seen in decades.But it has been catapulted back from the brink this year, as the group profited from rampant demand from carmakers such as Daimler and industrial companies such as former parent company Siemens.Mr Bauer has realigned the company, long known to be a never-ending restructuring case, in the past two years by slashing costs, reducing debt and concentrating it on semiconductors for the car sector, industrial applications and chip cards.He said Infineon would lift its capital expenditure this year by two-thirds to €550m, as the group’s plants were running at full capacity.
92;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-26T20:44:46Z;US steelmakers dragged by weak forecasts;;Losses at AK Steel and US Steel and a strengthening dollar weighed on the materials sector.Materials stocks edged down 0.2 per cent, after falling sharply in early trade, as soaring raw materials costs and a sluggish economic recovery hit steel industry earnings.Steel companies in September made a round of pre-announcements predicting shortfalls in third-quarter profits, but investors still recoiled after disappointing earnings.AK Steel slumped 4 per cent to $12.84 after it reported a third-quarter net loss. US Steel also posted a net loss and warned that the fourth quarter would be similar because of the uncertain economy in North America and Europe. Its shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $40.85.But Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott said it was not just the steel company’s outlooks, some of which had been priced in, but also the strengthening dollar that was hitting materials stocks.DuPont, the chemical maker, lost 1 per cent to $47.22 even though it beat analyst expectations on profits and sales and raised its full-year forecast.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,185.64, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1 per cent to close at 11,169.46 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,497.29.Stocks pared their losses after data showed consumer confidence rebounded from a seven-month low in October and IBM announced extra money for share repurchases.Technology stocks had fallen in early trading, dragged down by a weak forecast from Texas Instruments, but the sector reversed and was up 0.1 per cent after the IBM board authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs.Shares in IBM edged up 0.6 per cent to $140.67 and, as one of the stocks with the largest market capitalisations, that helped the broader indices erase their losses.Chipmaker Texas Instruments slid 0.4 per cent to $28.88 after it warned that its fourth-quarter revenues would be hurt by slowing demand for chips for computers and televisions.In the third quarter, Texas Instruments beat expectations on revenue and earnings.But Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said investors should pay attention to the reduction in lead times for chips which he said could indicate a drop in future order rates. He compared the current decline in lead times with a fall in 2003-04, which came before a dip in order rates.In industrials, Cummins sank 5.8 per cent to $89.00 after it reported a large rise in quarterly profit, beating expectations, but missing analysts’ sales forecasts.The conglomerate also raised its guidance for the full year on the back of strong international sales of its engines and power-generation products.Ford Motor also beat expectations with its record-breaking quarterly earnings as it persuaded US consumers to buy European-style smaller cars and benefited from a rebound in sales of pick-up trucks.The carmaker said it expected to slash debt in its automotive business by the end of the year. Its shares advanced 1.5 per cent to $14.36.In pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen reported their earnings. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced better-than-expected earnings before the opening bell.Lower taxes and cost cuts boosted profits but revenues disappointed investors because of weak sales of Abilify, its schizophrenia treatment, which has been the company’s growth driver in recent years, as well as the costs of US healthcare reform. The shares lost 1.1 per cent to $26.86.AmGen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, slid after its sales came in weaker than expected. The shares were down 1.2 per cent to $57.26 after sales of Prolia, its new osteoporosis drug, were only a third of what analysts had projected.Outside of earnings news, the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.1 per cent after house prices fell in August compared to the month before, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 cities.
93;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-17T19:34:33Z;Bandit phone king has the last laugh;;When Tsai Ming-kai walks into the conference room, it is hard not to feel a slight sense of disappointment. The kindly 60-year-old hardly looks like the ominous-sounding “King of the Bandit Phones” – an epithet that Taiwan’s easily excitable press has given the chairman and chief executive of Mediatek, the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips to China.The exaggerated descriptions the press assigns Mr Tsai (which also include “King of Stocks” and “Godfather of Taiwan chip design”) stem partly from the fact that Mr Tsai is rarely seen in public. His appearances are limited to a handful of speeches every year and even the company’s quarterly results conference calls are handled by Yu Mingto, the chief financial officer.Indeed, this is Mr Tsai’s first face-to-face interview with the press in three years – it was nearly derailed by a small crisis the night before when his public relations manager was unable to inform him in advance that a photographer would be present.Workers at Mediatek, however, know a more personable Mr Tsai. One who, despite being a US dollar billionaire according to estimates by Forbes magazine, chats to his staff while lining up for a meal at the company canteen. Yu Mingto describes Mr Tsai as “a very fact-driven person”, but points out how, at critical junctures for the company such as during last year’s industry downturn, Mr Tsai had shown his softer side by sending encouraging letters to employees.That aspect of Mr Tsai’s personality begins to shine through shortly after the interview begins. As he launches into his favourite topic – management theory and strategy – a beaming smile breaks out across his face.“I never properly went to business school,” he declares. “I took one week off to attend a course on innovation and strategy at Stanford Business School.”It was there that Mr Tsai came into contact with the teachings of Harvard’s Clayton Christensen, Peter Drucker and other management gurus. “That was 10 years ago.”At the time, Mediatek was three years old and was just entering the mobile phone industry. Most of its customers were small family-owned factories in southern China, many of which where making cheap knock-off phones – thus earning Mr Tsai his “King of the Bandit Phones” nickname.Mr Tsai, who was educated in electrical engineering first in Taiwan and later in the US, joined United Micro­electronics, one of Taiwan’s earliest and biggest chip companies, in 1983. He climbed through the ranks, and by 1994 was in charge of United Micro­electronics’ consumer and multimedia product businesses, which made chips for products such as televisions and disc players.The unit was eventually spun off by United Microelectronics, becoming Mediatek and listing on the Taiwan stock exchange in 1997 – with Mr Tsai remaining at the helm and becoming both chairman and chief executive.Despite his short course at Stanford, Mr Tsai became deeply impressed with Prof Christensen’s teachings, particularly those that concerned how newcomers can use disruptive technology to unseat existing market leaders.Mediatek’s subsequent development and rise to become one of the world’s biggest chip design companies could essentially be viewed as Mr Tsai putting Prof Christensen’s theories into practice.His enthusiasm for management theory was such that, even though Mr Tsai has nearly always rejected invitations for public appearances, for three years he wrote a monthly column in Business Today, one of Taiwan’s more popular business magazines, about technology trends and business management.One of Prof Christensen’s theories declared that, although industries tend to be vertically integrated in their early days, they disintegrate into specialised segments once technology becomes more mature, with the process creating opportunities for newcomers to compete against incumbents.In the technology sector, this meant that a small, new company such as Mediatek could survive and thrive just by focusing on doing one thing well, and doing it as cheaply as possible. Mediatek started with CD drives for computers, and quickly moved on to chips for DVD players. By 2000, it had become one of the biggest suppliers of chips for both those markets and Mr Tsai began looking to mobile phones.Brands including Motorola had only started outsourcing their manufacturing to Taiwanese companies a few years earlier, but based on his then newly acquired management theories, Mr Tsai believed that process would only accelerate.While much of the outsourcing of technology manufacturing went to Taiwan in the 1980s, Mr Tsai saw that China was quickly growing into the world’s factory for even high-tech good such as mobile phones. “Taiwan was able to grab that opportunity in the 1980s, but by the consumer electronics era [in the 1990s] . . . all the manufacturing had already gone to Shenzhen [in southern China],” he says.So while the biggest players in the wireless chip industry – Qualcomm and Texas Instruments of the US – were focused on pioneering the third-generation phone chips that power advanced smartphones, Mr Tsai worked on improving the regular, or second-generation (2G) mobile phone chips to service the “newcomers” in China that he foresaw would one day unseat the industry leaders. “Actually there was still room for technological improvement [in 2G phone chips],” Mr Tsai explains.CK Cheng, an analyst with CLSA in Taipei, says Mr Tsai’s breakthrough was in offering not just a chip, but a so-called “turnkey solution” that included reference designs that made it possible for new phone makers to get into the business. “The innovation was not so much the technology but the business model. It brought down the barrier of entry significantly,” Mr Cheng says. “Mr Tsai was the first to do that and it was a turning point for the Chinese mobile phone industry.”Sure enough, while Taiwanese and western phone makers shunned Mediatek’s chips, Mr Tsai found a horde of eager customers in China’s budding phone makers. Using Mediatek’s technology, thousands of Chinese phone makers have combined to take about 20 per cent of the world’s biggest mobile phone market, to the chagrin of established brands such as Nokia and Samsung.It was a shame, Mr Tsai says, that the phones made by his Chinese clients came to be known as shanzai, or bandit, phones. “They were foolish to call themselves shanzai. They should have just stuck with ‘whitebox’, because then people used their name to criticise them,” he says.Instead, he says, cheap Chinese phone makers, and by extension Mediatek, embodies the process by which technology is brought from rich developed markets to the rest of the world living on much lower incomes.“When technology is developed it inevitably serves those who can afford it, so the value created by leading technology is to serve those whose annual consumption power of is, say $5,000 or $10,000,” Mr Tsai says. By relentlessly improving existing technology to reduce costs, “this serves a population that is a much bigger proportion of the world”.“If the financial crisis has confirmed one thing it is that emerging countries were almost not affected. Their economic development will continue and the opportunities there will be bigger,” he says.As well as being a keen student of the management theories that have underpinned Mediatek’s growth, Mr Tsai’s other big hobby is reading history books. Mediatek is now trying to repeat the history of its own feat with 2G phones by bringing prices down on more advanced 3G smartphones.But Mr Tsai already has his eyes on a new management theory: reverse innovation, a process whereby goods developed as inexpensive models to meet the needs of emerging markets are repurposed as low-cost products for western consumers.The idea makes sense, Mr Tsai says, “because the emerging economies are a big market with billions of consumers, but what they need are low-cost, affordable solutions. This forces you to innovate.”
94;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-14T17:13:13Z;Intel ready to close the gap on rivals;;Intel issued a clear warning this week that it intends to be a leading player in tablets, a category where its microprocessors have so far failed to figure.The world’s biggest chipmaker has so far been happy to defend its dominant position in netbooks with its Atom processor, while biding time for the tablet market to mature.But weakness in netbooks in the third quarter and fears that sales could be cannibalised by tablets has brought Paul Otellini, chief executive, off the fence.In pointed remarks during Tuesday’s analyst conference call covering Intel’s quarterly earnings, Mr Otellini said he wanted to respond to “the big question on everybody’s minds” of how Intel would respond to its lack of a presence in tablets. He congratulated Apple on inventing the category and predicted tablets would expand the computer market just as netbooks had done.This fitted with his forecasts earlier this year that tablets would be “additive” rather than taking away from other PC sales, but this time he went on to admit that tablets could impact some PC sales.“At the margin, they probably will. Consumers will have a limited amount of discretionary income and some will choose to purchase a tablet instead of upgrading an existing PC or purchasing a netbook in any given period,” he said.But in the long run, tablets would help grow the overall PC market, he insisted. “At Intel, we are going to utilise all of the assets that are at our disposal to win this segment,” he said, adding that Intel was working with partners on tablets running Windows, Android and its own MeeGo operating system.However, Intel is unlikely to dominate in tablets in the same way it has taken over the netbook category.AMD, its closest rival, is launching its Ontario platform, a low-power chip competitor to Atom, next year. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia also competes here with its Tegra processor.Both could win customers manufacturing 10-inch tablets, which could run Windows and serve as netbook replacements. Tablets, with screens of about seven inches, are seen more as enlarged smartphones. Makers may favour Arm-based chips from established smartphone suppliers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.This category of chipmakers are moving into e-readers and tablets after the failure of the smartbook category, which attempted to combine a netbook’s features with the long battery life, connectivity and always-on state of a smartphone.
95;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-13T22:44:05Z;CBOE to launch electronic options market;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options-trading venue, said on Wednesday it plans to launch a new, all-electronic exchange on October 29. It will be the US’s ninth options exchange.C2, the new exchange, represents the CBOE’s attempt to attract a bigger slice of the high-frequency securities trading market. It will be based in New York, to enable the fastest access for firms based there, and will use “maker-taker” pricing, a model adopted from the equities market in which trading firms get paid rebates for “making” liquidity and customers are charged for “taking” liquidity.“Maker-taker” is markedly different from the “payment for order flow” system used at the CBOE, in which customers trade free, but market-makers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.The new exchange will enter an already crowded and fragmented market in which options exchanges hotly contest every fraction of market share. Since several electronic exchanges already use “maker-taker” fees, some critics charge C2 will bring nothing new to the market.However, the CBOE could significantly grow the electronic options market if it were to introduce trading options on SPX, the S&P 500 index, a hugely popular proprietary product now principally traded on the floor in Chicago.CBOE said C2 would begin on its first day with options on Ford and within the first week would roll out trading on AT&T, Merck, McDonald’s, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and exchange traded funds on the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts, PowerShares QQQ Trust and iShares Russell 2000 index.The exchange said C2 would be “capable” of listing exclusive products such as SPX, and said “plans for those products [are] expected to be announced at a later date”.It said that more than 30 firms had already connected or were in the process of connecting to C2. Market-makers would pay $5,000 a month to access the exchange while regular trading access would cost $1,000 per month.The International Securities Exchange, an all-electronic exchange owned by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, that is one of the CBOE’s fiercest rivals, has also said it is considering launching a second exchange. Both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX operate two US options exchanges.The CBOE has filed a petition for a “declaratory judgment” from an Illinois federal court in an attempt to pre-empt litigation from the ISE that could re-ignite a five-year-old case in which the ISE sued the CBOE, claiming the Chicago-based company had infringed on its patent for an automated order-matching system. That case is not yet resolved.The CBOE said on Wednesday that it did not know when a decision would come in its request for a judgment, but that the issue would not delay the launch of C2 as planned.
96;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Win Phone 7 is Qualcomm lock, no TI, Intel;;Microsoft and Intel’s close bonds on the operating system and processor that dominate PCs became known as the Wintel partnership, but Wincomm is now the name of the game on mobile phones.All nine Windows Phone 7 smartphones announced globally on Monday will run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets and the two companies are making much of the exclusivity.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, led off a video of partners discussing the merits of Windows Phone 7 at the New York launch event.His counterpart at Microsoft Steve Ballmer features in a video on Qualcomm’s website.A Qualcomm blog post states: “Our relationship has never been stronger, and we are excited to help Microsoft bring a new generation of handsets to market, all featuring Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile processors.”The coup for Qualcomm is not good news for Texas Instruments, which has been strongly represented in smartphones such as the Palm Pre and Motorola Droid.Its Omap 3 processor was chosen by Samsung for its Omnia Windows phone, but the new Omnia 7 will feature the Snapdragon processor.This could be because TI’s latest Omap 4 processor is arriving this quarter, just a little too late for the initial Windows Phone 7 lineup, but Qualcomm does have a lock on the category now that could be hard to break.As for Intel, this is another cold shoulder for its “Moorestown” Atom chip, unveiled in May but without a major phone to its name to date.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said at its Intel Developer Forum last month that there would be announcements of a couple of major phones next year, but the chipmaker faces an uphill struggle against the established Arm-based chips of Qualcomm and TI.
97;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-05T20:47:21Z;US stocks rally on Bank of Japan’s QE policy;;US equities jumped to their highest since mid-May after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to ease monetary policy and better-than-expected data on the US services sector sparked hopes of a speedier global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,160.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.8 per cent to close at 10,944.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent higher at 2,399.83.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rallied more than 1 per cent with six soaring more than 2 per cent, led by the materials and industrials indices.The Bank of Japan said that it was considering creating a Y5,000bn ($59.7bn) fund to buy assets to increase liquidity in the financial system, and lowered its interest rate.Some investors hoped this might open the door for the Federal Reserve to extend its own programme of quantitative easing.Shares rose further after a report showed the US services sector was re-bounding faster than ex-pected.But the positive data made Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, question whether the Fed would be prepared to intervene.“Both the headline and the details of the non-manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index came in better than expected and as a result the pressure on the Fed to execute QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] has been reduced,” he said.“QE2 is very data dependant because the way to convince the dissenters is for the data to come in weaker than expected.”The index rose to 53.2 in September, compared with the average economist forecast of 52.Materials and industrials sectors were lifted by hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, advancing 2.8 per cent with Dow Chemical adding 3.6 per cent to $28.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.5 per cent to $91.18 and Newmont Mining rising 1.5 per cent to $63.67.The industrials sector was up 2.7 per cent with Caterpillar climbing 2.8 per cent to $79.40 and Cummins rising 2.8 per cent to $92.24.In energy stocks, Chevron rose 2.6 per cent to $83.39 after the oil company said it plans to resume its share buy-back programme this quarter, repurchasing up to $1bn of stock.Financials also rose, up 2.4 per cent, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase said banks were likely to beat the third quarter profit estimates, even though many other analysts have recently raised concerns about their earnings.Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.56, Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.13 and JPMorgan Chase added 1.8 per cent to $39.64.Information technology stocks added 1.9 per cent with PC maker Dell rising 3.9 per cent to $13.40 after Steve Schuckenbrock, the head of its large enterprise business, said it was seeing good demand for new personal computers in offices.Texas Instruments soared 4.1 per cent to $28.33, Google jumped 3 per cent to $538.23 and Apple rose 3.7 per cent to $288.94.Although the earnings season officially kicks off with Alcoa’s results on Thursday, some companies were already updating the market on their performance in the last quarter.Fertiliser maker Mosaic missed expectations with its first-quarter earnings in spite of tripling profits as sales of its products surged 50 per cent. Earnings were 67 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 71 cents. But the shares still rose 3.4 per cent to $60.80.Talbots, the women’s clothing chain, sunk 14.6 per cent to $10.71 after it forecast third-quarter sales would fall. It had previously predicted a rise in sales in the third quarter, but now sees a decline, because the number of customers passing through the doors has been “inconsistent”.The company predicts earnings per share for the quarter of between 22 and 28 cents compared with the average estimate of 27 cents. But for the full year, the retailer still sees a 1 per cent rise in sales and earnings per share of between 84 and 92 cents.MaxLinear also lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to no more than $18.6m, when the average estimate was $20.3m.Shares plummeted 11.7 per cent to $10.03.
98;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-10-05T17:16:39Z;Cheap bonds help fuel share buy-back rebound;Groups exploit attractive relative cost of debt to equity;"Are companies starting to turn the dial away from bondholders and towards shareholders?It is a question investors and analysts are increasingly asking as the cheapness of debt and relative costliness of equity gives companies big opportunities. Some groups such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are already exploiting what UBS is calling the most attractive relative cost of debt-to-equity in 30 years by issuing bonds in order to buy back shares.“We think we are at a tipping point in terms of corporate behaviour. Companies have been deleveraging and have got ample cash on their balance sheets: we believe we are at the start of the process where the focus will shift back to shareholders,” says Sunil Kapadia, global asset allocation strategist at UBS.With equities still an unfashionable asset class for most investors and companies hoarding record amounts of cash, investors are urging companies to take the matter into their own hands and take action to prop up their own valuations. “I can’t see investors changing their minds any time soon so in a way it has been left up to companies to step in and act as asset allocators,” says Robert Buckland, equity strategist at Citi.One side of the coin is the well-known cheapness of issuing bonds. Microsoft set a new record last month when it issued three-year debt with a coupon of just 0.875 per cent. On the flip side is the relatively high cost of equity. Comparing the free cash flow yield of stocks and shares against the yield for US Treasuries, Citi analysts found that the difference between the two has become positive in the past few years in both the US and Europe.That gives companies an enticing arbitrage opportunity between the cost of debt and equity. The question is: how many of them will take it on? Mr Buckland says: “If you can borrow money in the corporate bond market at 3 or 4 per cent and buy cash flow in equity markets at 7 per cent, then you have got a 3 or 4 per cent carry. Some companies are going to take this on.”Evidence is already building that many companies are prepared to do this as share buy-back activity starts to rebound after plummeting last year.Data from Birinyi Associates, a research group, shows that in the second quarter of this year executed buy-backs – those that actually happened compared with those that were merely announced – rose to $85bn in the US. That is back where buy-backs were in the middle of 2005, although this is still a long way off the peak of $228bn reached in the third quarter of 2007.Mark Bamford, head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital, says: “We are seeing a number of companies exploring the idea of accessing the debt capital markets to retire more expensive equity capital.” Few are willing to make the connection explicitly but companies such as McDonald’s and HP have issued debt and made buy-back announcements close to each other recently.UBS calls this phenomenon “releveraging”. Mr Kapadia says: “Companies and investors should use the currency of cheap credit to unlock equity valuations. There is a huge incentive for companies to leverage again given this valuation gap.”Analysts at Citi see it as part of a broader trend, to which they give the particularly ugly name of “de-equitisation”. In essence, this looks at the total number of shares in issue and whether this number is rising or not. Rights issues or flotations cause shares in issue to rise whereas buy-backs and acquisitions cause this number to fall. Citi even argues that increased dividends should be seen as part of its “de-equitisation” trend as it is the preferred form of returning capital for many investors.BHP Billiton’s $39bn hostile bid for Potash is a good example of potential de-equitisation. If this deal were to proceed, BHP would issue no equity but would finance itself entirely through bank loans and bonds. Heath Jansen at Citi estimates that these current funding costs are less than 2 per cent and would rise only to 3-4 per cent as a bridge loan is replaced by long-term corporate bonds.Citi recommends looking at strong companies that face persistent takeover speculation such as Anadarko, or Capital One in the US, or ITV and Prudential in the UK; or groups that have consistent policies on buy-backs such as Akzo Nobel, BASF, Lockheed Martin or Texas Instruments; or businesses with a high dividend yield and a history of increasing it such as Deutsche Börse, Vivendi, Altria and Qwest.But while many see a clear trend towards deleveraging as – post the crisis – companies finally start to favour shareholders over bondholders, some bankers are sceptical. “It is very cynical to view providing balanced returns to shareholders as bad for bondholders,” says Larry Wieseneck, head of global finance at Barclays Capital. “Hoarding cash is not so good either: shareholders get very nervous, and bondholders should get even more nervous.”Perhaps the most intriguing part about de-equitisation is the suggestion from some that it could have helped J apanese companies as deflation took hold in the 1990s, with some arguing that it could have helped prop up share prices. With a persistent fear of deflation still in western countries, it gives companies more food for thought. “If there is one country in the world where the de-equitisation trade has made sense for 13-14 years it is Japan,” Mr Buckland says. “De-equitisation would have done a world of good to Japanese stock markets.”"

The sector was up 0.5 per cent after earnings, reported after the closing bell on Thursday, pointed to a recovery in corporate spending on information technology.Oracle climbed 8.4 per cent to $27.48 after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly profit. The company said sales in the current quarter would be at least $8.4bn, above analysts’ estimates.Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, rose 0.5 per cent to $46.72 after it beat expectations on both quarterly sales and profit.Shares in Research in Motion have fallen 31.4 per cent so far this year on the back of concerns that the BlackBerry handset could be squeezed out by the rise of Apple’s iPhone and potential bans in countries from Abu Dhabi to India.Also in technology, Texas Instruments boosted its quarterly dividend and said it would repurchase $7.5bn of its stock in another round of buy-backs. Its shares rose 3 per cent to $25.72.Elsewhere, shares in meat-processing companies fell after the price of corn, which is used to feed animals, rose to its highest level in two years.Shares in Tyson Foods dropped 6.9 per cent to $15.85 and Smithfield Foods slid 2.5 per cent to $16.34.In materials, US-listed shares in steel company ArcelorMittal rose 1 per cent to $32.83 after it said it would meet its third-quarter forecasts, even though many of its rivals have reduced projections.But some companies lowered their forecasts with Massey Energy retreating 7.5 per cent to $29.94 after the coal producer projected an operating loss for its third quarter and said it expected its 2010 results to come in at the lower end of its predictions.In deal news, Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare product group, said it planned to offer $2.3bn for the shares that it does not own in Dutch companyCrucell.The two groups already have a partnership to develop flu vaccines and therapies. The deal, which has been recommended by Crucell’s board, values the company at €24.75 a share, a 58 per cent premium on Thursday’s closing price.US-listed shares in Crucell jumped 55.9 per cent to $32.02 and J&J nudged up 0.5 per cent to $61.57.Investors snapped up shares in SouFun, the operator of a Chinese real estate website, pushing it up 72.9 per cent to $73.50 in its first day of trading.

ACS, already the largest shareholder in Hochtief with 29.9 per cent, was widely thought to be putting in a low bid to comply with German takeover rules that dictate a full offer must be made when a single stake reaches 30 per cent.Assuming the shareholders reject the offer, ACS would be free to carry on buying shares in the market and build up its stake without paying a premium.Shares in ACS were up 3.7 per cent over the week to €36.09 while Hochtief added 9.2 per cent to €61.Carrefour, the world’s second-biggest retailer, enjoyed a strong end to the week after it announced a massive store refurbishment that it estimated to boost operating profit to €5.2bn by 2013, beating analysts’ forecasts by nearly 25 per cent.The plans sparked a series of broker upgrades and shares in Carrefour jumped 6.9 per cent over the week to €40.02.STMicroelectronics, the chipmaker, rose 2.3 per cent on Friday after US rival Texas Instruments raised its dividend and announced a share buy-back, which boosted chip companies across Europe. Over the week, STM was up 1.8 per cent to €5.63 while German chipmaker Infineon gained 7.4 per cent to €4.62 and Dutch group ASML rose 4.6 per cent to €21.80.However, over the week, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 slid 0.8 per cent to 1,072.87.Kuehne & Nagel was prominent on the pan-European index after Credit Suisse published a note on the Swiss freight industry.“We believe that the sea and airfreight markets should return to more normalised growth rates in the second half,” the broker said. “In such an environment, we believe the potential to win market share becomes a key driver for Swiss freight forwarding companies.”K&N rose 5.9 per cent to SFr114.50. Panalpinawas up 4.5 per cent to SFr103.50 on a Credit Suisse upgrade.Deutsche Postbank was among the FTSE Eurofirst’s worst weekly performers as investors took profit following a strong run on the back of an offer from Deutsche Bank. Postbank shares fell 7.9 per cent to €24.89.
101;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-09-16T23:33:34Z;Oracle earnings soothe fears for tech sector;;Oracle eased anxieties in the technology sector with forecast-beating first-quarter earnings as its software business grew strongly in all regions and its hardware arm grew faster than expected.Intel had caused jitters three weeks ago with its warning of a revenue shortfall of about $500m in third-quarter sales as weaker-than-expected demand for consumer computers suggested a stalling recovery.Oracle, in contrast, reported strong sales of its database, storage and server products to its business customers.“Customers are buying from us and are buying more,” said Safra Catz, co-president, referring to Oracle’s growing market share and larger deals in the quarter.In the three months to the end of August, Oracle reported sales of $7.59bn, up 50 per cent on a year earlier and ahead of an analyst consensus of $7.32bn. Earnings of 42 cents a share were up 38 per cent and beat the Wall Street forecast of 37 cents.Oracle shares rose 4 per cent in extended trading in New York to $26.40.Mark Hurd took part in the earnings presentation, despite HP filing a lawsuit this month to try to block its former chief executive from taking up his new role as co-president at Oracle.Mr Hurd, who resigned last month over code of conduct breaches at HP, said he had joined Oracle because of its “clear growth opportunities” and the “sheer size” of its research and development investments, totalling more than $4bn this year.“I don’t believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle,” he said.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said that Oracle would beat its rival SAP to market with “in-memory database” technology, which he had described as “whacko, ridiculous, complete nonsense” when SAP acquired Sybase for $5.8bn in May.“I never said we didn’t believe in in-memory database,” he said on Thursday. “I said I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology.”Mr Ellison said Oracle had also achieved its aim of profitability at Sun Microsystems, which it acquired in January for $7.3bn. “We think we can double the size of [Sun’s server] hardware business and we think we have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors,” he said.●Shares in Texas Instruments rose more than 3 per cent in extended trading after its board approved a $7.5bn share buy-back and a 1 cent rise in its quarterly cash dividend to 13 cents. The chipmaker has reduced the number of its shares by 31 per cent over the past six years through repurchases.
102;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-09-10T20:49:27Z;S&P 500 climbs but gains are muted;;US stocks edged higher after a sharp rise in wholesale inventories boosted consumer discretionary stocks and the energy sector benefited from a higher oil price.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,109.56 on Friday and was higher by 0.5 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent, at 10,462.84, and was higher by 0.1 per cent on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,232.17, nudging up 0.4 per cent over the week.The rise over the week was hampered by low trading volumes due to Labor Day and the Jewish new year.But Brad Thompson, managing director and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, said low volumes were not just a problem this week.“Low volumes have been a systemic fact for the whole market in the entire year,” he said. “You have to look at how robust the breadth and depth of the rally and declines are, and weak volume shows there is not a lot of conviction.”On Friday, data showed US wholesale inventories jumped by 1.3 per cent, more than three times the average analyst estimate.The surge, which was the largest rise for two years, shows companies were confident enough to order more stock earlier in the summer. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.9 per cent with Sears, the department store, up 2.9 per cent to $66.80 and homeware retailer Bed Bath & Beyond adding 2.2 per cent to $40.35.Energy shares benefited from the rising price of crude oil after a forced shutdown of the biggest pipeline supplying Canadian oil to Midwest refineries and to a key storage hub in Oklahoma.Chevron advanced 1.9 per cent to $78.82, Halliburton gained 2.2 per cent to $30.88 and National-Oilwell Varco rose 3 per cent to $41.10.But the utilities and information technology sectors weighed on the index.Utilities shares fell 0.8 per cent after PG&E, the owner of California’s largest electricity provider, dropped 8.4 per cent to $44.21.A natural gas explosion on one of PG&E’s lines just outside San Francisco started a fire that reportedly killed four people and destroyed dozens of homes.Some technology shares also fell after chipmakers National Semiconductor Corpand Texas Instruments issued disappointing forecasts and said there was weak demand for personal computers and other devices that used microchips. The semiconductor sector fell 1.4 per cent but the overall S&P 500 information technology index was flat.National Semiconductor Corp, which makes chips that control power in electronic devices, forecast sales in the second quarter of up to $415m, below the average estimate. Its shares sank 6.4 per cent to $12.08.Texas Instruments fell 0.6 per cent to $23.70 after it lowered the upper end of its forecast for third-quarter profit and sales to be in line with analysts’ expectations.Earnings are now projected to be between 66 cents and 72 cents per share on revenues of $3.62bn- $3.78bn.Both Dell and Adobe Systemssuffered from downgrades by Morgan Stanley. Dell dropped 2.6 per cent to $12.06 after it was cut from “overweight” to “underweight” because of weak demand for PCs after the rise of the tablet computer.Adobe Systems, which soared on Thursday after Apple said it would relax restrictions on iPhone application developers, retreated 2 per cent to $32.20 after the maker of graphic design programs was cut to “equal weight” from “overweight” by Morgan Stanley.US-listed shares of Nokia advanced 1.8 per cent to $9.94 after it hired a new chief executive from Microsoft. Stephen Elop, formerly head of Microsoft’s business unit, replaces Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who was under fire from some investors.
103;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-09-10T04:07:25Z;Arm’s Eagle chip has soaring performance;;Arm’s unveiling of the capabilities its Cortex-A15 processor design, previously codenamed Eagle, expands the possibilities for Arm-based chips well beyond the mobile phone industry they dominate.The launch in San Francisco on Wednesday night also expanded Arm’s share price in London on Thursday as it rose 4 per cent to a new 52-week peak of 403p – 200 per cent higher than a year ago.The market’s reaction seems a fair reflection of the significance of the launch to Arm. Rivals Intel and AMD ought to be concerned.The chipmakers have been emphasising the quick return on investment that can be achieved from their latest energy-saving server chips, but Arm trumps both with the smaller power demands of its chips and the A15 has the muscle to take them on in the data centre.With HP and Dell present to provide testimonials, Mike Inglis, head of Arm’s processor division, described how the A15 would give five times the performance of Arm’s most powerful mainstream processor design today – the A8, which is found in many high-end smartphones.The A15 is scalable from smartphones to high-end servers. Mr Inglis described dual-core, quad-core and octo-core configurations and processor speeds of 2.5Ghz in a small power envelope. There is support for virtualisation, memory support up to 1 terabyte and advanced error correction for data integrity.Texas Instruments, the first licensee of the design, showed a roadmap of products for the A15 combined with its OMAP platform that led from smartphones to eReaders, smart TVs and home automation. It cited savings of 15 per cent in power and double the performance of the A9 – the Arm design expected to first feature in products this Christmas.It is likely to take two years for the A15 design to work its way through to products on the market, Warren East, Arm chief executive (pictured), cautioned.He told me software and systems would have to be adapted for Arm-based servers as well, although the company’s own website has been powered by Arm server chips for the past year.Intel may have to defend its PC territory from Arm, but, with its Atom chip, it is also attempting to invade the smartphone, smart TV and embedded chip markets where Arm has a strong presence.Mr East said Intel could not match Arm at the other end of the scale where its Cortex-M0 is the company’s smallest, lowest power and most energy efficient processor.“Intel talks about embedded, but they’re talking about something that has three times the number of transistors of the Cortex-A9,” he said.The far smaller M0 design is ideal for simple sensor devices using chips costing $1 or less, but Mr East said the volumes sold of such chips would be “immense”.This explained in part his comments earlier in the evening, when he announced Arm would celebrate its 20th birthday in two months’ time and 20bn Arm-based processors had shipped in that time.“But we’ve barely scratched the surface, we’re really only just getting started,” he said, predicting Arm microprocessors would hit the 100bn mark in the next decade.
104;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-08-31T18:48:25Z;Wireless chipmakers;Intel's takeover of Infineon leaves the market open to disruption;There are still a few billion people left on the planet yet to own a computer. And a large proportion of these unwebbed will get their first taste of processing power from the most personal of computers: smartphones. At the same time mobile phone technology is finding its way into other consumer devices, for example providing books and map updates on the go. No wonder then that Intel, which makes the microprocessors found in four of every five PCs sold globally, this week snapped up the wireless chip business of Germany’s Infineon.Up for grabs is a $30bn annual semiconductor market. While 2010 mobile phone unit sales should be around a tenth higher on last year, the smartphone portion – which contains more valuable silicon – is expanding at three times that rate. As smartphone units replace simpler phones, average selling prices for chipmakers should stay reasonably stable, even as smartphone prices themselves continue to fall. New devices such as e-readers and media tablets are still in the tens of millions range, but such growth is incremental and technologically straightforward to address. Gartner forecasts revenue growth for the mobile application processor market of 22 per cent annually from 2009 to 2014.Production is still relatively dispersed. Qualcomm is the biggest manufacturer, supplying processors for 80 per cent of smartphones using Android, the fastest growing mobile operating system. But Qualcomm only takes 30 per cent of wireless chip market revenues overall, calculates consultancy iSuppli. While the competition has shrunk over the last five years from around 15 suppliers of baseband (a phone’s internal modem) to five which count, the market is still open to distruptive innovation.The source of that disruption remains to be seen. Texas Instruments is winding down its baseband business in wireless to concentrate on processors, while Intel is heading in the opposite direction – Infineon’s engineers are expert in cramming several functions onto one chip. It is not hard to understand the appeal.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
105;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
106;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-08-11T23:21:09Z;Cisco shares tumble after results;;Reduced technology spending by big companies around the globe led Cisco Systems, the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, to miss analyst expectations as it reported fourth quarter and annual results.Shares in the bellwether tech group fell more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading.Sales were $10.8bn for the quarter, a record for the company and a 27 per cent increase from the same period a year earlier.But analysts had expected sales of $10.9bn, and viewed the results as further evidence that the global economic recovery was slowing down.“We are seeing a large number of mixed signals in both the market and from our customers’ expectations,” said John Chambers, chief executive.“We think the words ‘unusual uncertainty’ are an accurate description of what is occurring.”Lower than expected sales from Cisco indicate that enterprise spending is contracting after surprisingly brisk growth this year.Cisco’s results follow disappointing figures from IBM and Texas Instruments last month.Cisco reports results a month later than most other technology companies, and as a result is considered a bellwether for the industry and the broader economy.Wednesday’s results are the first that cover the entire month of July, and are likely to send a chill through Wall Street. Mr Chambers said that Cisco and its customers, which include most of the world’s governments and largest companies, remain cautious about the pace of the global economic recovery.“The Federal Reserve’s comments yesterday that the pace and output of the recovery has slowed in recent months, and that the recovery is likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated just a few months ago, are comments that most of our large customers that I have talked with recently would agree with,” Mr Chambers said.This is the third straight quarter of growth for Cisco after revenue fell for four consecutive quarters during the recession.Net income rose 79 per cent from $1.1bn to $1.9bn in the quarter, and net income for the full fiscal year was up 27 per cent to $7.8bn.The company, based in San Jose, California, is growing fast thanks to international demand from businesses handling record volumes of internet and video traffic.“Whether the global economy continues to show mixed signals or not, the strength of our financial model and profit generation serves us well,” said Mr Chambers.But Cisco warned that there are “some challenges that are contributing to an unusual amount of conservatism and even caution” as it looks ahead. In spite of these concerns, Mr Chambers still predicted revenue growth of 18 per cent next quarter.
107;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-08-11T21:16:33Z;Sustainable profits still elude SMIC;;Semiconductor Manufacturing International will need up to another year to achieve sustainable profits, China’s largest contract chipmaker by capacity said on Wednesday.The company, which once saw itself as a beacon for China’s ambitions to build a semiconductor industry, on Wednesday recorded a quarterly profit for the first time in three years.However, the remarks by David Wang, chief executive, are likely to add to investor doubts about the chances of a turnround for the company, which has struggled over the decade since its establishment.SMIC has not had a full year of profits since 2004, the year of its stock market listing, and is embarking on an effort to restructure, which has crippled its operations.The company reported a $96m net profit for the second quarter, its first since the first quarter of 2007, and said revenue rose 45 per cent from a year earlier to $381.1m. But it said both the profit and part of the revenue rise were due to accounting changes.SMIC’s troubles are emblematic of the broader sector problems. Born out of a push by Beijing in the mid-1990s, China’s semiconductor industry is spread over many cities as a result of competing local government incentives for fabrication plants.In addition, a lack of cutting-edge technology has forced many new entrants into contract manufacturing, a segment that requires increasingly huge investments in ever more expensive fabs.The chipmaker plans to increase capacity at its fabrication plants in Shanghai, Tianjin and Beijing. “With that capacity, which is expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2011, and with a utilisation rate of 90 per cent or more, we will be able to achieve sustainable profitability,” Mr Wang said.He added: “We are dedicated to transforming this into a new company, focused on sustainable profitability.”Richard Chang, the company’s founder, built a scattering of fabs across China, with some funded by local authorities and operated by SMIC, taking advantage of the ambitions of Chinese local governments.But while that strategy was intended to avoid huge capital investments, it instead meant that SMIC’s individual fabs lacked the scale of nimbler, more cost-effective competitors.Mr Chang was replaced by Mr Wang in November last year following the settling of a long-running intellectual property rights dispute with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, under which TSMC gained $200m and a 10 per cent stake in SMIC.With Mr Wang at the helm, SMIC has moved to streamline capacity, changing how it runs two fabs in central China owned by local governments there.SMIC now takes orders and revenues from customers directly and outsources production to the fabs. Previously, local government partners received payments from customers and SMIC received a fee for managing the factories.That move was a driving factor behind the rise in the chipmaker’s revenues, but SMIC’s preferred option would be to end alliances with local governments altogether.With the two fabs, which account for 4.6 per cent of SMIC’s revenue, still weighing on its gross margin, SMIC is now hoping they can be sold.Mr Wang said Texas Instruments was negotiating with the Chengdu local government to take over its fab there. “If they sign, we’re off the hook,” Mr Wang said.SMIC has said it aims to spend $700m-$750m this year in its switch to more concentrated capacity in fewer locations. While analysts support the strategy, they have concerns about how the company will finance it.“There is a risk that this new round of spending is coming at almost the exact wrong time and may saddle the company with excess capacity in the next downturn,” said Steven Pelayo, head of Asia Technology Research at HSBC, in a recent note.Datang, the state-owned technology company that helped bail SMIC out by taking a stake last year, plans to invest another $100m, pending approval by shareholders next month.
108;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Cheer over earnings props up shares;But the euro retreats and 2-year Treasuries yields hit new low;"Tuesday 22:10 BST. Traders hold steady as investors are steeled by mostly positive earnings, though still veered away from taking on substantial risk by the fallout from European fiscal difficulties.The FTSE All-World equity index reversed its losses and was up 0.5 per cent, but the dollar bounced off near 10-week lows as its haven attraction trumps concerns about the US economy. The euro was also in retreat and US 2-year Treasury yields hit a new low.Gains appear likely to continue: After the close there was an anticipated agreement by BP to sell $7bn in assets to Apache; that will give backbone to those cheering a potential return of the bid premium to shares. And Apple, which has been going through a rare spell as a laggard, reported stronger-than-expected earnings on the back of brisk sales of iPads and iPhone 4 devices.But the trigger for the session’s early slide appeared to be news highlighting how the stretched budgets of many European nations, and the austerity drives designed to combat them, will place strains on financial systems and negatively affect the corporate sector.The UK’s fiscal situation came into focus following a profit warning from UK-listed telecoms group Cable & Wireless Worldwide. That brought home to investors how the slashing of government spending can hurt company earnings. News that the UK government’s borrowing in June was the highest on record for that month only serves to highlight the extent of cuts to come.In the US, the first substantially negative earnings report, from Goldman Sachs, knocked back sentiment early, as the S&P 500 opened nearly 1.5 per cent lower. However, growing revenues and earnings at IBM and Texas Instruments, plus earnings-forecast beating perormances by PepsiCo and UnitedHealth Group, attracted bargain seekers.Even Goldman Sachs, still the leading trading franchise on Wall Street, was higher later in the session as bargain hunters swooped in. The S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent.“The company reports we’ve had so far are inconsistent with the double dip concerns that the markets have been pricing in,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.Yet many of the earnings reports contained notes of caution – notably forecast cuts by Johnson & Johnson and Tupperware, plus below-expectation business sales growth at IBM – that did little to dispel fears that the economy was slowing. Such is the worry about the US and global economy potentially slipping backwards, that some analysts see the Federal Reserve needing to consider further monetary stimuli.Indeed, Mr Schweitzer cautioned: “The strength of corporate profits is what leads me to expect that business hiring and capital spending will improve in the coming months, but it’s not going to be an overnight recovery. There are just too many negatives out there.”In addition, a poorly-received auction of three-month bills by Hungary showed investors are getting increasingly nervous about the stand-off between Budapest and the IMF/EU over the extent of the austerity package relating to the receipt of a €20bn loan. That has hurt the region’s banking stocks, which are seen having significant exposures to eastern european debt.Sales today of debt by Ireland, Spain and Greece have gone fairly well, but then the ECB stands as a backstop for such “peripheral” sovereigns. A six-year UK gilt auction was more of a struggle. US Treasury bonds saw buying in spite of shares rallying after housing starts were said to slow 5 per cent in June (though permits for future potential building did offer some hope).This only highlights the difficulties investors – and governments– know they face in trying to assess a patchwork global economy and thus the markets’ prospects in the medium term.Just north of the border, the Canadian central bank raised interest rates for the second time in six weeks – from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent – as it seeks to normalise policy as activity rebounds.The move shows that areas of strength persist, a point highlighted today by the Asian Development Bank which, while acknowledging that issues such as the sovereign debt crisis had made the environment more uncertain, raised growth forecasts for most economies in the region.At the same time, Australia and Brazil are struggling over whether to slow their growth or keep their foot on the accelerator. The Australian dollar was higher on speculation of another rate hike, while Brazil’s real was lower (and its stocks higher) after a report showing a more moderate pace of inflation growth led traders to conclude that another rate hike was not necessarily imminent.New US housing data were also received with confusion. New construction was down 5 per cent June, leading homebuilding shares to initially tumble. But shares later rallied as markets focussed on a sub-data point showing permits for future building to be on the rise.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index added 0.2 per cent, shrugging off worries about US growth and the poorly-received results overnight from IBM and TI. S&P 500 futures had fallen nearly 1 per cent after the bell in New York following those results, but by the time the Asian session drew to a close the contract had pared losses as investors in the region took a more phlegmatic view of corporate prospects.Shanghai sported its second consecutive good advance, rising 2.2 per cent as traders welcomed signs of currency liberalisation by Beijing. Hong Kong climbed 0.9 per cent, though Tokyo fell 1.2 per cent as Japan played catch-up after being closed for a holiday on Monday.● Europe. Bourses initially responded to Wall Street’s rebound overnight and saw decent gains from the off. However, the austerity worries took their toll as the session progressed and falls accelerated after the Goldman earnings hit the wires.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was only fractionally higher even though miners did well. Banks, which were modestly higher as investors reasoned that the outcome of the eurozone stress tests due on Friday will restore confidence to the sector, faltered later on.The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.2 per cent, led lower by telecoms.● Forex. The dollar rebounded as equities slid. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, was up 0.3 per cent.The euro had earlier reclaimed the $1.30 mark, but the renewed fiscal worries, profit taking and haven trades left the single currency down 0.4 per cent at $1.2891.Notably, the euro seemed to ignore early rumours, based on reports in Spanish media, that all of Spain’s caja savings banks passed the stress tests. That news, if true, could go either way with traders. Either it means that Spain’s troubled lenders are healthier than expected, or that the stress tests were not stressful enough.● Debt. The market faced a deluge of sales, with Spain, Ireland, Greece and the UK auctioning debt of various duration. Eurozone auctions had been considered pretty successful of late, so any disappointing sale could have hit sentiment.Spain, for example, sold €4.3bn of 12-month bills and €1.7bn of 18-month bills, and though the bid-to-cover ratios were slightly lower than seen for an auction last month, so were the yields demanded, a sign of easing investor stress. Spanish 10-year benchmark yields are down 7 basis points at 4.33 per cent.US Treasuries enjoyed demand as traders seek havens. The 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 2.95 per cent, while the 2-year note earlier hit a new all-time low of 0.5764 per cent. In late trading it had flattened out to 0.5845 per cent.● Commodities. The complex managed a stoic performance given the bond market’s flight from risk. This may partly be the result of the complex’s correlation to sentiment emerging from China, where stocks had another good day. Copper was up 2.7 per cent at $3.01 a pound in New York trading. Oil reversed an early slide, rising 1.2 per cent to $77.44 a barrel, helping to push the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index up 0.1 per cent.Gold was up 0.8 per cent at $1,191 an ounce, having hit a fresh two-month intra-day low of $1,175."

The S&P 500 Financials sector rose 1.2 per cent.Goldman Sachs shares fell in early trade, but by the close they had climbed 2.3 per cent to $149. The bank announced its earnings before the opening, with second quarter profit dropping 83 per cent and missing analysts estimates.Shares suffered in early trade after second-quarter results released after the bell on Monday night from IBM and Texas Instruments. The companies reported quarterly revenues that fell shy of expectations. IBM shed 2.5 per cent to $126.55 after it reported a fall in new technology services contracts. Revenues rose 2 per cent to £23.7bn, but missed the average analyst estimate of $24.2bn.Texas Instruments, the second-biggest US chipmaker, also missed second quarter revenue estimates, caused by weaker-than-expected orders from one mobile phone customer. Its shares were down 3 per cent at $24.78.After the closing bell on Tuesday, Apple announced a a 78 per cent jump in third-quarter profit after shoppers flocked to buy the iPad and the latest iPhone. The better-than-expected figures pushed shares 3.2 per cent higher in after-hours trading to $260.In contrast, Yahoo, also reporting after hours, disappointed with sales of $1.13bn, as it faced increased competition fro online advertising. Its shares were 2.6 per cent lower at $14.80.

The broader Topix index shed 1 per cent to 832.26.Technology stocks led the retreat after investors responded negatively to quarterly revenue figures from Texas Instruments’ and IBM. Tokyo Electron, the chip equipment manufacturer, fell 2.9 per cent to Y4,680 while components maker TDK shed 2.1 per cent to Y4,995 and Fujitsu lost 1.7 percent to Y581.Other big exporters were hurt by the strength of the yen, which hovered around a seven-month high against the dollar.

111;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-07-19T23:29:56Z;IBM sales to businesses disappoint investors;;"The recovery in business spending on technology, a key driver of broader economic growth, is taking hold more slowly than many investors had hoped, according to quarterly figures released by IBM on Monday.Optimism about a quicker rebound was stoked last week by strong earnings from Intel. The chipmaker put its performance down to demand from
corporate customers, which account for the lion’s share of spending on technology.However, IBM’s revenues grew by only 2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, to $23.7bn, half the rate of growth that most analysts had been expecting. The company’s shares fell 4 per cent in after-market trading.Meanwhile, shares in Texas Instruments dropped 6 per cent, in spite of a 42 per cent bounce in revenue at the second-biggest US chipmaker to $3.5bn. The reaction highlighted the nervous mood on Wall Street, as the company only marginally missed its own recently-raised revenue forecast.IBM, which is often seen as a bellwether of business spending, denied that the figures pointed to any faltering in the recovery, and put most of the shortfall down to the translation effects of a stronger US dollar.There was “certainly not a pull-back in [corporate] spending” during the quarter, said Mark Loughridge, chief financial officer. Growth rates across the company’s businesses, and in all parts of the world, had picked up from the first quarter of the year and showed signs of continuing to improve this quarter as well, he added.Investors were unnerved partly by a 12 per cent decline in the value of new contract signings in IBM’s services division, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of its revenues.IBM executives said they believed that the steady recovery was likely to pick up steam in the second half of this year, helped partly by new product cycles in the hardware division. New mainframe computers and high-end servers due to go on sale in the coming months should lead to accelerating growth in hardware sales, which had been held to only 3 per cent in the latest quarter as customers waited for the new products, said Mr Loughridge.Sam Palmisano, chief executive, said that the hardware products were one of the factors behind a decision to raise IBM’s earnings forecast for 2010 as a whole. The projection was raised to $11.25 a share, close to the $11.27 that most analysts are expecting.Despite the unease over revenues, IBM more than matched profit expectations in the second quarter as it continued to hold down costs and improve profit margins. The 13 per cent increase in earnings per share, to $2.61, made IBM the only company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to increase its earnings every quarter for the past three-and-a-half years, said Mr Loughridge. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of $2.58 a share."
112;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-07-19T21:33:09Z;Wall St rebounds in early trade;;Wall Street opened higher early on Monday, bouncing back from Friday’s drop with renewed optimism ahead of a week of earnings reports.Less than an hour after the opening bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,071.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent to 10,161.77 and the Nasdaq was 0.9 per cent higher at 2,197.77.Ahead of the opening bell, futures were higher as investors took stock of last week’s hefty declines. They shrugged off more disappointing data on the US housing market, which showed that homebuilder confidence fell to its lowest level since April 2009 this month.John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities, said investors were viewing last week’s selling as an overreaction in light of the fact that all but three of the 23 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported since the start of earnings season have beaten analyst forecasts.The second quarter earnings season continued with Halliburton, the oil services company, pushing up 5.5 per cent to $29.01 after it beat expectations, reporting a rise in profit in its second quarter as onshore drilling gains made up for the halt to new wells in the Gulf of Mexico.In contrast, Delta Air Lines fell 9 per cent to $10.67 after the airline’s second quarter revenue came in below expectations. It reported a second-quarter profit compared with a loss for the same period the year before, as the airline was buoyed by a greater demand for travel and higher fares.Elsewhere, McMoRan Exploration Co, the copper miner, recorded a net loss of $21.7m for the second quarter, or 23 cents a share, compared with $100.6m, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. The company’s revenue rose 11 per cent and beat estimates. The stock was down 4.7 per cent at $10.27.Earnings from IBM and Texas Instruments after the closing bell will likely set the tone for the technology sector on Tuesday.Among bluechips, Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, rose 1.8 per cent to $62.99 after it announced an order from Emirates airline for 30 Boeing Co. 777-300ER aircraft, valued at $9.1bn.A couple of deals also boosted sentiment in early trading.Handset maker Motorola’s US-listed shares were up 2 per cent to $7.65 after it agreed to sell its wireless network assets to Nokia Siemens Networks for $1.2bn.Shares in ATC Technology Corporation surged 39.47 per cent to $24.31 after the company agreed to go private in a $512.6m deal.US-listed shares in BP fell 3.8 per cent to $35.69 after it was reported that oil may be seeping from the Macondo well in spite of the newly-installed containment cap holding back most of the leak.Shares in AIG rose 1 per cent to $35.28 after it agreed a $725m settlement with a group of Ohio pension funds to settle a six-year-old class action lawsuit over allegations of securities fraud. The insurance company also appointed Mark Tucker, former head of the UK’s Prudential, executive chairman and chief executive officer of AIA, its Asian arm.
113;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-07-19T21:00:48Z;Earnings provide lift against Europe debt fears;Positive results help stocks and Treasury yields inch higher;Monday 23:00 BST. Traders were cautiously optimistic at the end of the session, pushing risky assets higher as markets struggled for direction throughout a choppy day.The FTSE All-World equity index was down 0.1 per cent, but core bond yields, though still depressed, are slightly higher on the day, and the euro and oil are a bit stronger.Activity in Asian trading was curtailed by Tokyo’s closure for a public holiday, while European markets were beat up following reminders from the periphery that the road to fiscal stability is long and difficult.But the S&P 500 in New York was up 0.6 per cent, buoyed by continued support from company earnings. Halliburton, the oil-services giant, said profits were up 83 per cent, though it warned of future disruptions related to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.Bulls could only do so much, however, restrained by news from the critical housing sector that US homebuilder confidence has hit a 15-month low.”Housing has been and will remain an anchor around the neck of the US economy,” said Tom Porcelli, US market economist at RBC Capital Markets. “Housing tends to lead recoveries and its knock-on effects, like the spending associated with filling those houses, are momentum generators. Our sense is what’s left of this recovery will have to continue with no help from the housing sector.”The second-quarter earnings season now moves into its second week, during which 122 S&P 500 companies will report – tech giants IBM and Texas Instruments reported after the closing bell. Both reported growth in sales and revenue. IBM missed sales expectations, however, though the company said that it was not seeing any slowdown in business spending.But already the feeling is growing that the recent deterioration in macroeconomic data, notably the lack of help from housing, means the forecasts from chief executives of current trading carries ever greater heft than the backward-looking top and bottom lines.And if that hadn’t made investors sufficiently cautious, government budget stress has made an unwelcome return.Hungary’s failure to agree a fiscal strategy with the International Monetary Fund and European Union has revived worries about eurozone exposure to struggling eastern European states, while a Moody’s downgrade of Ireland also reminded investors of the tough battle still being fought even by those seen as more willing to bite the austerity bullet.Friday’s coming revelation of the eurozone bank stress test results can only heighten the anxiety.It should be noted, though, that there are some more wholesome nuggets on which bulls can chew. Philips, the Dutch electronics bellwether, has exceeded earnings expectations and, crucially, raised its margin forecasts. Delta Air Lines missed expectations but still reported growing earnings and revenue on a pick-up in flier demand.The $1.7bn private equity purchase of Healthscope, the Australian hospital chain, and the Nokia Siemens mobile venture’s proposed deal to buy Motorola’s mobile infrastructure assets, are the latest in a line of deals that illustrate the improved health of capital markets and show that value can be discerned by some operators.Overall, however, relatively low volumes, with traders still a bit too anxious – the Vix index of US market volatility was still elevated, at 26 – to put on big positions, have left markets searching for direction. Correlation between risky assets and stock sectors has not been strong. That’s likely to be a theme for the summer.● Forex. The euro retreated from its recent highs following the Ireland downgrade and news out of Budapest. The wave of buying pushing up the single currency of late supported it. The euro rose 0.1 per cent versus the dollar to $1.2946.That could be interpreted as showing that forex traders are more concerned about the relative economic health of the US against the eurozone – as illustrated by a narrowing of bond yield differentials. However, the safe-haven impulse prevailed, as the dollar index, measuring the buck against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, was up 0.1 per cent.But the fact that the euro was up 0.4 per cent against the yen to Y112.40 – a cross that would be expected in more cautious times to move lower – suggests traders were becoming somewhat inured to tales of eurozone woe. For the time being, at least.The Hungarian forint is down 2.6 per cent versus the euro since Friday’s close.● Debt. Credit traders appear more worried about the eurozone’s fiscal condition than their currency cousins. Spreads for sovereign debt considered more likely to default are widening. Credit default swaps – which track the cost of insuring debt against non-payment – are higher. Moody’s downgrade of Ireland has pushed CDS on Dublin’s debt up 17 basis points to 265 basis points, according to Markit. Hungarian CDS are up 55 basis points at 377 basis points.The more timid mood is helping keep Treasury yields near recent lows. The 10-year US note, nevertheless, made a more decisive late move, up 5 basis point at 2.97 per cent.● Europe. Bourses tracked Wall Street’s extra losses and opened lower. A pick-up in S&P 500 futures, the euro’s stoic display and some bid chatter then saw stocks move into positive territory, before relapsing again. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is down 0.6 per cent. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.2 per cent, with BP again proving a drag, but miners reversed the negative sentiment towards the sector seen in Asia.Dublin fell 1 per cent and Budapest lost 2.9 per cent on the Moody’s and IMF news respectively.● Commodities. In choppy trading oil was up 0.6 per cent at $76.49 as traders prepare to switch over to the new September contract.Metals were mostly higher following heavy falls last week but this is not sufficient to keep the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index in the black. The benchmark was down 0.4 per cent.Gold was down 0.7 per cent at $1,184 an ounce, having earlier hit a two-month low of $1,177 with traders citing the removal of risk premium – though that appeared contradictory to the broad trend elsewhere.● Asia. The FTSE-Asia Pacific index fell 0.9 per cent as the region absorbed the sharp fall in New York at the end of last week and fretted about the impact on exports of a struggling US consumer. Sydney, in particular, suffered from those lower growth fears, with miners in the cross-hairs. The S&P/ASX 200 closed down 1.5 per cent.However, falls were tempered among later-closing markets after Shanghai put in a strong afternoon performance as soothing comments about policy and economic prospects from premier Wen Jiabao encouraged “bargain” hunting. The CSI was up 2.1 per cent, helping Hong Kong to trim its losses to 0.8 per cent.

We’re probably going to have a pretty decent earnings season, but earnings are going to be driven by cost reductions, rather than top-line growth.”Until there is an improvement in the labour market, corporate revenues will struggle to grow, he added.At the close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,078.75.

The cap could still take several days to install.The company is also reported to be in talks with Apache on a deal to sell stakes in its Alaska operations. Shares in Apache were down 3.2 per cent to $85.07. ExxonMobil rose 0.3 per cent to $58.94 amid speculation that the company may be considering a bid for BP.Johnson & Johnson lost 0.6 per cent to $60.21 as the consumer products company said it would buy Micrus Endovascular for about $480m to expand its portfolio of medical devices that treat strokes. It represents a premium of about 5.5 per cent to Friday’s closing price of $22.19. The company expects the deal to be “slightly dilutive” to full-year earnings per share. Shares in Micrus were up 4.5 per cent to $23.19.Weyerhaeuser was the session’s best performer as the stock rallied 8.4 per cent to $38.86. The timberland and forest products company declared a special dividend worth a combined $5.6bn. The pay-out to shareholders is part of its plan to convert to a real estate investment trust.Financial services stocks were mixed ahead of a number of banks reporting their second-quarter earnings later in the week.Bank of America and Citigroup, both of which report second-quarter earnings on Friday, climbed 0.7 per cent higher to $15.21 and 1.7 per cent to $4.11 respectively. Playboy surged 40.9 per cent to $5.55 as Hugh Hefner, its founder, offered to buy all the shares he does not own to take it private, in a deal that values the company at around $185m.Mr Hefner has offered $5.50 a share in cash, a premium of about 40 per cent to its $3.94 closing price on Friday. He already owns about 69.5 per cent of the class A common stock and 27.7 per cent of its class B stock.Qualcomm advanced 3.5 per cent to $35.10 as Goldman Sachs added the phone chipmaker to its “conviction buy list”, citing accelerating smartphone sales growth.Rival chipmaker Texas Instruments improved 1.1 per cent to $24.75, while Fairchild Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $9.27.Marriott International, the hotel chain, was down 0.6 per cent to $30.97 as the stock was downgraded to “market perform” from “outperform” by Jeffrey Donnelly at Wells Fargo Securities.Shares in Paychex, a provider of payroll and human resources services, was down 2 per cent to $25.75 as Jonathan Judge, the company’s chief executive, resigned to pursue other interests.
115;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-06-24T01:47:29Z;Imagination more than trebles profits;;Imagination Technologies, the graphics chip designer, more than trebled full-year pre-tax profits thanks to strong demand for its technology in products such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad.The company said it was seeing demand from makers of netbooks, tablets and set-top boxes, which need graphics chips for their increasingly sophisticated multimedia displays.Pre-tax profits rose to £10.2m in the year to the end of April, from £2.7m last time.Earnings per share increased from 3.7p to 6p.Hossein Yassaie, chief executive, said the company was on track for 200m devices using its semiconductor designs to be shipped this year.Some 500m devices a year could be shipping within a few years, as smartphones come to dominate the handset market. Imagination earns about 30 cents of royalty per chip.Revenue rose 26 per cent to £80.9m. However, the numbers just missed market expectations, heightened by the recent successful launch of the iPad.Earlier this week Apple revealed that more than 3m iPads had been sold, less than three months after launch.Shares in Imagination, which have nearly trebled in value over the past year, slipped 5p to close at 295p.Imagination provides designs to chip companies such as Intel, Samsung and Texas Instruments, which in turn supply makers of consumer electronics devices.Intel and Apple both have significant shareholdings in the business and Imagination shares have been driven up 30 per cent in the past quarter on rumours of a takeover bid by Apple.Analysts, however, said such a deal was unlikely.“For the share price momentum to be sustained, Imagination needed to deliver significant upgrades.“It is therefore disappointing to note that Imagination has stuck to its original 200m royalty unit shipment guidance …in spite of the media frenzy around the unit shipments of its key customer’s latest products [Apple iPad and iPhone 4],” said Arun George, analyst at Execution Noble.Analysts are also wary of the increasing competition Imagination faces.That is coming from companies such as Nvidia, the graphics specialist, and Arm Holdings, which has a strong relationship with mobile phone chipmakers, and offers a rival graphic processor design.
116;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-06-09T20:55:20Z;Wall St indices slip despite upbeat Fed;;"US stocks gave up the session’s gains in the last hour of trading on Wednesday to close lower on the day, as investors shrugged off a positive report on Chinese exports as well as the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which said economic activity improved nationwide last month.China’s exports rose about 50 per cent and new loans totalled Rmb630bn ($92.3bn) last month over the prior year, Reuters reported.“The number is substantially better than the 32 per cent growth expected in
an economists’ survey,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. “[It] is being interpreted by the markets thus far today as [an] indication that slowing in Europe will not be as detrimental to growth around the world – particularly in China – as the markets initially had thought.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 1,055.65, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to 9,899.25 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.5 per cent to 2,158.85.US-listed shares in BP fell 15.8 per cent to $29.20, their lowest level since 1996, as pressure grew from US lawmakers on the oil giant grew to suspend its dividends.

117;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-06-06T23:57:52Z;Arm chief cautious on tablet PCs;;The head of the company whose chip designs are running the iPad has cautioned it is “too early to tell” whether tablet PCs will be a big part of the market for mobile devices, despite Apple’s initial success.“It’s an interesting market. What we have to be very careful of is projecting just how big that particular part of the market is going to be, because it’s very early days since any of these tablets have been on the market,” Tudor Brown, president of UK-based technology group Arm, told the Financial Times at the Computex trade show in Taiwan.Mr Brown, who is also one of Arm’s founders, said the growing popularity of cloud computing services over the next few years would undoubtedly create a huge market for internet-connected devices.This would appear to be a boon for Arm, whose architecture for low-powered semiconductors already powers more than 95 per cent of the world’s mobile phones and is now pushing to bring its chips to a host of other devices including cameras and televisions.However, Mr Brown cautioned against getting carried away with the success of the iPad. “We’re actually into a period of experimentation at the market level, and I’m expecting to see a range of devices …maybe we’ll see more tablets, different user interfaces, and different ways people are going to use them. But from where I’m sitting right now I think it’s too early to make wild predictions.”Mr Brown’s caution may be partly explained by Arm’s unsuccessful attempt last year to bring its chips to the traditional PC markets with so-called “smart books”. Smart books are cheap laptop computers that have long battery life and constant internet connectivity because they run on low-power Arm chips and a Linux-based operating system, such as Google’s Android.While dozens of prototype smart book models were the focus of last year’s Computex and the Consumer Electronics Show at Las Vegas this year, device makers were never really sold on the concept and few became actual products.Arm last week joined forces with IBM and chip companies Freescale, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments to create Linaro, a company that will accelerate the development of Linux software for devices such as mobile phones, tablet computers and digital TVs.
118;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-06-03T12:04:04Z;IBM joins chipmakers to boost Linux platform;;IBM has joined forces with chip companies Arm, Freescale, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments, to create a company that will accelerate the development of Linux software for devices such as mobile phones, tablet computers and digital televisions.The move is a challenge to Intel and Microsoft, which are looking to move beyond their dominance of the personal computing market to take a large share of the mobile phone and hybrid device market.Arm-based chips are used in more than 95 per cent of the world’s mobile phones and also power Apple’s iPad tablet. However, Intel is developing smaller, more power efficient, Atom chips which could also be used for these kinds of devices.Intel’s big advantage is that Microsoft’s Windows operating system, which is familiar to most computer users, does not work well on Arm-based devices. Consumers have so far preferred netbooks running on an Intel and Windows-based system.Arm has been pushing Microsoft to adapt Windows to run over its chip architecture, but without success. Now it appears that it and the other chipmakers, who all use the Arm architecture, are fighting back by strengthening Linux, the open source operating system that is a rival to Microsoft’s Windows.Linaro, the new company formed by the alliance, aims to simplify the development process for Linux. One of the problems of Linux is that there are multiple versions of the system, which can be confusing for hardware manufacturers. Operating systems such as Google’s Android and Chrome, MeeGo and Palm’s WebOS are all different variants based on the Linux system.There are also multiple variations of the Arm architecture, with each chipmaker putting their own individual tweaks on the chips. The complexity of this ecosystem is a turn-off particularly for computer and laptop manufacturers, who are used to working with the much simpler Intel and Windows combination.“We had a lot of feedback from manufacturers that they really wanted to use Arm chips but the complexity was a challenge. Most of them are coming from an Intel environment where you don’t have all those variants,” said Ben Cade, co-chief executive of Linaro. “We got a lot of feedback to say: ‘Help us speed up the adoption process’.”Linaro’s goal is to ensure that the latest software can be quickly ready to put on the latest silicon chips, shortening the time it takes to make new smart phones, tablets, digital televisions and other devices.“The existence of Linaro will significantly simplify the process of making Linux-based consumer devices available to market,” said Jane Silber, chief executive of Canonical.Linaro will be a non-profit company, and will be backed by investment in the “tens of millions” from members of the alliance.The first software and tools from Linaro are due to be released in November. Additional companies are expected to join the alliance.
119;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-05-05T09:44:05Z;Smartphone boost for CSR and Wolfson;;UK semiconductor companies CSR and Wolfson both beat expectations for first-quarter sales on Wednesday, as their chips won spots inside a range of new smartphones designed to compete with Apple’s iPhone.CSR, which has dominated the market for Bluetooth chips said it had won its first Wi-fi chip deal with a leading handset maker, and added a new GPS customer. The company more than doubled sales and returned to a profit in the first three months of the year.At Wolfson, which makes audio chips, losses widened, but Mike Hickey, chief executive, hinted that the company could return to the black by the end of the year. Sales rose 13 per cent.The results follow strong results last week from Broadcom and Texas Instruments, showing that demand across the chip industry is improving.Neither CSR nor Wolfson chips have featured in Apple’s new iPhone or iPad, but they are winning business with Apple’s competitors, such as Samsung and LG. Samsung has said it aims to treble smartphone shipments this year, while LG intends to launch about 10 phones based on the Android operating system.Wolfson, which provides the audio chips for Samsung’s Wave phone, for example, said it its chips had been selected for a leading manufacturer’s new Windows Mobile phone, as well as in another leading smartphone manufacturer.Such deals are starting to help Wolfson make up for the loss of Apple as its biggest customer last year. The company announced a raft of 250 design wins last year, which are now beginning to translate into revenues. It had another 90 design wins in the first quarter.“As more of these design-ins reach full production during the year, we expect our revenues to increase, leaving us well placed to return to sustainable profitability,” Mr Hickey said.Sales rose 13 per cent to $28.5m, ahead of market expectations of $25.7m. Pre-tax losses widened to $6.9m from $4.7m last time. Mr Hickey said revenues in the second quarter would be in the range of $30m to $35m.At CSR, sales more than doubled to $173m, at the top end of expectations, and the company returned to a profit of $4.4m, compared with a $22.6m loss last year. CSR forecast a sequential increase in revenue this quarter to between $210m and $225m, ahead of market consensus.Confidence in CSR was dented recently by revelations that, like Wolfson, the company’s chips were not included in the Apple iPad tablet computer, although Apple has never been a big customer for the company. CSR is also suffering from the fact that Nokia, a key customer that the company has recently won back, has delayed the launch of its range of new smartphones.However demand from emerging markets – with the GPS chips included in smartphones such as the Ophone in China – are helping to offset these effects.“We are no longer dependent on a single technology or one customer,” said Joep van Beurden, chief executive. “The growth of GPS, demand from the Bric countries, growth of demand from the automotive sector, together these all give confidence. We are firing on all cylinders now.”Shares in CSR, which have risen more than 60 per cent in the past year, rose 3.57 per cent to 435p in early trade.Shares in Wolfson, which have risen around 45 per cent in the last three months, fell 2.5 per cent to 165.5p.

its second-quarter forecasts above average analyst estimates.The company said demand for its products was strong in all product segments and it was seeing growth in every region.Walmart, the largest corporate employer in the US, was flat at $54.04 after a gender discrimination lawsuit against the company was affirmed as a class action by a federal appeals court, creating one of the largest such suits in history.Bailed-out insurer AIG dived 16 per cent to $37.37 following a downgrade to “underperform” from “market perform” with a 12-month target price of $6 at KBW.Office Depot slumped 21.1 per cent to $7.06 as it reported disappointing first-quarter results and forecast a second-quarter loss. The office products and services supplier said same-store sales in North America fell 1 per cent.Department store chain Macy’s declined 3.8 per cent to $23.91 in spite of it raising its full-year revenues and profit guidance, citing higher consumer spending.It said it expected same-store sales to rise between 3 and 3.5 per cent compared with its prior estimates of growth between 1 and 2
per cent.McGraw-Hill, a publisher of textbooks that also owns the Standard & Poor’s credit ratings agency, moved back 0.7 per cent to $33.65 even after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, boosted by S&P’s strong performance.First-quarter earnings per share across the company were 33 cents compared with 20 cents per share a year earlier and average analyst estimates of 25 cents.AK Steel fell 8.2 per cent to $17.43 after it revised downwards shipment forecasts for the year, citing a slower rate of US housing starts than it had expected previously.Rival US Steel was down 5.7 per cent to $56.63."
121;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-04-26T22:40:35Z;Texas Instruments’ investments pay off;;Texas Instruments said on Monday that its investments in new manufacturing capacity through the downturn were paying off, with record first-quarter results.The second largest US chipmaker announced that profits grew from just $17m a year ago, in the depths of the recession, to $658m. Revenues rose 54 per cent to $3.21bn.TI and its bigger rival Intel have maintained their own manufacturing facilities while other US chipmakers have turned to contract manufacturers and Asian foundries.“TI invested in new manufacturing capacity for both wafer fabs and assembly/test facilities during the downturn in 2009. The strategic investments we’ve made over the years are delivering strong growth and market share gains,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive.Earnings per share rose from 1 cent to 52 cents. The results beat Wall Street expectations of 51 cents a share on revenues of $3.13bn. TI shares rose 0.6 per cent to $27.33 in extended trading on the news in New York.TI has lost its position as the leading wireless chipmaker to Qualcomm, but has been focusing on analog and embedded markets in recent years.Analog revenues grew 70 per cent year-on-year to $1.37bn, compared with 27 per cent growth in wireless to $717m.“This was the fourth quarter of excellent sequential increases, with the combined revenue of our analog and embedded processing businesses setting a new record level,” said Mr Templeton.Maintaining the upbeat outlook of chipmakers during the current earnings season, the Dallas-based company said momentum was continuing into the second quarter as demand for its products were strong.Production output was at an all-time high. More manufacturing capacity was being added to support customers, including the industry’s first analog facility on 300-millimetre diameter discs.Higher utilisation rates of its chipmaking equipment had been a major factor in boosting operating profit from $10m to $950m.Other revenues grew 68 per cent due to strength in its calculator and DLP business, which powers displays in TVs and projectors.The chipmaker expects second-quarter revenues to be between $3.31bn and $3.59bn for earnings per share in the range of 56 to 64 cents. This is ahead of analyst forecasts of revenues of $3.23bn creating profits of 53 cents a share, according to a Bloomberg survey.

125;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-02-10T16:19:04Z;Gesture-ready smartphones on the way;;Attendees at the high-nerd-quotient International Solid-State Circuits Conference in San Francisco this week have been getting a sexy preview of what’s in store at the more mainstream Mobile World Congress phone show in Barcelona next week.Texas Instruments has been showing how phones will have gesture capabilities as they take advantage of more powerful processors such as TI’s forthcoming Omap 4.Touchscreens are the current interface du jour but Greg Delagi, TI’s Wireless senior vice president, has been demonstrating how software and an inexpensive 2-megapixel camera in a phone can recognise gestures such as waving to scroll the screen, select items, go back and even pinch and zoom photos.He told me games could also benefit with gestures enabling players to fly an aircraft for example without touching the screen.The Omap 4 application processor was announced at last year’s show but this year will see it in full production and TI is expected to announce details about its capabilities and availability in Barcelona.While Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon 1Ghz processor has garnered a lot of media attention, TI’s current generation Omap 3 has quietly gained significant design wins over the past year.It features in smartphones such as the Palm Pre, the Samsung Omnia with its HD playback capabilities, the Sony Ericsson Satio – the first with a 12-megapixel camera, the Nokia N900 and Motorola’s Droid.TI has also just announced WiLink 7 – a chip that combines GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM radio on a single chip. Its DLP technology has enabled pioneering pico projectors embedded in mobile phones from Samsung and LG.The Dallas-based chipmaker has resisted following other wireless chipmakers in competing with Intel to supply processors for low-end notebook PCs.But Mr Delagi said it was interested in looking beyond smartphones “where there is a value proposition.”He cited eReaders – TI announced at CES its Omap processor could increase page turns from 8,000 to 15,000 before the battery on an E Ink-based eReader was drained, screens would be refreshed faster and video capability could be added.“But you can’t go everywhere, you have to bring your customers some kind of value in terms of better battery life, higher performance, being able to do new things or taking cost out of the system,” he said.
126;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Arm beats expectations but expresses caution;;Warren East, chief executive of Arm, believes the semiconductor industry may be over-optimistic about prospects for growth for 2010, despite the Cambridge-based chip designer beating analysts’ expectations with strong fourth-quarter results.Mr East forecast just 13 per cent growth for Arm, with the rest of the industry expanding at a slower pace. This is in sharp contrast to many analysts’ expectations that the industry will increase sales by 15-20 per cent this year.The chip industry has begun to recover from a slump in 2009 as recession-hit consumers stopped spending on gadgets. Positive results from semiconductor companies such as Intel, Texas Instruments and Infineon have boosted sentiment in the sector.However, Mr East said that macro-economic factors could slow down growth later this year, as the US and European countries moved to reduce their fiscal deficits. “I can’t understand how consumers will feel better off with that backdrop,” Mr East said.The caution came in spite of a strong performance from Arm, which has defied the downturn, thanks to the popularity of smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone. Arm-designed chips are in more than 90 per cent of the mobile phones sold globally, and smartphones are particularly lucrative, containing up to six royalty generating chips per handset. Smartphone sales rose 30 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter to 53m phones, according to Strategy Analytics, a research company.Although fourth-quarter revenue was down 10 per cent from last year at £85.2m, it were ahead of expectations and better than the 20 per cent declines seen by chip sector peers. Full-year sales were up 2 per cent at £305m, but on a dollar basis, annual revenue fell 10 per cent. Full-year pre-tax profits were down 25 per cent to £47.3m, while earnings per share fell 9 per cent to 3.1p. The annual dividend is raised 10 per cent to 2.42p via a 1.45p final. The shares rose 10.5p to 200.3p.“2009 as a whole was a challenging year for the semiconductor industry but despite pressure on our customers’ R&D budgets during the year, demand for Arm’s processor and physical IP technology from industry leaders remains strong,” said Tim Score, chief financial officer.“Licensing was driven by the desire of our customers to design more Arm technology into an increasingly broad range of end-market applications with mobile computing, smart phones, and micro controllers being particularly prominent.”While smartphones and mobile computing devices account for the bulk of revenues – via royalty licence payments – new licensing agreements have seen a rise in demand for non-mobile applications. Of the 25 licence agreements Arm concluded in the fourth quarter, 19 are related to products such as cars and printers.Most of the full-year decline in pre-tax profit was caused by an increase in the group’s R&D costs.“The dollar has been stronger during the year which drives up the sterling costs…so a lot of that is driven by [foreign] exchange,” said Mr Score.“But of course Arm is about 60 per cent R&D development engineers so a lot of that increase comes in the R&D line, because what we’ve been doing in 2009 – although we’ve been controlling headcount fairly carefully in a fairly difficult trading environment – we have been absolutely focused on investing in the key critical technology developments that drive future licensing and royalties.”Exceptionally strong licensing agreements in the fourth quarter have also boosted Arm’s backlog of orders to their highest ever level, up 20 per cent on the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenues from this backlog will gradually be recognised over the coming two to three years.
127;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-01-28T01:41:04Z;STMicro sees strong chip sector recovery;;Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of ST Microelectronics, said Europe’s largest chipmaker would return to pre-financial crisis levels of revenue this year, thanks to a strong recovery in the semiconductor market.Mr Bozotti said he expected global chip sales to grow 10 to 12 per cent this year, echoing similarly bullish forecasts from US rivals such as Intel and Texas Instruments. All three companies have announced improved earnings, confirming that the chip industry is shaking off the downturn.“What we are seeing is a strong recovery. It started in Asia, particularly China, but is now global. Demand is higher than we can respond to. I don’t think this level of demand can be sustained – there is some speculation as customers rebuild inventories. But underlying that I believe there is a real trend for growth,” Mr Bozotti said.The comments came after STMicro said sales rose nearly 14 per cent to $2.58bn (€1.84bn, £1.59bn) in the fourth quarter, higher than expected. Fourth quarter losses narrowed to $70m from $366m a year earlier, although these were higher than analysts had expected, due to restructuring charges.Mr Bozotti said that revenues in the first quarter of 2010 would decrease 7 to 13 per cent from the previous three months. However, such a decline is relatively small for what is usually the quietest and shortest quarter of the year, and implies continued recovery.He said the company was planning to increase its share of the global market from the 6.5 per cent this year by launching new products, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes used for the motion-sensing functions in consumer devices such as games controllers and iPhones.STMicro has also been making efforts to slim down its unwieldy cost structure, spinning off its loss-making memory chip operations, and rolling its under-sized wireless semiconductor business into a joint venture with Ericsson. The ST Ericsson joint venture has made heavy losses since it was set up nearly a year ago, but has undertaken several rounds of restructuring to try to reach profitability.Mr Bozotti said STMicro remained committed to supporting ST Ericsson if the joint venture needed a further cash injection. He expects ST Ericsson to start showing strong growth in 2011.The wireless segment is the only one of ST Micro’s divisions not to see strong growth in the fourth quarter. Sales of chips to the consumer and automotive industries increased 17 per cent quarter-on-quarter.Meanwhile, sales of chips to the industrial market rose 23 per cent quarter-on-quarter thanks to strong sales of smartcards, microcontrollers and power supplies.Sales for 2009 were $8.51bn, down 13.5 per cent from the $9.84bn the previous year, reflecting a dramatic fall in chip demand in the first half of 2009, which brought factory production lines to a standstill.Net losses were $1.131bn compared with $786m the same time last year. Losses per share widened more than 46 per cent to $1.29.Shares in ST Microelectronics, which have gained nearly 40 per cent in value over the last year, fell 4.39 per cent to €5.83 on Wednesday.
128;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-01-26T01:21:36Z;TI upbeat as healthy profits return;;Texas Instruments on Monday recorded its best level of profitability in two years as US chipmakers continued to report a strong rebound from the recession.The second largest US semiconductor manufacturer followed its bigger rival Intel in also issuing an upbeat assessment for the opening months of 2010.“Our outlook for the first quarter reflects the likelihood of sequential growth instead of the typical seasonal decline,” said Rich Templeton, TI chairman.The Dallas-based chipmaker beat Wall Street expectations for its fourth quarter, with revenues of $3bn and profits of $655m, or 52 cents per share. Analysts had expected sales of $2.98bn and profits of 50 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey.For the first quarter, it forecast revenues and profit ranges with midpoints of $3.07bn and earnings per share of 48 cents, compared to Wall Street expectations of $2.83bn and 44 cents.TI said this would represent a 2 per cent growth in sales when they were usually seasonally down by around 5 per cent.Operating margins in the fourth quarter were 29.1 per cent of revenues.For the year, TI reported revenues fell 17 per cent on 2008 to $10.43bn and profts were down 23 per cent at $1.47bn.“The last time we approached this level of profitability was the fourth quarter of 2007 when TI’s operating margin was 28 per cent,” Kevin March, chief financial officer, told analysts in a conference call.Mr March said the results reflected TI’s shift in focus towards analogue chips.TI still makes a wider range of chips compared to Intel’s focus on PC microprocessors. Their use across a number of industries means TI’s sales can give a broader picture of the economic situation.The company said that revenues for analogue chips were up 27 per cent and embedded chips were up 21 per cent on a year ago, with the recovering automotive sector showing strong growth as.Wireless chip sales for mobile phones were up 13 per cent and other chips, including those for calculators, TVs and projectors, were up 17 per cent.TI said demand was solid and customer and channel inventories were lean.Geographically, while growth compared to the third quarter was faster in US and European markets, all regions grew.TI shares have risen 58 per cent in the past year but were down 1.4 per cent at $23.35 in extended trading on Monday.Intel reported earlier this month that its revenue growth was almost double the norm in the fourth quarter, with strength across all regions and all product categories.Qualcomm, the leading wireless chipmaker, reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday.www.ft.com/technology
129;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-01-25T21:36:28Z;Calm returns to markets after US sell-off;Wall Street bounces as focus returns to earnings;21:25 GMT. A calmer mood prevailed in markets on Monday as the slew of concerns that precipitated Wall Street’s three-day 5 per cent stumble appeared to dissipate, prompting a tentative return to riskier assets.“A fresh look at the world of finance after a weekend of reflection has apparently inspired investors to cast off much of the bearishness that left Wall Street in tatters at the close of last week,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The S&P 500 in New York rose 0.5 per cent to 1,097, with some analysts arguing the sharp declines from last Tuesday’s 15-month high had left stocks primed for at least a technical bounce.“The market, has very quickly become near term oversold,” said Christopher Verrone at Strategas. “The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the oversold 30 level and the New York Stock Exchange put/call ratio is currently greater than 1. Over the last 12 months, sharp rallies have often followed extreme oversold readings on the RSI.”Worries linger about what ultimate impact President Barack Obama’s crackdown on investment banks may have on the sector, although investors’ fears that similar proposals may be adopted in the other leading financial centres appear to have eased.In addition, though the fiscal difficulties facing the eurozone periphery persist, investors were heartened by strong demand for a sale of Greek sovereign debt.And it seems that the US Federal Reserve will not now have to jettison its pilot just as it needs to navigate a potentially treacherous policy shift. Reports from Washington over the weekend suggest Ben Bernanke will be reappointed Fed chairman for another four-year term. It had not looked good for him on Friday and this had further rattled a market ripe for a wobble after closing at fresh 15-month highs last Tuesday.Traders expect no change in the main interest rate when the Fed delivers its decision on monetary policy on Wednesday. However, the market knows it is getting closer to the time when the language of the Fed’s accompanying statement has to be altered to prepare investors for tightening in the months ahead as the US economy improves. The reaction to any change to the view that rates will stay low for an “extended period” may tell us whether the market is able to absorb this shift.In the meantime, with little in the way of economic data on Monday, traders once again focused on the US fourth-quarter earnings season. Texas Instruments and tech-maverick Apple lead the way and will deliver their reports after the closing bell.● The FTSE World equity index was down 0.1 per cent as gains in the US failed to offset weakness in Asia. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo finished down 0.7 per cent at four-week low, while the Shanghai Composite, China’s benchmark, lost 1.1 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.6 per cent, with financials again weak.Europe started softer but pared most of those losses as banks rebounded and the US futures pointed to a decent bounce, only to dip again following weaker than expected US housing statistics. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 per cent.The Vix index, Wall Street’s measure of expected equity market volatility – which had jumped 55 per cent between last Wednesday and the close on Friday – fell 6.9 per cent to 25.4 as traders became less fearful.● Trading was quiet in the currency markets. The dollar, which had suffered at the end of last week on the Obama plan and Bernanke worries, was slightly weaker, down 0.1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.● Gold took advantage of the relative stability in the dollar, gaining 0.5 per cent to $1,098 an ounce. Oil rose 0.8 per cent to $75.12 a barrel. A poll by Reuters showed analysts expect US traded crude to average $77.50 in 2010 and $84.60 in 2011.● The calmer tone to markets saw traders pull away from havens. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose 1 basis point to 3.62 per cent.Greek bond yields pulled back as worries about default eased a touch. The yield spread with German Bunds fell back below 300 basis points after hitting a record high above 310 basis points last week. Worries that Greece would struggle to raise financing to fund its huge fiscal deficit were salved somewhat by news that its first bond issue of the year attracted strong demand. €20bn was offered for the initial €5bn sale, suggesting the interest Greece will have to offer may be a touch lower than may otherwise have been the case if demand had been poor.The Athens stock market rose 2.8 per cent.
130;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-01-25T13:10:06Z;Tech stocks in focus ahead of Apple numbers;;The technology and consumer electronics sectors were in the spotlight ahead of quarterly results from Apple and Texas Instruments due on Monday, kickstarting a week of earnings announcements within the sector.Apple shares gained 4.5 per cent to $202.22 while Texas Instruments rose 1.5 per cent to $23.45. The earnings reports are due after close of trade in New York.The closely watched numbers are to be published just days after Google’s revenue figures failed to live up to expectations, leading to pressure on technology shares. Google shares lost 1 per cent to $545 as trading in New York opened – they have now fallen 13 per cent since the start of the year.However, Frederick Grieb, analyst at Credit Suisse, said he expected Microsoft, which is to announce numbers on Thursday, to report positive earnings after the latest personal computer shipment data revealed “demand has improved and that inventory levels have normalised”. Microsoft added 1.1 per cent to $29.26.Intel, which posted strong 2009 results two weeks ago, benefited from an increase in demand for personal computers and servers. Analysts said the company’s future revenues should improve after stronger demand for the Windows 7 operating system, as well as the introduction of chips that combine microprocessing and a memory controller with graphics capability. Intel advanced 1.5 per cent $20.19.In Europe, Dutch conglomerate Philips, known for making items from shavers to beauty products, reported better-than-forecast quarterly core operating profit, pushing its shares up 5.6 per cent to €21.47. Emerging-market growth for its consumer lifestyle and lighting units boosted the company’s results.Swedish telecoms group Ericsson posted a sharper-than-expected fall in quarterly sales. The world’s top mobile equipment maker said that network sales had been hurt by the downturn but it did see operating profit almost reaching forecasts after curbing spending. Ericsson shares lost 2.2 per cent to SKr 70.25.Although an improving global economy means the outlook for the market has brightened, few expect a strong rebound and some analysts say growth could be delayed until 2011.France’s Alcatel-Lucent thinks the market will be flat or grow about 5 per cent at best, while Nokia Siemens Networks forecasts no growth. Alcatel fell 0.2 per cent to €1.47 while Nokia weakened 0.8 per cent to €9.15. China’s Huawei, now in second place to Ericsson, has gained ground on the companies’ home territory in recent months, securing deals to build next-generation networks in Norway and Sweden.Meanwhile, German electronic chip-maker Infineon advanced 2.2 per cent to €3.85 as UBS kept the companies neutral rating. “Infineon has already raised guidance for its FQ1 results, now expecting high single-digit growth in group revenue quarter on quarter,” said Anuj Krishan analyst at UBS.“Infineon cited industrial and autos as the main drivers but we also feel that wireless industry device units are running ahead of expectations, leading further support.”Citigroup downgraded a handful of chip equipment makers, including US small caps Advanced Energy Industries and Brooks Automation, on concerns over inventory overbuilds. Advanced Energy edged up 0.3 per cent to $14.77 while Brooks rose 2.3 per cent to $9.23.Tokyo Electron, the world’s second-largest maker of chip-producing equipment, slipped 0.9 per cent to Y5,720 despite saying on Friday that it would resume construction of a plant in northern Japan as it sees a recovery in the market.
131;TXN;Texas Instruments;2010-01-10T22:51:53Z;IQE plans a year in the spotlight;;Motor racing fans may have regarded the final grand prix of last year in Abu Dhabi as a damp squib but it was a heaven-sent publicity opportunity for Drew Nelson, IQE chief executive.With Britain’s Jenson Button already crowned champion, for some the main highlight of the night race was the ever-changing light emitting diode (LED) facade covering the hotel overlooking the new track.As one of south Wales’ best-known entrepreneurs, Mr Nelson is placing a lot of faith in the technology. The lights at the Yas Marina in Abu Dhabi were made by Enfis, where Mr Nelson has taken the temporary non-executive chairmanship role. But the LED market also forms one point of a three-pronged attack for IQE in 2010 on three of the world’s fastest growing technology markets: smartphones, semiconductor-based lighting and solar energy.“We’re looking for a strong acceleration in these markets in 2010,” says Mr Nelson. Phil Rasmussen, chief financial officer, agrees. “We see more opportunities than threats at the moment.”Paul Cornelius, an analyst at FinnCap, agrees that a new supercycle of compound semiconductors is emerging in the chip industry, saying: “If you really want to play the supercycle, you have to go back to the raw materials.”In this case, the raw materials are IQE’s compound semiconductor wafers, which use gallium arsenide (GaAs) instead of silicon.They allow chipmakers to squeeze out extra performance in wireless devices, LEDs and solar cells. For example, a 3G Apple iPhone contains four GaAs wafers, whereas an older 2.5G phone would contain only two.Analysts at Noble Securities expect Cardiff-based IQE to make earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £8.5m from revenues of £54m in the year to December 31, down from revenues of £60.5m and earnings of £8.4m last year.Yet the figures mask a sluggish start to 2009, followed by a rapid upturn in the second quarter as demand for smartphones and netbooks boosted earnings. Since March’s low, the stock became one of the best performers, rising from a low of 3p to 20p. It closed at 18¾p on Friday, valuing the company at £83m.Yet, as befits a company that has been around for more than 20 years, some analysts remain concerned that it could always be a case of “jam tomorrow”.“I expect to upgrade (2010 figures) more substantially after the trading update,” says Arun George, an analyst at Noble. “But investors want to see operational leverage and a cut in net debt – from £18.9m at the interim stage – this year.”Most analysts are happy about global buoyancy in the smartphone market, which accounted for 76 per cent of IQE’s revenues in the first half. Ahead of Christmas, Texas Instruments upgraded its fourth-quarter guidance while Mario Rivas, chief executive of Anadigics, one of IQE’s customers, told the Financial Times he expected market growth of 20 per cent in 2010.FinnCap’s Mr Cornelius said there was “plenty of room for punchy updates during 2010” for IQE on the back of strong demand.Yet its long-term prospects of becoming a noted player in the global chip market relies on it extending its positions in the solar power and LED markets. Analysts say each business could equal the revenues produced by the wireless divisions by around 2012-2013, but both have hurdles to overcome.Late last year IQE bought NanoGaN, a Bath University spin-out, for its LED technology and appointed NanoGaN founder Professor Wang Nang Wang, a world-leading advanced materials scientist, as IQE’s chief scientific adviser.But perhaps the greatest issue for IQE will come if and when the world’s largest chipmakers start using compound wafers for the majority of their operations.“I can’t imagine that some of the largest chip manufacturers won’t invest $100m in a semiconductor plant,” says Mr Cornelius.
132;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;India: A nation develops;;"Walk into the John F. Welch Technology Centre in Bangalore and you could be forgiven for thinking you have strayed into Q division – the laboratory dedicated to inventing new gadgets – from a James Bond film.In one area of General Electric’s 1m-square-foot research and development centre, named for the company’s former chief executive, scientists are testing a special “pedestrian-safe” bumper bar for cars, which can hit people at speed without maiming them. Elsewhere, boffins are working on locomotive engines that run on methanol extracted from grass growing alongside India’s railway lines, and on super-compact medical equipment that costs a fraction of the price of similar products in the west.Opened in 2000 with 275 scientists and engineers, today the centre employs 4,300 – or one in six of GE’s researcher “technologists” worldwide. This year, this ratio will increase to one in four, according to Guillermo Wille, the centre’s managing director.“Why India? It’s very straightforward,” says the German engineer. “There are few other countries where you can hire such large numbers of engineers so quickly. China is comparable but after that, nothing comes close.”Bangalore is well known for its vast outsourcing sector, in which armies of twentysomething graduates perform the grunt work of the global information technology outsourcing industry, inputting data and managing the software and computer hardware of clients overseas.Less well known is that the city nicknamed India’s Silicon Valley is becoming a globally important centre of innovation. Alongside GE, multinationals such as Microsoft, Intel, Google, IBM and Britain’s Tesco supermarket chain, are opening R&D centres there. The Welch centre is GE’s biggest outside the US.This trend of moving up the value chain is just beginning and there is still much to do in terms of overcoming India’s chronic infrastructure problems and improving its education system. But for Vijay Govindarajan of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and chief innovation consultant at GE, the rise of these multinational R&D centres in India and China is driving a profound shift in innovation as significant as the move from mainframe computing to the personal computer, or the introduction of the internet.He notes that after the second world war, innovation originated chiefly in the US, resulting in products that were then distributed around the world. By the 1970s, Europe and Japan had rebuilt and become rival sources of innovation. Now, the trend is shifting to include India and China.“We are at the cusp of a new paradigm in which innovation will happen in India and China first and then it’ll go to the rich countries,” says Prof Govindarajan, who co-wrote a recent Harvard Business Review paper on the subject with Jeff Immelt, GE chief executive. “Companies, if they don’t realise it, will be toast.”The research potential of India’s engineering talent pool first drew attention in 1985, when Texas Instruments opened a technology centre in Bangalore. Today, more than 200 multinationals have R&D centres in the country. The ventures aim to tap the country’s phalanxes of engineers – India’s better tertiary institutions churn out about 600,000 a year – as well as the enormous pool of expatriate PhDs working in the west who are keen to return home. Cost is also a factor. Partha Iyengar of Gartner India, a branch of the consultancy, says that in terms of “dollar spent per ounce of innovation”, India’s cheaper engineers mean the equation is “dramatically different” than elsewhere.At first these R&D centres mostly supported their western counterparts. But in recent years increasing numbers have been entrusted with researching and developing entire products. In 2008, for instance, Intel launched the first commercial server chip wholly developed in its Bangalore design centre. The Xeon processor 7400 series marked a significant step forward for the US chipmaker, increasing the number of processing units built into each chip from four to six, enabling it to handle more intensive business enterprise applications.At Tesco’s Hindustan Service Centre in Bangalore, engineers played a central role in developing a system that uses thermal sensors and algorithms to calculate how many people are entering a store at a given time and when they are likely to leave, enabling managers to ensure enough tills are open to prevent long queues.Google’s Bangalore office has developed numerous products for the global market, such as the company’s Finance, Mapmaker and mobile text messaging programs.As staff carried out these international jobs, their managers began to take a greater interest in the domestic market. Prasad Ram of Google India says the Bangalore office began to wonder why so few Indians used the internet. Penetration is estimated at fewer than 100m fixed and mobile internet users in a population of 1.14bn people – one of the lowest rates in the world.They found that a lack of infrastructure was one important constraint. But another was a lack of suitable content in India’s 22 regional languages.In response, Google developed its Indic transliteration technology, in which users can type phonetic imitations of words in their language on an ordinary Roman alphabet keyboard that then appear in that language’s script. The product is now being extended to languages such as Arabic.The fact that it is harder to solve technical problems related to product development in India because of its diversity and lack of infrastructure “presents an opportunity”, says Mr Ram. “If I can solve challenges in a systemic way here, then I can extend the solution to the rest of the world.”At Microsoft Research India the same problem was tackled differently. The company hired an ethnographer, social scientist and designer to go to villages and study the use of computers. They found that even when rural schools were given a computer for the education of children, the exercise usually failed. Typically one child, usually a higher-caste male, would dominate the use of the machine.The result was “Multipoint”, in which a group of children are each given a mouse connecting them to the same computer. The multiple cursors mean they can all participate in whatever exercise is under way on the screen. The system is now being considered for commercial development.GE’s Welch centre still deploys most of its staff on global products. But, like Google and Microsoft, it has begun to focus on innovations suitable for the developing world. The best-known such product is a handheld electrocardiogram unit that costs about $1,000 to make – about one-tenth of the cost of a standard machine. This suits rural India, where poverty and weak transport links make it virtually impossible for many people to get to hospital.But these technologies are now also making their way back to developed markets. The electrocardiogram is being sold in the US. In the Harvard Business Review paper, Mr Immelt described this trend as “reverse innovation”.Making the shift is not easy. As Prof Govindarajan says, decision-making in large groups tends to be highly centralised. Unless managers in branch offices are given sufficient authority, innovation becomes impossible. “It is an organisational challenge; it is not a technological challenge,” he says.For multinationals, encouraging greater innovation from places such as India is not just a luxury. Indigenous conglomerates are evolving into experts in “frugal engineering”. An example is India’s Tata Group, which last year launched the Nano, the world’s cheapest car, with a starting price of Rs100,000 ($2,200, £1,400, €1,500). “If GE doesn’t come up with innovations in poor countries and take them global, new competitors from the developing world …will,” wrote Mr Immelt.Certainly, the day when Bangalore will challenge the supremacy of the US, Europe or Japan in path-breaking scientific research is still far off. India lacks the large-scale, high-quality master’s and PhD courses to produce many such breakthroughs. India and China have produced few Nobel prize-winners in science and technology, notes Prof Govindarajan.For India to overtake the US in R&D, the balance of its IT workforce would have to shift to 30 per cent research jobs, says Mr Iyengar of Gartner. “You can’t have the country becoming an IT superpower on the back of [the current level of] only 5 per cent.”Cities such as Bangalore, which is known for its congestion and, increasingly, pollution also need to address basic issues such as the environment and infrastructure. Otherwise, talented Indians living in western countries will not want to return home.“They’ve got used to not having to worry about kids cycling to school, or pollution. Those minimum levels of requirements do need to be addressed,” Mr Iyengar saysStill, the sheer weight of raw talent in India and China, Asia’s largest emerging economies, as well as the growing clout of their domestic markets, will be enough to drive the development of more products that will eventually make their way to the west.“What is shifting to the emerging markets, particularly India and China, is what I’d call application technology. You can create a new science but you need thousands and thousands of engineers to make commercially viable products. That is where India and China are surging ahead,” Prof Govindarajan says.Perhaps the clearest illustration of how things are changing is provided by Mr Wille at the Welch centre. Not far from Bangalore, he points out, is India’s first hydropower plant, installed by GE in 1902, in the jungles near the spectacular Cauvery Falls. The plant was commissioned by the princely state of Mysore using technology originally developed for North America by US engineers.Now, just over 100 years later, with products such as the mini-electrocardiogram, the flow of ideas is beginning to turn in the other direction."

They reached maturity as products this year, overcoming problems of poor battery life, resolution and luminescence, but they will always suffer from one key weakness.As I discovered, while trying out the Wowee Cinemin Swivel, the picture is only as good as the surface it is projected on.The essence of the projectors is that they are portable, but this takes you into many situations where there are uneven, non-white, angled surfaces and the picture suffers as a result.The Cinemin Swivel also delivered blurry images when I first tried it and I complained to Texas Instruments – makers of the DLP technology behind it.Much to my embarrassment, I finally realised I had failed to notice the packing tape was still over the lens and removing it produced an impressively clear and bright picture in a darkened room.The Swivel comes with an iPod/iPhone adapter and has a rather feeble built-in speaker, but I connected some iPod speakers to its headphone socket and projected an iPod touch video onto the ceiling while lying in bed – a picture equivalent to a 60-inch screen was possible.The Swivel is hinged as its name suggests, making its positioning more versatile, and the battery lasts more than two hours to take you through most movies.Products featuring integrated pico projectors include the Nikon Coolpix S1000pj camera and the recently announced LG eXpo smartphone, available through AT&T in the US.While DLP is the dominant technology, other methods of projection are beginning to appear. A number of models will be on show at the Consumer Electronics show next month, including the first product based on Texas-based Syndiant’s technology – the Lasino laser pico projector.
134;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-12-09T21:56:31Z;Greece and Dubai fears weigh on markets;Athens and Dubai stocks fall and Nikkei slides;21:35 GMT. Weak Japanese economic data combined with continued concerns about debt-laden Greece and Dubai to keep global bourses in cautious mood on Wednesday.Not even a small pull back in the dollar, following Tuesday’s rally, could fully salve investors’ anxiety – though it did help gold reverse some of its recent slide.The Athens stock market fell another 3.4 per cent and Greek government bonds tumbled as traders’ fears about the country’s fiscal position persisted following Fitch’s downgrade of Greece’s sovereign debt on Tuesday.The yield spread between German Bunds and Greek 10-year debt widened to more that 250 basis points at one stage, while an index that tracks the cost of insuring Greek debt from default – its five-year credit default swap – jumped from 209 basis points to 227 basis points, according to Reuters.News that Standard and Poor’s had put Spain on a negative credit outlook further dented sentiment.Meanwhile, the Dubai General equity index lost another 6.4 per cent and its five-year CDS rose from 542 basis points to 592 basis points, as investors remained wary of Dubai World’s $26bn debt restructuring. The Abu Dhabi stock market fell 2.8 per cent.Sensitivity to such worrying developments in the credit markets led to a choppy and mixed day for global stocks.In New York, the S&P 500 spent most of the day in the red but closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,095.95 after late dollar weakness lifted materials stocks. London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.4 per cent to 5,203.9 and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 1 per cent to 994.6.Life assurers were particularly weak in Europe after Fitch also warned of their exposure to weak eurozone sovereign debt issuers.The downbeat mood had been set by a poor showing in Asia, itself affected by a 1 per cent tumble in the US overnight. A poorly received forecast from Texas Instruments after the closing bell had also fed into nervous trading on Asian exchanges.One of the worst performers in the region was Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 fell 1.3 per cent to 10,004.7 after data showed the Japanese economy grew by much less than expected. Of particular concern was the damaging effect of a stronger yen on exporters, and the Japanese unit did little to ease those fears. The yen added to the strong gains of Tuesday, rising 0.7 per cent against the dollar to Y87.87 and gaining 0.5 per cent versus the euro to Y129.43.Mainland China’s benchmark, the Shanghai Composite, lost 1.7 per cent to 3,239.6 on worries about capital raising by banks and as the authorities appeared to be ratcheting up the rhetoric regarding asset bubbles. Reuters reported Zhang Ping, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, as saying that China would crack down on speculation in the property market.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng stumbled 1.4 per cent to 21,741.8, with financials taking a hit on debt-exposure concerns.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7 per cent to 4,637.9, reflecting continued weakness in the commodities complex.The RJ/CRB commodities index had lost 2.3 per cent on Tuesday as a stronger dollar dented demand for a swathe of resources. In Wednesday trade oil slumped further losing 2.6 per cent to $70.71 even as a blast of cold weather hit the Midwest and Northeast. The RJ/CRB fell another 1.5 per cent to 267.39.After early strength, the dollar eventually caved in and was off 0.4 per cent to 76.00 on a trade-weighted basis, and 0.2 per cent down at $1.47 versus the euro.The gold price fluctuated with the dollar but ended the day unchanged at $1,128.60.The triple-A government bond market was mixed following the rush of haven buying on Tuesday. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 3.42 per cent after a poor uptake at an auction of $21bn in 10-year notes.Japan’s 10-year JGB yield dipped 3 basis points to 1.24 per cent following the downbeat gross domestic product numbers.
135;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-12-03T21:27:13Z;ST Ericsson cuts 600 more jobs;;ST Ericsson, the maker of mobile phone chips, on Thursday said was planning to cut up to 600 more jobs – 7.5 per cent of its workforce – in an effort to make an additional $115m in annual savings.It will be the third round of restructuring and lay-offs that the loss-making company has announced in the past year. Created by combining the wireless chip operations of three companies – Ericsson, ST Microelectronics and NXP Wireless – the company announced 500 staff cuts in November to save $250m and a further 1200 redundancies in April with an aim to saving $230m a year.“These savings are expected to come from reductions in operating expenses and spending, along with an extensive R&D efficiency program,” ST Ericsson said.ST Ericsson, which supplied chips for mobile phones made by Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG Electronics, is under pressure to cut costs and reach profitability. In October, the company reported a $121m operating loss on net sales of $728m. The company said it would break even once sales were between $750m and $800m, but the strong euro was making it difficult to reach this goal.The company, which competes with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, reports its sales in dollars but most of its costs are in euros. The company had $216m in cash left at the end of the third quarter, having burned through nearly half of the original $400m it started with earlier this year.If it cannot reach breakeven, ST Ericsson would be forced to make a cash call on its parent companies, Ericsson and ST Micro. Such a move would be particularly unpalatable for Ericsson which is already facing calls to support its Sony Ericsson joint venture with Sony.
136;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-11-24T18:51:25Z;Brussels drops Qualcomm antitrust probe;;Europe’s top competition regulator has ended a four-year inquiry into patent royalty rates charged by Qualcomm after the remaining companies that had brought a complaint against the US mobile chipmaker withdrew.European Commission officials said on Tuesday that they had “committed time and resources to the investigation in order to assess a complex body of evidence,” but had not reached any formal conclusions.“All the complainants have now withdrawn or indicated their intention to withdraw their complaints and the commission has therefore to decide where best to focus its resources and priorities,” they said in a statement. “In view of this, the commission does not consider it appropriate to invest further resources in this case.”The EU probe, which began in 2005, followed a complaint by Nokia, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Ericsson, NEC and Panasonic Mobile Communications. This alleged that San Diego-based Qualcomm had refused to license patents to chipset competitors “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,” while “offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm”.The complainants had argued that Qualcomm’s technology played less of a role in 3G than in the previous mobile phone generation and therefore its royalty rates should be lower.But two of the complainants – Nokia and Broadcom – soon withdrew their objections after reaching settlements with the chipmaker.This year, the remaining complainants won favourable decisions from the Japanese and South Korean competition authorities, with Seoul imposing a record fine of just over $200m on Qualcomm.However, the issues and technologies involved were not identical to the EU case and Qualcomm is contesting both the Asian rulings.There has been a lot of speculation over whether the EU authorities were as willing to pursue the case as their Asian counterparts. Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, is believed to have called a rarely used panel to review the situation.Frustration at the lack of progress in Europe – and the hope of greater success in other jurisdictions – seems to have led the remaining companies to withdraw their EU complaint, although no official reason was given.Ericsson said only that “after success in Korea and Japan, Ericsson withdraws its complaint with the European Commission”.But Ericsson did signalthat it hoped action by other parts of the commission might prove more productive – such as an industry directorate white paper on modernising information communication technology standardisation in the EU.Qualcomm said it was “extremely pleased” with the outcome.
137;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-11-11T20:59:19Z;When the tough get going…;;"Here is a remarkable story of two of my classmates at Chicago Booth – David Lieb ’10 and Jake Mintz ’10 – who started a new technology company while pursuing their MBA at Chicago Booth. Their company, “Bump” started off as a wildly successful Apple iphone application that allows users to exchange contact information easily, but is now fast morphing into a universal mode for information exchange across platforms and perhaps might even become a payment gateway for mobile devices, among other things.Bump won the New Venture Challenge at Chicago Booth and has just received $3m in funding led by Sequoia Capital. I recently interviewed Dave and Jake (who are currently “on leave” from Chicago Booth and working tirelessly out of their offices in Silicon Valley) about the remarkable story behind Bump. Especially in these tough economic times, this is a story of great inspiration and innovation!Dave: I grew up in Dallas, Texas and majored in electrical engineering at Princeton. After graduating, I didn’t want to get a job just yet, so I went to Stanford for a masters in electrical engineering. After graduating, I worked for three years at Texas Instruments in the DLP group, developing image processing algorithms for projectors and big-screen TVs.Jake: I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska in a family of entrepreneurs. My grandfather is still my most important mentor and biggest inspiration. I studied electrical engineering in college but pursued technical sales and marketing (also at Texas Instruments) because I thought I could do more bridging the technical and business worlds than focusing on engineering.Dave: I left Texas Instruments to get an MBA because I wanted to learn how to start and run a company. I felt that as an engineer, I didn’t have full control over turning my inventions into actual products, so I wanted to learn what was needed to do that. I chose Chicago because it is a place where I felt I could really be myself and pursue the things I wanted to, rather than having to fit into some “MBA mold”.Jake: I wanted to start a business but didn’t have a problem I was passionate about solving and didn’t know anyone else who wanted to start a business. I decided that getting an MBA would give me the opportunity to meet smart people with similar interests and let me work through several business ideas I had. I chose Chicago because the flexible curriculum let me focus on the classes that were important to me and the rigorous academic environment meant I would get a lot out of my classes.Dave: In the first few weeks of business school, I met dozens of new classmates and inevitably entered their names and phone numbers into my phone. Frankly, I just got sick of doing that, so I tried to think of a good way to make that process more manageable. During an accounting class one day, I noticed that all my classmates had new smartphones that contained all sorts of new sensors and the idea really just hit me.That night, I emailed a former colleague of mine at Texas Instruments and we got started right away. Jake joined us soon after. I’d say that our expectations for Bump definitely evolved over the subsequent months – at first, we just thought it could be an interesting app to solve the contact information exchange problem, but we soon realised that the core technology was extremely valuable in lots of situations.Dave & Jake: Just being at school gave us the luxury to work on Bump. Being around a lot of smart people (students and faculty) gave us a lot of powerful early feedback on our technology, applications and business ideas. In general though, it is difficult for a school to support entrepreneurship since everyone’s needs are so different. Having a small community of entrepreneurs that supported each other was probably the most helpful resource.Dave & Jake: In the very early days we were most concerned with early traction. Our success (and luck) getting early traction accelerated everything else we have tried to do. Currently we are focused on sustainable growth and building an amazing team, two very difficult challenges.Dave & Jake: The New Venture Challenge helped us in different ways than we expected. The class helped us improve our presentation and story telling abilities, which proved immensely important when we pitched the business to venture capital firms. Also, several of the NVC judges have turned into incredible advisors on issues ranging from fund raising to strategy and hiring. We ended up scrapping the presentation and business plan we created for class and created a new presentation when we began fund raising a few months later.Dave & Jake: Our vision is to change the way people interact with each other, using the mobile phone as an enabling tool. At this point we are focused on creating more value for our users and growing our team.Jake: I love going to school and would love to complete my degree some day, but if I return it will be a lifestyle choice, more than a career choice.Dave: Absolutely. I don’t think I would have pursued Bump seriously had I been working full-time. Being a student really allowed me to take the risk to spend time on Bump, since my opportunity cost was so low. School is a great place to figure out what you want to do with your life.Dave & Jake: An MBA is not necessary and can become a crutch if it results in a state of paralysis due to over-planning and over-analysis. It’s important to dive in quickly and start building and selling; that’s when you really learn about your business, not when you are researching.An MBA provides a lot of important tools that have helped us along the way; but the classes that helped the most aren’t the ones we expected (entrepreneurship classes) but rather ones like negotiations, marketing, etc."
138;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Qualcomm sees falling phone prices in 2010;;The growth of the smartphone category is causing intense competition among operating systems, handset makers and the chipmakers that supply them.Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, the biggest wireless chipmaker, sees that competition intensifying over the next year in smartphones and other handsets, which will translate into lower prices.“If I look at the chip business, I definitely see some of our competitors who are sort of down and are getting a little bit more desperate, and I think we’re going to see a pretty competitive market over the next year,” he told me, before Qualcomm’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.Qualcomm’s competitors include Texas Instruments, Samsung, Broadcom, Freescale and, shortly, Intel with its Atom processor.Average selling prices (ASPs) for handsets using Qualcomm’s CDMA technology were $200 in its fiscal year ending in September. It expects ASPs to fall around 6 per cent in the current year to $189 as 3G operators expand in emerging markets and offer cheaper devices.ASPs for the chipsets inside the handsets will also fall. They usually decline around 3 per cent each year, but Qualcomm expects the figure to be “substantially higher” in 2010.It has been preparing for a possible price war by cutting its costs and investing in research that leads to integrated chipsets, where more technologies can be crammed on a single chip.This appeals to customers, who pay more for the chips but need fewer of them, and Qualcomm, which can maintain its gross margins by being the single chip solution of choice.If the chipmaker sees 2009 as the year of the smartphone, it views 2010 as the year when smartbooks – a category somewhere between smartphones and netbooks – will take off.Qualcomm stands to benefit from wider adoption of its Snapdragon 1GHz microprocessor, which is already appearing in high-end smartphones like Sony Ericsson’s X10.“We expect that the first smartbooks will be announced before the end of this year,” Steve Mollenkopf, head of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, told the earnings call.“2010 [is] expected to be the year that Snapdragon-powered smartbooks ramp [to] volume production.”

Its designs are licensed to semiconductor companies for incorporation into products such as smartphones, music players and washing machines.Mr East said Arm would “at least” meet rising market expectations for full-year dollar revenue projections. Analysts are expecting the group to achieve revenue of $476m for the year, ahead of earlier predictions of about $450m but below Arm’s record of $546.2m in 2008.The semiconductor sector is starting to recover from a severe destocking at the start of the year, when cash-strapped consumers stopped spending on gadgets. Chipmakers such as Intel, Texas Instruments and Broadcom have all exceeded expectations on sales.Arm is benefiting from growing shipments of smartphones – its designs are used in the Apple iPhone – and increasing market share in microcontrollers, which regulate battery power.A growing number of devices now use microcontroller chips and Arm has seen a 75 per cent sequential increase in shipments in this segment, albeit at a price. The larger number of lower-value microcontrollers in the mix has pushed average royalty rates down from 5.7 cents in the second quarter to 5.3 cents in the third quarter.Worldwide smartphone sales are expected to grow 29 per cent to reach 180m units this year, according to Gartner. The smartphone trend has boosted the number of Arm chips in each mobile phone, with a global average of 2.1 per handset, against two per phone in the second quarter.Revenue for the three months to September 30 fell 8 per cent to $123m but, in sterling terms, rose 5 per cent to £75.2m. Pre-tax profit fell 2 per cent to $24.3m.Arm was helped by sterling weakness against the dollar, as its US payroll accounts for about half of its costs. On a nine-month basis, revenue rose 7 per cent to £219.8m and pre-tax profits fell 5 per cent to £64.5m. In dollar terms, revenue fell 12 per cent to $349.4m. Arm shares, which have gained 87 per cent over the past year, rose 0.8p to close at 150p.

141;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-10-22T18:52:40Z;Auction rate securities facing tough scrutiny;;For investors stuck with securities they once thought were cash-like holdings, a new danger has emerged.E-mail scammers are promising at least $1.5m in compensation for holders of auction rate securities, the $330bn market that seized up in February of 2008 and remains frozen over. Though the e-mails look as if they come from Finra, an industry regulator, they do not. Finra has issued an alert, warning people not to respond to the “phishing” scam.Holders of auction rate securities – which include companies round the world that placed spare cash in the market – are handy targets, not least because ARS are one of the few sectors hit during the financial crisis that have received numerous settlements, although not all investors have been included.“The auction rate securities settlements as they were structured created a wedge between the beneficiaries, such as retail investors and other investors,” said Jeff Nielsen, managing director at Navigant Consulting, which advises on litigation. Indeed, this split is one of the reasons so many investors continue to hope that they, too, will be able to recover a large part of their original investments, and litigation in the ARS market continues apace (see chart).The boom in structured finance in the past decade, which created hundreds of billions of dollars of securities backed by mortgages and other loans, many of which have now soured, has resulted in a litigation frenzy. ARS represent a large part of the legal battles.Regulators are, indeed, still monitoring the ARS market following complaints from institutional investors who say they are still stuck.Leading Wall Street banks reached landmark settlements last year with regulators, including Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and a task force of state securities regulators, committing to buy back more than $60bn of the debt securities and paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.Some banks, such as UBS, had agreed to buy back all the ARS it sold to both retail and institutional investors, but most other banks pledged to make “best efforts” to help institutional investors to sell the securities – wording that falls short of a commitment to buy them back.“The SEC continues to monitor the firms’ progress,” said a SEC spokesman, who declined to discuss the efforts being made by banks. Mr Cuomo’s office declined to comment.The increased scrutiny from lawmakers comes as US companies step up efforts to get the US government to take up the cause of the auction rate securities market which has been frozen solid for more than 18 months. Companies holding $8bn of ARS backed by student loans – including companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Texas Instruments – are calling for a government plan to kickstart the market after private sector restructuring efforts continue to fail.Once a source of $330bn of finance for municipalities, student loan providers and US mutual funds, the auction rate securities market collapsed as banks made losses on mortgage-backed securities and other investments and were faced with balance sheet constraints. Investors thought the banks would always provide liquidity – the banks in many cases found they legally did not need to and thus pulled out.The ARS experience highlights two risks that investors failed to factor in correctly. First of all, it was assumed that liquidity would be available, and it was not.“Thanks to the credit crunch, investors no longer manage risk, they manage uncertainty,” said Amin Rajan, chief executive of CREATE-Research. “One relies on known probabilities of expected returns, the other on pure guesswork. As a result, liquidity has become an asset class in its own right.”Secondly, it highlights just how crucial the details of contracts in the structured finance business are.“Whether you are talking about CDOs [collateralised debt obligations] or ARS, provisions in contracts are being stress tested in a way that was frankly never conceived,” said Mr Nielsen.
142;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-10-21T04:31:48Z;Auction-rate bond holders seek government help;;The failure of private-sector efforts to thaw some $85bn in illiquid auction-rate securities backed by student loans is pushing a group of US corporate treasurers to press for help from the US government.Since the $330bn auction-rate securities (ARS) market collapsed more than 18 months ago, there has been a debate as to who should shoulder the resulting losses.In the case of ARS backed by government-guaranteed student loans, dozens of US companies who bought them as a cash-like alternative are now holding bonds with maturities of up to 20 years. They could sell them, but at 70 or 80 cents on the dollar.“We’re not so financially squeezed that we need to take such a loss,” said John Woodfill, vice president of finance at Ash Grove Cement, which owns $60m student loan ARS and is one of 25 companies pressing for government action. Other members of the group include Abercrombie & Fitch and Texas Instruments.The group is seeking some kind of government liquidity facility which would encourage buying of ARS, a move the companies say could lower funding costs and encourage student loan trusts to restructure the debts. By allowing companies to sell their ARS - and companies hold an estimated $25bn of the student loan sector - they say the government would be making available billions of dollars for investment.The group says a government backstop could work, similar to methods used to kickstart securities backed by credit cards and auto loans and commercial paper sectors. The group does not believe it will cost the government any money.Erik Klingenberg, partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, which is advising the group, said initial discussions had been held with Treasury officials. “It is very difficult for problems in asset classes to be resolved without a government solution,” said Mr Klingenberg.For decades, the ARS market was used by municipalities and student loan providers to raise funds. It offered a handy way to match up investors seeking short-term investments with a little extra yield – from retail buyers to corporate treasurers sitting on cashpiles – with issuers seeking long-term financing.That was done by resetting interest rates at weekly or monthly intervals. Short-term investors assumed they could sell any bonds at every reset. This assumption has proved to be costly: when dealers in this market faced balance sheet pressures they stopped buying bonds, leaving investors holding illiquid bonds.Retail investors were helped out after regulators pushed banks to buy them out at par. Some debt was refinanced by issuers seeking to avoid high penalty interest rates. In the case of student loan ARS, mostly owned by institutional and corporate investors, there has been little pressure on banks to “make whole”. Meanwhile, the structures continue to offer issuers cheap finance, even if investors are sitting on losses.“There is little financial incentive for issuers to restructure and most attempts have failed,” said one banker. ”Many investors also do not want to budge and take a write-down on government-guaranteed debt. That is the problem.”
143;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-10-19T23:31:20Z;Apple leaps ahead with 47% profits surge;;Apple profits jumped 47 per cent on surging iPhone and Macintosh computer sales in the latest quarter, capping a remarkable boom year for a company whose rivals were lucky to tread water.Although Google and other tech companies have recently reported strong results or an improved outlook, raising optimism in the sector, none have outstripped expectations as markedly as Apple.The company defied the consumer recession as unit sales of iPhones rose 7 per cent and Macintosh computer shipments jumped 17 per cent in the quarter ending in late September.Overall profit increased to a record $1.67bn, or $1.82 a share, from $1.14bn or $1.26 a share, shattering the Wall Street consensus forecast of $1.42. Apple shares rose 5.5 per cent to $200.35 in early Wall Street trading on Tuesday, having hit a a record $207 in after-hours trading on Monday.Analysts said they saw no reason for a slowdown in Apple’s momentum, which drove annual profit up 18 per cent to $5.7bn. The company is launching the iPhone in China and is allying with additional wireless carriers in the UK and elsewhere. Apple is also pushing to extend the “halo” effect from the sales of iPhones to other devices.It is expected to announce new versions of its desktop and portable computers in the next few weeks, trying to extend its market share gains by reaching consumers uncertain about upgrading to Microsoft’s new Windows 7 operating system.“We’ve got a very strong line-up for the holiday season and some really great new products in the pipeline for 2010,” said Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive.Executives would not give specifics but observers said both the all-in-one desktop iMacs that combine displays and drives and the MacBook notebooks might receive their first serious refurbishment in about two years. “There are a lot of indications that a refresh is coming,” said Yair Reiner, Oppenheimer analyst.The lower-end MacBook’s plastic casing seemed dated, analysts said, and the new desktop computers were likely to be thinner and faster. Trade publications have reported that volume manufacturing has begun and that Apple is offering discounts to cut the number of existing models in the sales channel.Apple has increased its minority share of the personal computing market by combining solid products with effective advertising that often takes aim at the complexity and instability of machines running Microsoft’s Windows.Because those commercials have worked well, some analysts suspect Apple may be waiting to see the advertising that comes with Windows 7’s broad availability this Thursday. It could then launch counter-ads, perhaps focusing on the challenges of upgrading from Windows XP, which requires reinstallation of all programs.●Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker, said customers had raised production levels in the past two quarters in a rebound from recession. Third-quarter profits of 42 cents a share on revenues of $2.88bn beat Wall Street expectations of 40 cents, on sales of $2.82bn.

The last time it traded above 1,100 was in October 2008.“There have been a few misses in terms of revenues, but what the market is focusing on is the fact that most companies have beaten market expectations,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York.Traders are looking for positive news on corporate earnings as a sign that the nascent economic recovery is taking hold. Stocks had priced in fairly rosy expectations, analysts said.The big news of the day was to come in after-hours trade when technology bellwethers Apple and Texas Instruments released their results. Apple shares were 1 per cent higher at $189.86 and Texas Instruments was up 3.4 per cent higher at $23.52 ahead of their earnings reports.Shares of Caterpillar surged 6 per cent to $57.85 ahead of the release of the earnings today for the maker of construction, farming and mining equipment.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday raised its 12-month target on Caterpillar from $52 to $65.RBC Capital Markets on Friday initiated coverage of Caterpillar with a rating of “outperform” and a price target of $65.“We view [Caterpillar] as among the best-positioned companies to benefit from improving global growth and the attendant spending on construction, infrastructure, commodities, and the like,” RBC said.Caterpillar’s rise helped to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent higher to 10,092.19, holding above the psychological level of 10,000 it breached last week for the first time in a year.After an early decline, the Nasdaq recovered and ended up 0.9 per cent at 2,176.32.This week is one of the peak weeks for the third quarter 2009 earnings season, with 13 Dow components and more than 130 S&P 500 companies expected to announce results.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter will fall 22.6 per cent, down from a previous estimate of 24.6 per cent last week at the beginning of earnings season. This is due in part to better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the financial sector.Nonetheless, companies that released earnings on Monday showed some mixed results, initially prompting fluctuation in the large indices.Gannett, publisher of USA Today, reported a 53 per cent decline in third quarter net profit, but exceeded its own expectations on improved advertising spending trends and steep cost cuts. Its shares rose 8.2 per cent at $14.06.Advertising revenues at its publishing division fell 28.4 per cent to $699.6m from last year, which was less severe than the year-on-year declines in the first and second quarters of this year when advertising fell more than 30 per cent.Eaton gained 5.7 per cent to $63.89 after the diversified manufacturing company reported better-than- expected quarterly earnings and boosted its full-year estimate.Hasbro was down 3.7 per cent at $28.42 after the toy maker said its quarterly profit rose 8.8 per cent, which was ahead of the expectations on Wall Street, however, its revenues declined.After the results, Standards and Poor’s upgraded Hasbro to “buy” from “hold”, saying that although revenues of $1.28bn were below their $1.37bn estimate, higher than expected cost reductions meant earnings per share of 99 cents, against 89 cents a year earlier, were in line with their estimate. S&P noted that revenues grew 1 per cent excluding foreign exchange and that improved margins would likely aid results into 2010.BB&T‘s quarterly profit fell more than 50 per cent as the financial company continued to sort through credit issues from the financial crisis. Its shares were down 4.3 per cent at $27.03.
145;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Ford recalls 4.5m more vehicles;;Ford Motor has expanded the US car industry’s ­biggest-ever recall by about 4.5m vehicles over a faulty cruise-control switch linked to hundreds of fires.Tuesday’s move brings the total number of vehicles recalled with the same problem to 14.3m, in eight separate notifications since 1999.The switch, which is used to deactivate the cruise control function when the driver taps the foot brake, is made by Dallas-based Texas Instruments. A Ford spokesman was unable to say on Tuesday whether the carmaker had brought legal action against the supplier.He said that Ford did not disclose how the costs of the recall would be apportioned between the two companies.TI shares were down 1.1 per cent at the close of trade in New York, while Ford closed unchanged on the day.Ford said that the latest recall was originally designed to cover 1.1m Windstar minivans, but that it was widened to several other models in the hope of putting the problem to rest once and for all.“We didn’t want our customers to have any concerns about it,” the company said. Most of the vehicles are more than 10 years old.The switches have been found to leak, causing fires that sometimes ignite long after the driver has left the vehicle.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has linked the defective switches to about 550 fires and 1,500 complaints. But Ford said it was un­aware of any deaths or injuries caused by smoke or fire from the parts.Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the carmaker over the switches. A jury in South Carolina awarded a couple $3.5m last year, including $3m in punitive damages, after a fire in a Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle allegedly spread to a house. Ford has appealed against the ruling.The US government issued a total of 37 vehicle recall notices in September, which included trucks, motorcycles and re­creational vehicles.Toyota advised owners of 3.8m vehicles in North America last week to remove floor mats on the driver’s side after evidence that unsecured mats caused the accelerator to jam.The second-biggest vehicle recall in the US took place in 1996 when Ford repaired 9.6m vehicles after customers complained about fires caused by faulty ignition systems. Its most damaging recall involved Firestone tyres on its Explorer SUVs, which were linked to numerous fatal accidents.
146;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:30:00+0000;Water splashes onto pensions agenda;;Water management is increasingly viewed as a big cost issue for companies rather than just an environmental factor.The recent move by the Norwegian Government Pension Fund to add water management to its corporate governance investment criteria will only strengthen the trend.The fund, one of world’s biggest, will start next month sending out its newly published investors’ expectations document on water management to the 1,100 companies in its NKr2,385bn (£246bn, €277bn, $407bn) portfolio that pose a water-related investment risk.The fear is that water scarcity, regulations, and higher purification costs could affect company profits. Economic growth, rising population and industrial expansion are driving the demand for water, while climate change, pollution and regulation are affecting supply.A report by the Pacific Institute on behalf of Ceres earlier this year found that 11 of the world’s 14 largest semiconductor factories were located in the Asia-Pacific region, where water quality risks are severe. Firms such as Intel and Texas Instruments need ultra-clean water to make silicon chips. A water-related shutdown at these factories could result in $100m-$200m in missed revenue during a quarter, or $0.02-$0.04 per share.“Generally there has been a pick-up in attention as to what water management really means to a company,” says Peder Michael Pruzan-Jorgensen, European director for BSR, a global business network and consultancy focused on sustainability. “Gap has made jeans with water use guidelines. The tricky thing with water is that there is no replacement for it. For oil there is.” Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, has identified seven high-risk sectors: the food industry, agriculture, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, mining, manufacturing and power production, and the water supply industry.The fund’s new focus on water will not only influence the way it votes the shares it already holds in these areas, but also its long-term evaluation of companies, according to Anne Kvam, NBIM head of corporate governance. She hopes it will influence other funds – which have followed Norway’s lead in the past – and that the corporate sector will take the water issue seriously.“Some of the larger international funds out there will be copying [the fund’s] criteria and methods,” says Christine Tørklep Meisingset, head of responsible investment research at Storebrand Investments. “They will look at NBIM because of its size. For us, it makes it easier to address water when engaging with companies.”Storebrand, a Norwegian insurer managing NKr336bn in assets, took up water risk as early as 1995 when it first established a niche environmental value fund and has been excluding high-risk companies that do not take into account water management since 2001. It is currently the only Norwegian company in the World Business Council.Calpers, the largest US pension fund, says it has not specifically used water management as a condition for investing in public stock companies, but supports the recommendations in the Ceres report, such as better corporate disclosure on water-related risks. It is also aggressively pursuing water management in the private equity arena, such as a recent $260m commitment to Vinod Khosla’s clean tech funds.Dutch pension fund APG, one of the world’s largest pension funds, considers water risk in its integrated investment analysis, in particular for high risk sectors such as the consumer sector. The fund actively engages with its investee companies and participates in stakeholder initiatives, such as the UN CEO Water Mandate, which focuses on developing corporate strategies and solutions to global water issues.“Water is one of our key sustainability themes as we believe that companies in our portfolio could potentially be exposed to substantial risk related to water shortages or community protests against companies’ use of scarce water resources that are also needed for local use,” says Rob Lake, head of sustainability at APG Asset Management.NBIM plans to publish a compliance report for water management in the first quarter of 2010.
147;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-09-18T21:04:04Z;Consumer and building stocks lead way on Wall Street;;Consumer groups and homebuilders pushed US stocks higher in choppy trade on Friday as investors shrugged off concerns over a pull-back.In the consumer staples sector, Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, pushed the Dow to its highest level for the year. The shares rose 3.2 per cent to $57.32 after Citigroup raised the stock to “buy” from “hold”. Citi also lifted its price estimate to $66 from $54 and said P&G was preparing to win back market share.Homebuilders continued to climb. Data this week showed that US residential building had reached a nine-month high in August and confidence among US homebuilders had risen in September for a third consecutive month.KB Home, the Los Angeles housebuilder, rose 2.6 per cent to $20.21 on Fridayafter JPMorgan raised the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”.Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, was also on JPMorgan’s upgrade list and gained 3.1 per cent to $22.20. The optimism spread to the rest of the sector, pushing Beazer Homes up 7.6 per cent to $5.52.Friday’s session marked the quarterly expiration and settlement of four different types of September equity futures and options contracts, during which volatility is typically higher as traders unwind their positions. Due to this event – known as “quadruple witching” – trading was choppy before stocks climbed higher towards the closing bell.After brief periods in the red, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,068.30, less than 1 point beneath its year high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 9,820.20, hitting its highest level since last October, and the Nasdaq rose 0.3 per cent to 2,132.86.Over the past week the S&P gained 2.5 per cent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.5 per cent. The Dow was up 2.2 per cent – its biggest weekly gain since late July.“Equities continue to grind higher on very light volume and if anything there’s a little bit of focus on the Fed’s statement next week,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.Encouraging economic indicators this week boosted hopes of an economic recovery, lifting stocks to 11-month highs.The energy, materials and industrial sectors led most of Wall Street’s gains in the past few sessions as gold continued to hover above $1,000 per troy ounce and the price of oil surged back above $70 a barrel.Some energy stocks lost momentum on Friday as the oil price fell in early trading. But Chevron gained 0.9 per cent to $72.64 after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.After closing 20 per cent higher on Thursday, AMR came back into focus after reports that American Airlines, its principal subsidiary, would team up with British Airways and Qantas Airways to offer Japan Airlines fresh capital.The deal would help fight off a rival offer from Delta Air Lines. AMR shares lost 1.7 per cent to $8.65.The reports follow the group’s announcement on Thursday that it had raised $2.9bn in cash and loans to increase its number of flights from Chicago, New York, Dallas and Miami.In the technology sector, Palm, the smartphone manufacturer, reported a smaller than expected fiscal first-quarter loss late on Thursday. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $14.01 yesterday, because Palm also gave a weak second-quarter sales forecast and said it planned to sell 16m shares of common stock.SanDisk, the biggest maker of flash-memory cards, rose 5.5 per cent to $22.84 after Bank of America upgraded the stock to “buy” from “underperform”. Texas Instruments rose 2 per cent to $24.06 after the chipmaker said it planned to raise its quarterly dividend by 1 cent to 12 cents a share.
148;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-09-10T20:44:04Z;Wall Street rallies on jobs data;;Wall Street stocks hit fresh highs for the year following a shaky start on Thursday, after encouraging data on jobs and a successful Treasury bond auction reassured investors.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed 550,000 Americans had filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was down from 570,000 in the previous week and better than economists’ forecasts of 560,000.A strong Treasury auction also relieved concerns about the US deficit.Uncertainty lingered over President Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system, but health insurance stocks reacted well.After recent losses, WellPoint rose 2.5 per cent to $54.18, while Unitedhealth Group also gained 2.5 per cent to $29.11.The US president said that under his plan, it would be illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or cancel coverage due to sickness, and that they would also be required to cover routine check-ups and preventive care.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up at its high for the day of 1,044.14, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,627.48.After five straight days of gains, the market hit fresh highs since last October. The S&P also hit its high for the year on Wednesday.The technology-focused Nasdaq, which has outperformed the other indices every day this week, climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,084.02.Shuffle Master added to the gains in the tech sector after the company posted second-quarter earnings above expectations. Shares in the company, which makes automatic card shufflers for casinos, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.40.Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, said it was expecting stronger revenue than it had forecast in July for the third quarter. The shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $25 after early gains.Yahoo rose 4.5 per cent to $15.45 after Bank of America changed its recommendation to “buy” from “neutral”, saying growth in the company’s user traffic continued to outpace growth in the internet as a whole. Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Time Warner, boosting its shares by 3.7 per cent to $29.51.“The run that we’ve seen in stocks still continues to impress,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage. “The stocks are overbought here but I’ve been saying that for a long time . . . the biggest issue in the end will be about revenue. You can say, well, we beat earnings expectations but are you making money? That’s going to be the big question.”Airlines also lifted the market after an analyst from JPMorgan said demand was “not as bad as feared” and bankruptcies in the sector were unlikely. United Airlines parent UAL led the sector, rising 17.8 per cent to $7.6, while US Airways also climbed 12.3 per cent to $4.02. The market’s early gains, however, were led by the consumer staples index.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, rose 4.2 per cent to $56.04 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 above analyst expectations.General Mills, which owns brand such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, said easing commodity inflation meant its fiscal first-quarter earnings were also running ahead of its target. Its shares fell back 0.6 per cent to $60.90 after early gains.But the materials sector continued to weigh on market sentiment, after pushing the indices into negative territory in early trading. Shares in Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, slid 5 per cent to $79.30 after the company forecast earnings below estimates. It said trading in its herbicide business had suffered due to oversupply in the market.The utilities index also pushed the market lower, after spending most of the past three weeks in negative territory.Ameren fell 2.8 per cent to $25.35 after the power company said it planned to offer 19m common shares to raise cash for investment in its subsidiaries.
149;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-23T16:23:27Z;Qualcomm in record S Korea antitrust fine;;South Korea’s antitrust watchdog on Thursday fined Qualcomm a record Won260bn ($207m) for “unfair” business practices related to its chipset sales, sparking strong protests from the US wireless chip and technology supplier.The Fair Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the Korean market for CDMA mobile phone chips.Qualcomm had levied higher royalties on handset makers that bought modem chips from its competitors, while offering rebates to customers who bought products mainly from the US group, the regulator said in a statement.“Qualcomm owns the origin of CDMA technology and controls about 99.4 per cent of Korea’s CDMA modem chip market. It has strengthened its monopolistic position through those acts,” the FTC said.The fine is the largest the commission has imposed on a single company. The FTC fined Microsoft Won32.5bn in 2006 for anticompetitive business practices in Korea.The ruling came after more than three years of investigations into Qualcomm, following complaints from two US companies – Texas Instruments and Broadcom – and two small Korean firms – Nextreaming and Thin Multimedia Broadcom. Broadcom reached a settlement with Qualcomm in April and withdrew its complaint.The FTC said some companies such as Via of Taiwan and EoNex of Korea had tried to enter the modem chip market in 2004 and 2005 by supplying to Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, but they had failed to gain “meaningful” market share because of Qualcomm’s practices.The regulator ordered Qualcomm to stop such unfair practices and to stop taking technology royalties after the effective royalty agreement period expires.Qualcomm said the FTC decision was “regrettable” and that its business practices were “legal, appropriate and competition-friendly”. It said it would appeal.Its Korean office said Qualcomm could not accept the FTC’s decision because offering different incentives depending on the purchased volume was a “natural marketing” tactic. This week, Qualcomm warned the fine could have a “material impact” on its operations.
150;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-22T23:05:43Z;Qualcomm sales surge hints at sector recovery;;Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, reported a surge in demand in its June quarter amid growth in the 3G market.The San Diego company raised its guidance for its fiscal year in another sign that the chip industry was recovering from a slump in demand.Intel, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and now Qualcomm have all reported in the past 10 days that customers have begun replenishing their stocks after running them down in the recession.“Things have pretty much come back on the chipset side,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.“The lowest part of the trough was 63m [chipset sales] a couple of quarters ago. Now we shipped 94m this quarter, so it’s a pretty substantial recovery.”However, Qualcomm predicted lower shipments for its fourth quarter of 88m to 92m chipsets. The company said there had been a couple of significant operator launches in the June quarter and it still expected growth in the second half of the calendar year.It predicted full fiscal year revenues of $10.25bn to $10.45bn, up $200m to $400m on its previous estimate, and operating income of $3.3bn to $3.4bn, an increase of $250m to $350m on its earlier prediction.“Smartphone demand is still strong and the other trend we see is that 3G continues to be strong – we are looking at 3G passing 2G next year in terms of shipments,” said Mr Jacobs.Qualcomm also signalled it was nearing the end of extensive legal battles over its business practices, patent issues and the royalties it charges for use of its CDMA technology for mobile phones.It said it had been advised that the Fair Trade Commission in South Korea would issue a decision shortly over its alleged anticompetitive practices there.“We are also anticipating that the KFTC will impose a fine . . . we expect it will be substantial and could have a material impact on our results,” it said.Qualcomm has already settled with Nokia, the handset maker, and Broadcom, a rival wireless chipmaker, with both withdrawing complaints made to the authorities in the US, Europe and the KFTC.The company reported revenues of $2.74bn, compared to $2.76bn a year earlier. Profits of $903m, down from $915m a year ago, were an improvement on a $46m loss in the previous quarter. Its shares fell 5 per cent in extended trading, after rising about 9 per cent over the past week.
151;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-22T21:34:14Z;Squaring up for a battle in miniature;;On the morning that Google announced plans to create its Chrome operating system to rival Microsoft’s Windows, Ian Drew, head of marketing at Arm Holdings, the UK semiconductor design company, woke up with a big grin on his face.The cause of his delight was a sentence in the Google press release saying the new Chrome OS would be designed to run not just on standard computer chips, but also on Arm-designed semiconductors, which are most commonly used in phones.Arm had just won a powerful ally in what is shaping to be an epic battle with Intel over the future of microprocessors.Cambridge-based Arm dominates the market for mobile chips, with about 95 per cent of handsets containing microprocessors designed by the company. It excels in creating small and power-efficient chips that are ideal for mobile devices, and its designs form the basis of the chips made by companies such as Qualcomm, ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments,Intel, on the other hand, has dominated the market for computer chips, which are faster and more powerful, but consume far more power than mobile phone microprocessors.For many years the two chip markets remained separate and Intel made only a brief but unsuccessful foray into the mobile market.Recently, however, devices such as Apple’s iPhone and netbooks – cheap mini-laptops – have started blurring the lines between the mobile and computer industries. Intel and Arm have been set for a collision course.A number of netbooks using Arm chips were unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan in July, and Warren East, chief executive of Arm, has made bullish statements about wanting to put Arm chips in everything from television set-top boxes to servers.Intel, meanwhile, has developed a much smaller, more power-efficient chip, known as the Atom, which is used in a number of netbooks. It has said that by 2011 the company can create a chip efficient enough to be used in a mobile phone.There is still quite a difference between the two types of chips. Arm chips are about a quarter of the size and power consumption of Intel’s Atom chips, but the Atom is nearly twice as fast. Over time, these differences will shrink.“That basis of that differentiation will disappear in a year and a half to two year’s time,” agreed John Jackson, analyst at CCS Insight. At that point, what will matter are the alliances the two companies have built.Intel, for example, claims an advantage because most internet sites have been written for its chip architecture. People are increasingly surfing the web over their handsets, but some applications and websites may not run as well on an Arm-based phone.Some software companies such as Adobe have begun to switch their software to run on Arm as well as the Intel chip, but Microsoft, most notably, has not. Its full Windows operating system will not run on an Arm device, a major stumbling block. Consumers have shown a strong preference for netbooks running the familiar Windows system.Google’s plans for an operating system makes this less of a problem, as it could create a real alternative to Windows. It may also cause Microsoft to rethink its strategy.Intel, meanwhile, is also developing alliances of its own. Last month it announced a strategic partnership with Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer, to undertake joint research into products that would be a hybrid of a smartphone and a laptop.The Arm camp, however, believe they have an advantage in their more competitive business model. Unlike Intel, which designs and manufactures chips, Arm designs the chips but licenses the technology to a range of manufacturers.The market for the new hybrid devices is still in its infancy. But as more of these products come onto the market, the battle will commence.This is part of a series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.

153;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Bullish TI beats profit forecasts;;Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, reported a surge in demand for its products in the second quarter as it beat revenue and profit expectations.Following Intel’s positive outlook last week, TI gave another boost to the tech sector, forecasting solid growth in the current quarter.In the same way as Intel, TI had suffered with customers slashing their orders and living off their existing inventories from the end of last year through the first quarter, in order to cope with the recession and an uncertain outlook.“After sharp inventory corrections in our markets during the prior two quarters, our revenue levels are beginning to more closely reflect end demand,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive, in a statement on Monday.TI is also beginning to benefit from its earlier cost-cutting measures.“As it will likely take some time before the economy strengthens, we have aligned our operations and expenses to be consistent with the weak environment. As a result, we are seeing healthy trends in our profitability,” Mr Templeton said.The Dallas-based company reported second-quarter sales of $2.46bn and profits of $260m or 20 cents per share. Analysts expected profits of 19 cents on revenues of $2.42bn, according to a consensus gathered by Bloomberg.Revenues were 18 per cent higher than the first quarter but were down 27 per cent on the same quarter a year ago. TI’s factories are still under-utilised compared with a year ago, but the company said they had responded to a surge in demand during the quarter.“Looking ahead, we expect solid sequential growth in the third quarter,” said Mr Templeton. The company predicted revenues of $2.5bn-$2.8bn and earnings per share of 29-39 cents.Areas of strength for TI were in its core analogue and embedded processing chip businesses.Sales of TI chips for mobile phones also improved on the first quarter, but the company has ceded leadership to Qualcomm in wireless chips. The San Diego-based company reports its earnings on Wednesday.Gross margins improved almost 1 per cent to 45.7 per cent, but were down from 52.2 per cent a year ago and still some way short of TI’s goal of 55 per cent.TI shares were down 1 per cent at $23.39 in after-hours trading in New York on the news. Shares in the company had closed 2.6 per cent higher at $23.61.
154;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-20T18:33:39Z;Moore’s Law reaches its economic limits;Costs push chipmakers towards ‘fabless’ model;A leading chip manufacturing company will break ground on a 200-acre site in upstate New York this week, starting construction on a $4.2bn state-of-the-art factory.But these days, new chip “fabs” are as rare as the April 1965 issue of Electronics Magazine.Intel paid $10,000 for a single copy of the magazine in 2005. This was the issue which featured an article by the company’s co-founder Gordon Moore, in which he predicted transistor densities on chips would continue to double, about every two years.In accordance with what we now know as Moore’s Law, we have moved from pieces of silicon with 16 transistors on them in the 1960s to ones with 600m today. More than 1m could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.Globalfoundries’ “Fab 2” in New York will achieve another level of miniaturisation when it begins volume production in 2012, making chips with circuitry just 28 billionths of a metre wide.But its construction is a rarity because of another aspect of Moore’s Law. We have yet to reach a scientific limit to further miniaturisation, but an economic one is fast approaching, according to some experts.“The high cost of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is making continued chipmaking advancements too expensive to use for volume production, relegating Moore’s Law to the laboratory and altering the fundamental economics of the industry,” wrote Len Jelinek, chief analyst for semiconductor manufacturing at the iSuppli research firm, last month.Mr Jelinek predicted that Moore’s Law would no longer drive volume chip production from 2014, sparking intense debate in Silicon Valley.His reasoning is that circuitry widths will dip to 20nm (nanometres or billionths of a metre) or below by that date. But the tools to make them would be too expensive for companies to recover their costs over the lifetime of production.The costs and risks involved in building new fabs have already driven many makers of logic chips (processor or controller chips) towards a “fabless” chip model, where they outsource much of their production to chip “foundries” in the Far East.The 14 chipmakers who were in the game at the 90nm level have been reduced to nine at the current 45nm level. Only two of them – Intel and Samsung – have firm plans for 22nm factories.Intel argues that only companies with about $9bn in annual revenues can afford to be in the business of building new fabs, given the costs of building and operating the factories and earning a decent 50 per cent margin. That leaves just Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics.Andy Bryant, Intel’s chief administrative officer, says Gordon Moore’s original article was an economics paper rather than a technical treatise.“Moore’s Law is really not about the science, it’s about the business model that the science drives,” he says. “What Gordon said was the model is driven by the cost reductions that are allowed – the science takes the technology into more and more devices and the volume will explode because the cost comes down, so it is an economic model.”So as long as demand can be maintained by consumers and businesses wanting the latest gadgets and features, Moore’s Law, and the huge investments it entails, will continue to make economic sense for fab builders.“You see a lot of companies, who can no longer afford to be in manufacturing, wanting to declare the end of Moore’s Law, but it’s not in the near future,” he says.However, with fewer companies to whom they can sell factory equipment and tools, these are tough times for big suppliers such as Applied Materials.Hans Stork, Applied’s chief technology officer, says there will have to be consolidation among chip equipment suppliers. But he sees opportunities in other segments of a chip market split three ways into logic chips, D-Ram memory and Nand flash storage.“We still see considerable upside on the storage side, there’s a lot of innovative work being done on solid-state drives to make them mainstream – that could be a big lever for us,” he says.Those chip companies priced out of the market for the next level of miniaturisation are expected to extend the life of current technology with fresh innovation and marketing ploys.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices chose to split the company, with AMD becoming a fabless chipmaker and the new Globalfoundries spun off as a fab owner to make chips for AMD and others. Globalfoundries is working with IBM and has been bankrolled by the Abu Dhabi government. Business alliances and government support are other ways that companies can compete with Intel and Samsung.“No one company or country is really going to drive this forever, I think it’s going to be collaborative in many forms that we are yet to see,” says Doug Grose, Globalfoundries chief executive.This is the second in a series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
156;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-19T18:10:22Z;Makers of chips seek a wider audience;;The financial downturn has hit the semiconductor industry hard.Orders for microchips came to an almost complete standstill at the end of 2008 as computers and mobile phones languished unsold on shop shelves.Global semiconductor sales fell 2.8 per cent last year and are expected to fall a further 21.5 per cent to $195.6bn in 2009, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, last week reported a sales revival driven by consumers buying cheaper, smaller netbooks but revenues fell in Europe and there were weaker sales recorded with business customers.The semiconductor industry is used to severe cyclical swings. It has seen six significant cycles since the 1970s, caused by global recessions and oversupply.The last one – in 2001 when the dotcom bubble burst – was worse than the current downturn with sales falling 45 per cent.But this time around, strategic issues – including soaring development costs and the intensifying need to innovate – have combined with the effects of the downturn to unleash forces that are threatening to reshape the industry completely.Crucially, the computer industry – one of the driving forces of the semiconductor sector – has been slowing, forcing companies to look elsewhere for growth.PC shipments are expected to decline 6 per cent in 2009, according to analysts at Gartner, the research company.But even without the recession, markets were growing saturated. In developed countries, 80 per cent of computers sold are replacements.In the past, Moore’s Law (see Q&A box) – the idea that the chips double their performance power roughly every two years while cutting costs in half – has driven the semiconductor industry forward.Since the invention of the silicon chip in the late-1950s, faster, cheaper chips have spurred the creation of more sophisticated computers. But as consumers become more reluctant to upgrade, Moore’s Law has become a problem.“If you can get twice as many chips from the same amount of silicon every two years, you need to double the number of computers sold every two years, or find new markets,” said Richard Doherty, research director at Envisioneering, the technology assessment and research consultancy.Intel, which has dominated the market for computer chips, has been eyeing the mobile and netbook markets as potential areas for growth.It is easy to see the temptation. Netbooks were the fastest growing segment of the computer market last year and about 1bn mobile phones are sold each year, dwarfing the 250m computers sold in the same period.Chipmakers are also looking at embedding chips into a range of devices from fridges to blood pressure monitors and television sets that could benefit from being connected to the internet.However, a switch will not be easy as the market for mobile phone chips is highly competitive and requires far smaller, more power-efficient chips than those used in the computer industry.Development costs are also becoming a burden as chips become smaller and smaller.The tiny transistors that make up chips have shrunk from 130 nanometers in 2000 to 45nm, and even 32nm, today.At 45nm, 2,000 transistors can be packed into the width of a single human hair and the cost of developing a chip using these is $20m to $50m. With 32nm technology, the costs can leap to $75m.Three European chip companies recently merged their mobile phone operations into a single group – ST Ericsson – saying they needed scale to keep up with huge research and development costs.Shane Rau, analyst at IDC said: “The manufacture of chips has become very capital-intensive .“Only companies like Intel and Samsung are able to maintain their own fabrication facilities because they have scale.”Many chip companies have closed their manufacturing units and have their chips made by specialist foundries in Asia, such as TSMC, UMC and Chartered Semiconductor.Texas Instruments is gradually leaving manufacturing, especially at the high end, and AMD, Intel’s rival on computer chips, spun out its factories into a separate company last year.Many companies may also be forced to look at a new technology roadmap beyond Moore’s Law.Some may focus on different types of chips – such as radio receivers, power control or sensors – where shrinking sizes are not the key driver.ST Microelectronics, for example, has a small but thriving part of its business making accelerometers.Or they may need to experiment with new materials and work at nano-scale – manipulating chips at the atomic level – in order to continue. Only the very biggest companies will be able to afford the investment this requires.George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said: “We are now facing the research dilemma. Will the semiconductor industry lead the transition to the era of nanotechnology – or will we go the way of the vacuum tube manufacturers?”None of the companies that made vacuum tubes for the first computers in the 1940s and 1950s survived the switch to silicon. It is a sobering thought for the sector.This is the first in a FT series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry
157;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-07-08T15:34:44Z;Valley View: A more mobile Intel must be agile;;Intel held its annual open-house Research Day for the media at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View this year, placing its impressive displays of future technologies among hardware relics of transistors past.While we admired a demonstration of how electrical power could be transmitted wirelessly in one corner, at the other end of the museum, Difference Engine No. 2 was being cranked up – a computing machine designed by Charles Babbage in 1849.Never built at the time, it was faithfully reproduced and made functional only this century.Between these two extremes, the evolution of computing could be seen in a succession of boxed circuitry in all shapes and sizes, including Digital Equipment Corporation’s groundbreaking 1959 PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1) and the Altair 8800 personal computer that inspired Bill Gates to create Microsoft.The exhibits were a reminder that tomorrow’s advances quickly become yesterday’s technologies and that many of the companies producing them are just as swiftly consigned to history.Intel’s Research Day emphasised that the world’s biggest chipmaker does not want to be haunted by the ghosts of computers past. It is moving forward at a rate of gigahertz into new markets, as growth in its core PC one slows.We heard how the Corporate Technology Group had been renamed Intel Labs and was being more closely aligned with the new sectors being eyed by the company, with a special focus on handheld devices.Among the displays, much was being made of how the compatibility of Intel’s designs would mean different kinds of devices being able to connect and collaborate with one another from server to desktop to laptop to handheld and consumer electronics set-top boxes.Variations of its low-power Atom microprocessor are being produced for the netbook, Mids (mobile internet devices), embedded and consumer electronics markets.The biggest prize for Intel would be to win significant share in the mobile phone market from rivals such as Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Freescale.At the same time, its rivals are moving into its territory, as the increasing power of their chips, based on the designs of the UK’s ARM, makes them good candidates for computing machines of decreasing sizes, from smartphones to Mids and whatever the future holds.This convergence of chipmakers, low-powered microprocessors and mobile devices threatens a conflagration of competition and – as with any impending war – Intel has been plotting its strategy, building its arsenal and creating alliances.It has invested substantially in software – focusing its research, strengthening its in-house teams, funding open-source mobile software and making acquisitions.It paid $884m in cash for Wind River Systems last month, a software company that should help its push into mobile.It had earlier acquired OpenedHand, a leading handset user-experience company and in May, it introduced Moblin, a new open-source operating system designed for smaller devices.This year, it announced an alliance with TSMC, the Taiwanese chip foundry, for Atom, and last month, agreed a strategic partnership with Nokia, which will give it an entry into the smartphone market and access to its 3G wireless technology.This is crucial. Intel has done well with Wi-Fi [short-range wireless networks] in notebooks, but its WiMax standard for wider areas has made little headway so far and Intel has lacked a partner to combine its wireless chips with 3G ones.In contrast, analysts expect Qualcomm-based netbooks to appear in the coming months with integrated 3G/Wi-Fi connectivity, instant-on capabilities, 10-hour battery life and lower costs because of better chip-level integration.With Intel backing open-source Moblin, some also expect Qualcomm to announce a partnership with Microsoft for Windows 7, its new operating system, to run on Qualcomm netbooks. The rupturing of the “Wintel” alliance and creation of Wincomm would indeed be a sign of changing times.In the meantime, Intel may not be in a good position to challenge as a smartphone chip supplier until 2011, when a smaller version of Atom is ready.Intel may be able to achieve success and market share with its considerable resources, but I have been surprised at the number of analysts who give it little chance of making a big impact on these unfolding markets.There is also the size and strength of the opposition.Intel faces not just big players such as Qualcomm, but scores of smaller ones, particularly in Asia, that are leveraging ARM’s designs and quickly improving on them to bring out new devices.Intel will have to be more mobile in every sense to keep up with the pace of change.
158;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-29T19:54:26Z;Europe set for standard mobile phone chargers;;The hours spent combing the office to find a mobile phone charger to fit your handset will soon be over, after much of the European Union’s telecoms industry committed on Monday to producing a common charger. In addition to reducing consumer frustration, the move by 10 of the main manufacturers should also cut down on waste when old chargers are thrown away.The European Commission estimates that old chargers create “several thousand tons” of waste annually. Manufacturers supporting the move include Apple, LG, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, Research in Motion, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments. The move may also cut long-run costs for consumers because they will be able to buy new phones without chargers, as well as more cost-effective standalone chargers. Günter Verheugen, EU industry commissioner, said the manufacturers agreed to harmonise chargers in the EU in a memorandum of understanding submitted to the European Commission.Brussels’ backing should accelerate existing efforts by the mobile phone industry to simplify its chargers. An alliance of 17 device manufacturers and mobile operators, led by the GSM Association, a trade body, in February pledged to adopt the same charger technology as standard. Mobile operators have been pushing for such a move for even longer.The deal, which covers only the EU area, followed threats of legislation if a voluntary solution could not be found. It will apply to “data-enabled” mobile phones – which can be plugged into a computer to exchange pictures and files. The first generation of “inter-chargeable” phones should be in the high street from 2010, the Commission said. In most cases, they will charge within two hours,“The days of drawers full of useless old mobile phone chargers will soon be over …It is particularly welcome that the Commission was able to reach agreement with the industry without introducing new regulation,” said Malcolm Harbour, a British Conservative MEP.But while consumer groups welcomed the progress, they ex­pressed disappointment the deal did not cover the entire market – in terms of both phones and manufacturers. Beuc, the umbrella group for national consumer associations, said the problem was not confined to phone chargers but embraced other portable electronic equipment, such as MP3 players.
159;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-26T22:16:31Z;Apple raises Imagination Technologies stake;;Apple has raised its stake in Imagination Technologies, a British designer of microchips used in laptops and smartphones, marking the latest escalation in a recent buying spree for shares in the Hertfordshire-based group.The increased stake takes Apple’s holding to 9.5 per cent and follows a surge in trading in recent weeks that saw exchange volumes for the group’s stock surge 90-fold as Apple and Intel snapped up shares. Shares in Imagination have risen by 60 per cent since the start of June and have trebled since December.Imagination is of strategic importance to Intel and Apple, who license design technology from the group and use it in chips that go into laptops and mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhone.Intel holds 10 licences from Imagination and last week bought £20m of Imagination’s shares from Saad, the troubled investment group, taking its stake to 16 per cent. Intel is targeting the mobile phone and television markets and is keen to use Imagination’s graphics capabilities.While both companies have increased their holdings, analysts doubt that either Intel or Apple will make an outright bid for Imagination. They argue that complete ownership of the group by any one company might upset many of Imagination’s other customers who could then turn away from its designs.Because Imagination is of more value to its customers if it remains independent, Apple and Intel are taking stakes to ensure that they could prevent any one group from taking control.“These are forward-looking companies, they see key technologies and they want to make sure that they have all options open,” said Arun George at Noble Securities.Imagination makes just over half of its £64m in annual sales from chip designing. The remainder comes from sales of its Pure-branded consumer electronics such as internet radios and digital media players, down by 10 per cent this year as consumers tightened their belts.The shares closed down 3p at 139¾p.
160;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-23T23:56:47Z;Nokia and Intel strike research deal;;Intel and Nokia unveiled plans on Tuesday to work together to create a type of mobile computing device beyond today’s smartphones and netbooks.The move takes Intel a step further towards a breakthrough into the highly prized mobile phone market. Nokia typically works with potential suppliers on joint research for several years before deciding to adopt a particular technology.For Intel, a partnership with a leading mobile player is crucial to adoption of its chips although the announcement suggested the groups would focus on niche products initially in categories of devices yet to be developed.“We believe that this will allow us to create an entire new category of devices,” Kai Öistämö, Nokia executive vice-president in charge of the group’s devices unit, told a media conference call. “The mobile and computing industries are coming together and we, as leaders in our respective industries, are taking the responsibility to really be the enablers to create this brave new world.”His counterpart, Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice-president of Intel’s ultra mobility group, described the partnership as “this year’s most significant collaboration in our respective industries”.However, the announcement was short on detail about any specific devices. “This is a technology collaboration. It is premature to talk of products,” said Mr Öistämö.Intel’s microprocessors run about 80 per cent of the world’s personal computers but the US group has struggled to enter the mobile market. In 2006, Paul Otellini, chief executive, scrapped a $5bn investment in chips for mobile devices.Recently, however, the company has been looking at the mobile device market again to reduce its dependence on PC chips, which account for 90 per cent of sales.The mobile phone chip industry is dominated by companies such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, which make chips based on designs by Arm, the UK semiconductor company, and are about a quarter of the size and power consumption of Intel’s Ato.Intel has said that, by 2011, it could have a much smaller chip for use in smartphones.
161;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-12T20:43:55Z;Wall Street rebounds in late trade;;Wall Street stocks erased most of their early losses on Friday, but they failed to break out of the week’s narrow trading range on a day when floor trading in 242 companies, including Exxon Mobil and General Electric, was halted because of a computer problem.Stocks rebounded in late trade as early indications filtered through that Mir Hossein Mousavi, the challenger to President Mahjmoud Ahmedi-Nejad, might be on course to win a majority of the vote.The broad market had been subdued all week, as surging commodities lifted energy and materials stocks, but squeezed the consumer sector.Oil peaked at more than $73 a barrel on Thursday, but then fell back again on Friday. Its movement was matched by that of leading energy producers.Schlumberger rose 8.6 per cent in the first four sessions of the week, but fell 3.1 per cent on Friday to $60.27. ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $44.37.Metal producers also lost some of the week’s gains as the boom in prices for their products slowed. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 3.2 per cent to $58.51. AK Steel, the steel maker that has surged over 13 per cent this week, fell 5.7 per cent to $19.93.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.1 per cent at 946.21, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,799.26, pushing the blue chip benchmark into positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.2 per cent to 1,858.80 points.“We’ve had a really good run up on commodities and there is a certain amount of covering positions ahead of the weekend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.“Some managers will also be looking to lock in profits before the end of the quarter.”That left the S&P 0.7 per cent ahead of where it closed last week, while the Dow rose 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent.The market spent the week focused on interest rates and the threat of inflation as climbing commodity prices were further fuelled by a falling dollar and climbing bond yields.Last week’s better-than-expected fall in non-farm payrolls triggered worries that an improving economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.“Inflation is a serious threat, perhaps not in three to six months, but in 12 to 18 months, and we have been investing in inflation protection assets,” said Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial.BlackRock finally confirmed its $13.5bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors on Thursday to create the world’s largest money manager.The impending deal had been widely reported during the week, sending BlackRock’s shares up 5 per cent.The final price was a shade over the $13bn that had been reported, however, which sent BlackRock’s shares down 3.3 per cent at $176.56.The company was also hit by a downgrade in its credit rating from S&P following the deal, which will give it an extra $3bn of debt.Elsewhere in the sector, Hartford Financial, the insurer and financial services company, said it would take $3.4bn in government bail-out money and sell $750m of stock amid what it called a “continued uncertain economic environment”. This sent the company’s shares down 8 per cent to $12.95.In the technology sector, National Semiconductor shares fell after it reported a loss.The microchip maker had better sales than expected, but had to pay $100m in restructuring costs, leading to a worse loss than had been predicted.Its shares dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.59.Other microchip companies suffered. Texas Instruments lost 0.2 per cent to $20.79 while market leader Intel gave up 0.2 per cent to $16.31.
162;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-09T20:51:29Z;US investors turn to materials and energy stocks;;"US equities edged upwards but stayed within the narrow range of the past six sessions as rising commodities and a slipping dollar failed to spark significant buying.Metal producers fared well as prices for their products rose. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."

The shares had fallen 43.6 per cent in the previous session.Although possible insolvency has been rumoured for days, the market had not fully priced in the event, traders said.“In the last day, there have been so many news headlines and rumours about what could happen and investors said as long as the company doesn’t actually file for insolvency, there was a small chance that Arcandor could be saved,” said Thomas Nagel of Equinet. “Tuesday’s news and rumours were indicators that insolvency was on the way, before that they were looking for a last hope,” he added.Arcandor shares have fallen more than 83 per cent since January.Insolvency rumours also sent shares in Heidelberger Druckmaschinen down 10.3 per cent to €4.55. The German printing press maker warned that the company may have to file for insolvency if it does not receive aid from the German government.Overall, yesterday European bourses were mixed.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.5 per cent to 869.56 and France’s CAC 40 index was up 0.2 per cent to 3,296.73. Germany’s Xetra Dax fell 0.1 per cent to 4,997.86.Danone shares were up 4.8 per cent to €34.57. The French dairy group received approval from the Indian government to invest in food and beverage businesses after it gave up its stakes in other local companies.Royal Dutch Shell shares were up 0.3 per cent to €19.48 on the back of stronger oil prices, still nosing towards $70 a barrel.OMV, the Austrian oil and gas company, rose 1.8 per cent to €29.32 and Norway’s StatoilHydro rose 0.9 per cent to NKr135.00.Technology shares were higher after Texas Instruments raised its targets for second-quarter earnings and revenue on Monday.Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, was up 3.7 per cent to €11.28.Credit Suisse said in a note to clients: “Given positive comments from Texas Instruments around sequential growth in all segments …we believe these comments are a slight positive for the overall handset market and Nokia in particular.”STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest chipmaker, gained 3.9 per cent to €5.54 and Infineon, the German chipmaker, rose 2.9 per cent to €2.52.Shares in Irish banks were volatile after large losses in the previous session after Standard and Poor’s downgraded the long-term sovereign credit ratings for the Irish Republic.Allied Irish Banks fell 2.5 per cent to €1.94 and Bank of Ireland rose 2.1 per cent to €1.96.Elsewhere in the sector, Spain’s Bankinter rose 8.8 per cent to €9.66, making it the biggest gainer on the Eurofirst.DnB Nor, Norway’s largest bank, rose 5.5 per cent to NKr53.70 and Mediobanca was up 3 per cent to €9.18.Air France-KLM fell 5.2 per cent to €9.93 on news the airline’s passenger traffic fell 8.1 per cent in May. RBS cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold.”Carmakers were mixed after the US Supreme Court delayed the sale of Chrysler to Italy’s Fiat late on Monday.Fiat shares fell 1.4 per cent to €7.43. Renault lost 2.1 per cent to €28.95 and Daimler was down 1.4 per cent to €26.42.Volkswagen shares were up 2.5 per cent to €254.18 as VW’s parent company Porsche explored a possible investment deal with Qatar to help relieve its debt.

164;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-06-08T16:16:39Z;ST Ericsson eyes growth in US and China;;Alain Dutheil, chief executive of ST Ericsson, is looking to the North American and Chinese markets to generate growth and pull the newly created European mobile chipmaker into profit.In particular, Mr Dutheil would like to get ST Ericsson’s chips into future versions of Apple’s iPhone, or Research in Motion’s BlackBerry. Apple currently uses chips from ST Ericsson’s German rival Infineon, while the latest BlackBerrys use Qualcomm chips.“We have no American companies among our top five customers. We need to convince them to work with us,” Mr Dutheil said.In China, ST Ericsson had a recent coup in being selected by China Mobile as a partner for developing handsets for China’s domestic 3G phone standard, TD-SCDMA.“China is the one place where the market is really picking up today,” Mr Dutheil said. “The Chinese government has initiatives to restart consumption and there are big investments by telecoms operators. Development of the TD-SCDMA standard is boosting demand and we are now well positioned with Chinese suppliers.”Mr Dutheil is under intense pressure to find growth opportunities for the company. Last week, it announced plans to cut 146 jobs in France and wind down operations at its plant in Caen, France, in response to poor market conditions.ST Ericsson was created four months ago as a joint venture combining the chipmaking operations of ST Microelectronics and Ericsson. The plan was to create a large-scale European entity to compete with large US companies such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, which dominate the wireless chip sector.ST Ericsson is the world’s number two by mobile chip sales, but it got off to an inauspicious start as the market for mobile handsets and their components collapsed at the end of 2008. One of the first things Mr Dutheil had to do in April, just two months into the job, was announce 1,200 job losses. The company made an $89m operating loss in the first two months, and he is reluctant to predict when it will be out of the red.“With our restructuring plan it is possible to reach break-even in the second quarter of 2010, but I am not saying we will. It depends on whether we can get topline growth, and it depends on the market.”If ST Ericsson, which had $358m cash at the end of April, is unable to reach break-even, it may be forced to call on its parent companies for more cash. Such a move could be particularly unpalatable for Ericsson, which is already facing calls to support Sony Ericsson, its struggling mobile handset manufacturing venture with Sony.
165;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-04-30T16:38:41Z;European chipmakers hopeful of summer upturn;;European chipmakers on Thursday made cautious forecasts for a upturn in the current quarter, after reporting falling revenues for the beginning of 2009.Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of ST Microelectronics, Europe’s largest semiconductor company, said there were signs of a demand picking up in Asia, except for Japan.Alain Dutheil, chief executive of ST Ericsson, a joint venture between Ericsson and ST Microelectronics and the world’s second largest maker of wireless chips, said he had seen a similar increase in demand in Asia, particularly in China.Peter Bauer, chief executive of Germany’s Infineon, meanwhile, said he expected the company’s sales to increase by 10 per cent in the quarter ending in June compared with the first three months of the year, driven particularly by demand for mobile phone chips.The comments came after Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a sector bellwether, forecast strong growth in second quarter sales and raised its forecast for global chip demand in 2009. Texas Instruments in the US also gave a more positive outlook last month, and Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker said the glut of unsold mobile phones that had depressed sales earlier in the year was beginning to ease.Nevertheless, all three European chip companies remained cautious about the outlook for 2009, with ST Micro forecasting a 25 per cent decline in global chip sales. ST Ericsson expects unit sales of mobile chips to fall 10-12 per cent in 2009, and Infineon revised down its own sales estimates for the year, forecasting a 20 per cent sales drop. Previous expectations were for a 15-20 per cent decline.“It is clear that the global economic environment deteriorated further during the first quarter of 2009. While we have recently begun to see some indicators of improvement in booking activity and visibility, we believe it is still too early to determine how sustainable these signs are across all applications and geographies,” Mr Bozotti said.“The destocking phase is substantially over, and we will return to a more normal pattern of orders. But but we have yet to see signs of a broad-based pick-up of demand in our industry,” said Mr Dutheil.Mr Bauer said the manufacturing slump and the resulting lack of demand for chips would affect Infineon for the rest of the year. It faced “considerable uncertainties”, not least because carmakers in Europe and the US would continue to suffer.While manufacturers may have started to order chips again after freezing the supply chain in the fourth quarter, the big question remained whether there will be any increase in demand for goods by end consumers, said Didier Scemama, semiconductor analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.Results for the first three months of the year made for dismal reading. ST Microelectronics reported a loss of $541m, its fifth consecutive quarterly loss and a substantial widening from the $84m loss it made this time last year. Sales fell 33 per cent to $1.66bn.ST Micro cut 3,200 jobs in the first quarter, and is aiming to cuts costs by $700m this year through headcount reduction and other measures.ST Ericsson, which was created in February, made a net loss of $89m in its first two months of operation on sales of $391m, and announced 1,200 job cuts, mainly in Europe.Infineon suffered a net loss of €258m in January, February and March, an improvement on the €1.96bn loss it made in the same period the year before. The year-ago period, however, included writing off the value of its stake in memory-chip maker Qimonda. Sales in Infineon’s second fiscal quarter declined 10 per cent to €747m.The German group had no further details on how it plans to refinance some €900m in loans and bonds which fall due over the next 18 months. The company signalled at the start of the year it was having trouble with refinancing and indicated it was mulling talking to the German government about a credit guarantee. However, Mr Bauer declined to comment on whether he since had had talks with the government in Berlin.Marco Schroeter, chief financial officer, said the company had not breached any covenants on loans, a first of which comes due this autumn.Shares in ST Micro rose 1.12 per cent to €5.06, while Infineon shares rose 4.21 per cent to €1.98.
166;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.

The rich are allowed to join in if they cough up for the privilege. Then the real fortunes are made when the hoi polloi are queuing round the corner. Eventually, though, everybody has a fondue set.Consider the current enthusiasm for smartphones, likely to feature heavily at the annual industry shindig in Barcelona starting on Monday. The success of Apple’s iPhone has moved the category from the functional to the highly desirable, allowing manufacturers to charge a premium for the features and hardware on offer. Telecoms operators are also shifting handset subsidies towards the devices – quite rationally, as they can sign customers up for lucrative data services. IDC, a research group, estimates that while the global handset market will shrink slightly from the 1.22bn phones sold in 2008 to 1.2bn this year, smartphones will be a ray of light. Defined as devices capable of running third-party software, it forecasts that smartphone unit shipments will increase by 9 per cent to 172m.However, the secret is out. In the latest round of results almost every handset maker or component supplier struggling with the recession, from HTC and Motorola to Texas Instruments and Samsung, has pointed to the segment as a source of growth. This leaves profit expectations at risk of disappointment, as proliferating devices with clever touch screens put pressure on average selling prices, shrinking the premium. Striking exclusive deals with phone operators can also mean greater marketing expense – probably part of the reason behind the shrinking margins Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, reported last week.Scale, as ever, will help. Nokia, with well-developed software and marketing muscle, will continue to press its cost advantage. Apple has a knack for maintaining profitable niches.

168;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-02-02T21:40:49Z;Wall Street downbeat on stimulus fears;;Industrial stocks were among the hardest hit on Wall Street on Monday as the market struggled to mount a recovery from its worst January on record.Investors took scant comfort from the latest reading of US manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management, which although better than expected was nevertheless glum.The industrial sector led the declines, down 2.5 per cent overall. Among the hardest hit big names, Boeingand 3M dropped 3.6 per cent to $40.80 and 5.9 per cent to $50.62, respectively.The major indices finished mixed after a choppy session in relatively thin trade. The S&P 500 drifted between positive and negative territory throughout the day, yet the benchmark index finished 0.1 per cent lower at 825.43 despite a wave of buying into the close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.8 per cent lower at 7,936.75, a fresh low for the year. Yet strength in the relatively cash-rich technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite stand 1.2 per cent higher at 1,494.43.“That’s more about short-covering than anything else,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman. “The earnings have lived down to expectations.”Semiconductor stocks did particularly well. Intel and Texas Instruments finished up 5.7 per cent at $13.63 and 5 per cent to $15.69 overall.Elsewhere, however, a succession of corporate results once again highlighted the damage that the recession – now more than a year old – had done to company performance.Consumer stocks did badly, hurt by a glum corporate outlooks from Mattel and Macy’s.An unexpected 46 per cent plunge in profit at Mattel, which sank 16.1 per cent to $11.90, hurt Hasbro, a peer, which lost 9.1 per cent to $21.93.Macy’s lost 4 per cent to $8.59 after the retailer cut its dividend from 13.5 cents to 5 cents a share and disclosed plans to cut about 7,000 jobs.Among other consumer stocks to perform poorly, Procter&Gamble shed 2.7 per cent to $53.05 after Barclays cut its price target to $58 and maintained its “equal weight” stance.Avon Products dipped 5.4 per cent to $19.34 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “buy” list ahead of its results.“The cost of doing business is likely to fall owing to pressure on commodities and advertising rates [but] Avon has limited exposure to these favourable trends,” wrote the analysts.The latest economic data came as concerns heightened that political wrangling would delay the economic stimulus package weighed on the wider market.Talks continued in Washington over the passage of the Obama administration’s near-$900bn stimulus plan, which is facing opposition from leading Republican senators who have called for further tax cuts along with other changes to the bill.Meanwhile, the financial sector – which outperformed the market last week as hopes mounted that the Obama administration would avoid outright nationalisation of key financial institutions and set up a so-called bad bank to take on their toxic assets – struggled for momentum.Investors were concerned that the White House had yet to disclose details of the plan and the sector was also hit by a Moody’s downgrade of the credit ratings on Barclays, the British bank.Among the big name banks, Bank of America shed 8.8 per cent to $6 even after S&P Equity Research, which previously forecast a full-year loss, adjusted its estimate to earnings of 47 cents a share.Regional banks also did particularly poorly, down 3.9 per cent overall.Also among the worst performing in the wider sector, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX tumbled 12.4 per cent to $19.28 and 6.2 per cent to $20.47, respectively, on a bearish view from Goldman Sachs.The financial sector overall spent much of the session in the red but stood 0.2 per cent higher by the close.Elsewhere, the energy sector came under pressure, down 0.9 per cent overall, as US crude prices slid.Healthcare and utilities – defensive areas – outperformed as investors sought safety.The market’s downbeat start to the month followed a 8.6 per cent drop in the S&P 500 in January, which was even worse than the 7.7 per cent fall in the benchmark index during January 1970.
169;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-01-27T22:38:32Z;Overview: Cautious US advance as Europe struggles;;Wall Street managed a cautious advance on Tuesday but European equity markets struggled to build on Monday’s strong gains as investors digested mixed economic and earnings data.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent on Tuesday, helped by better than expected results from American Express and Texas Instruments.This was in spite of US consumer confidence falling to an all-time low in January and also in spite of a record year on year fall of 18.2 per cent in US house prices in November. Dimitry Fleming, of ING, warned that there was “little to no prospect of US [property] prices stabilising near term” and said continued distress in the housing market would bring further downward pressure on banks’ credit portfolios.In London, the FTSE 100 index slipped 0.4 per cent, amid weakness in the oil and mining sectors.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index inched 0.1 per cent higher as analysts welcomed Germany’s Ifo survey as “a ray of hope” after an unexpected rise in the headline business climate index in January.Martin Lueck, economist at UBS, said three months of better Ifo data were needed before it was possible to say that a turnround in a “normal” business cycle had occurred.“Should the Ifo bottom out, this could be a clear signal to investors to believe the most severe drop in equity prices is also behind us.”Japan’s stock market rebounded from Monday’s three-month low with the Nikkei 225 Average up 4.9 per cent after the government announced a $17bn scheme to offer funds to companies hit by the credit crunch.The Japanese bond market reacted calmly to news of the government’s plans as investors awaited Wednesday’s outcome of the US Federal Reserve meeting. The benchmark JGB 10-year yield rose 4 basis points to 1.26 per cent, helped by a smooth Y900bn ($10.04bn) 20-year debt auction.India’s stock market rallied 3.9 per cent after being closed for a holiday on Monday. After cutting its key policy interest rate by 100bp in early January, India’s central bank kept its rates unchanged at 5.5 per cent in spite of trimming its gross domestic product growth forecast (for the current fiscal year from between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent to 7 per cent) and warning that the year ahead would be challenging.Stock markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea remained closed for holidays.In fixed income markets Tuesday’s largest ever auction of two-year notes at $40bn met solid demand with the new issue sold at a yield of 0.925 per cent. Treasury prices rallied after the debt sale and the current US two-year note fell 2bp to 0.81 per cent, down from 0.87 per cent before the auction. The 10-year note yield was 10bp lower at 2.54 per cent, down from a peak of 2.68 per cent on Monday.Traders said long term investors favoured the 10-year note after the two-year sale was completed.The sharp rise in US 10-year bond yields since December’s record low of 2.035 per cent has been accompanied by mounting speculation that the US central bank might signal it will start buying long-term Treasuries. Policymakers in effect have no room to cut the main policy interest rate any further.Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, said that by buying long-term Treasury bonds in conjunction with the Fed’s other programmes, the central bank would hope to influence yields in the wide range of markets that it viewed as important for economic recovery.Francesco Garzarelli, of Goldman Sachs, said spending money in support of private credit markets still seemed to offer the US authorities a bigger “bang for the buck” than buying Treasuries.In Europe, a narrowing of sovereign credit default spreads supported a better tone for other European bond markets. The yield on the 10-year German bund, Europe’s benchmark, fell 7bp to 3.26 per cent.In commoditiesgold traded around $900 a troy ounce but base metals weakened with copper down 5 per cent. Brent crude fell $3.23 at $43.73 a barrel.In currency marketsthe euro enjoyed initial support because of the better-than-expected Ifo data but later trimmed gains against the dollar.
170;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-01-27T21:52:57Z;Wall St sees glimmer of hope in earnings;;Financial stocks were the winners on Wall Street on Tuesday as some corporate earnings that were not as bad as feared helped the wider market extend the previous session’s modest gains.The market opened higher after figures from American Express and Texas Instruments offered a glimmer of hope that investors’ worst fears – at least for some companies – may have been excessive.The rally came even though other results and the latest economic data suggested a bleak outlook for corporate earnings. Bullish observers took that as a sign that the market had stopped reacting to bad news.Consumer confidence fell to a record low in January, according to data from the Conference Board. The S&P/Case Shiller index, a closely watched reading of US house prices, dropped in November at the fastest rate on record. Homebuilder stocks lost 2.4 per cent overall.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent to 845.70, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7 per cent higher at 8,174.73 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1 per cent higher at 1,504.90 points.Financials led the advance, up 3.7 per cent overall. American Express, which was among several key financial losers in the previous session, bounced 9.7 per cent to $16.68 after the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings that was nevertheless better than the most pessimistic fears.Still, Donald Fandetti, Citigroup analyst, maintained his “sell” view of the stock.“We could see some short covering as the bear-case for Q4 did not play out, though we’d expect concerns around spending and credit to ultimately push the shares lower,” he said.Among the several banks to bounce back on Tuesday, Bank of America rallied 8.3 per cent to $6.50 and Citigroup 6.6 per cent to $3.55.Travelers, the insurer, rose 6.2 per cent to $39.89 on better-than-expected earnings. Financial stocks have swung violent in recent sessions as volatility has returned to Wall Street.“While a good deal of bad news is already priced into the market and some stocks have been rising on bad news, we are still seeing too many stocks fall on disappointing results,” wrote options strategists at Goldman Sachs.“This leads us to believe that downward revisions of the magnitude we are looking for will cause further volatility.”Elsewhere, well-received figures from Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 4 per cent to $23.13, gave the pharmaceuticals sector a boost.Healthcare also did well, up 2 per cent overall, on the back of better than expected results from St Jude Medical, which rose 11.1 per cent to $35.21.Other stocks in the sector rallied after RBC analysts initiated coverage on several companies in the sector with an “outperform” view.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rallied 3.7 per cent to $15.31 on better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although the technology group warned that it could report a loss in its first quarter.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 3.7 per cent overall, also pushed higher after an upbeat assessment of the sector by Citigroup’s Glen Yeung.“The potential for a bottom has been created,” he said. “Chip stocks have not gone down on bad news.” The technology sector edged 1.2 per cent higher overall.Investors took some comfort from the confirmation of Timothy Geithner as US Treasury secretary. “Bullish sentiment still surrounds the economic stimulus plan,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets.Among the more downbeat results, Dupont disclosed a slightly bigger than expected fourth-quarter loss and gloomier earnings outlook for the year. Shares in the chemical maker edged 0.4 per cent higher to $23.27.Elsewhere in materials, US Steel rallied 6.9 per cent to $31.49 on well-received fourth-quarter figures.Telecommunications was one of only two main economic sectors to lose ground. Verizon fell 3.3 per cent to $29.96 as the group’s fourth-quarter profit trailed some expectations.The lower oil price afforded scant comfort to the airlines, which did badly in the wake of downbeat results from Delta Air Lines. Delta shares dived 20.1 per cent to $7.93 as its fourth-quarter loss widened while the Amex Airline Index dropped 6.9 per cent.
171;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-01-27T09:21:24Z;Gloom deepens as 76,000 jobs go in a day;;Corporate bellwethers in the US and Europe on Monday slashed more than 76,000 jobs from their payrolls to confront the deepening economic downturn, marking one of the most brutal days yet for workers on both sides of the Atlantic.US corporate groups such as Caterpillar, General Motors, Sprint Nextel. Texas Instruments, and Home Depot led the retreat, as the domestic recession coupled with tough export markets continued to take a heavy toll on their businesses. Pfizer, the drugs group, added to the tally saying jobs would be lost in its takeover of Wyeth.Large European companies such as Philips, the Dutch electronics company, financial group ING and the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which is owned by India’s Tata Group, struck the same downbeat tone as they unveiled plans to axe staff.In many cases, the cutbacks accompanied disappointing quarterly results or bleak outlooks for 2009, when many of the world’s largest economies are expected to be hit by severe downturns.Raymond Torres, head of the International Labour Organisation’s research institute, said employers were shedding workers far more quickly in this recession than in the early 1990s.“We have a vicious circle of depression, where job losses lead to falling consumption, which lowers industrial confidence, which leads to less investment, which results in more job losses, and so on,” he said.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, said it would cut 20,000 jobs as it reported fourth-quarter profits more than 32 per cent lower than a year ago and warned earnings would be under pressure in 2009. The news comes a month after the US group slashed executive salaries by up to half and cut jobs at large plants.Sprint Nextel, the US mobile-phone operator, is to cut 8,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, while DIY retailer Home Depot is shedding 7,000 posts and freezing salaries as it battles a consumer slowdown in the US.Pfizer said 19,500 people would lose their jobs after its takeover of US rival Wyeth, while General Motors, the troubled carmaker, announced 2,000 job losses at two plants in Michigan. After the US markets closed, chipmaker Texas Instruments eliminated 3,400 positions. The news in the US came after ING said it would axe 7,000 of its 130,000 global staff and Philips announced the loss of 6,000 jobs as it accelerated restructuring plans.Corus, Britain’s largest steelmaker, announced cuts of 3,500 from its global workforce of 41,000, with more than 2,000 jobs to go in the UK where it employs 20,000.News of job cuts continued on Tuesday, with Clariant, the Swiss speciality chemicals maker, shedding 1,000 jobs in sales and administration. The group, which currently employs over 20,000 people, announced a 5 per cent decline in full-year sales.Reporting by Justin Baer and Francesco Guerrera in New York, Andrew Ward in Washington, Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Richard Milne in London and Frances Williams in Geneva

173;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Fall in chip sales hits Texas Instruments;;Texas Instruments, the world’s third largest chipmaker, reported lower sales and announced layoffs on Monday as demand in all its key markets continued to weaken.Fourth-quarter sales fell to $2.49bn, or 8 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 11 cents. Quarterly profit fell to $107m from $756m a year ago.However, the profit decrease was smaller than expected and shares were up 5 per cent in after-hours trading. Annual income fell 10 per cent to $12.5bn, primarily because of falling sales in the wireless segment.TI announced a 12 per cent reduction in its workforce, with 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 voluntary retirements. The company will take a $300m charge for the cuts but the move, with other measures, will save about $700m a year.“We are realigning our expenses with a global economy that continues to weaken,” Rich Templeton, chief executive, said in a statement.TI had anticipated poor results. In December, the Dallas-based company issued reduced forecasts for the fourth quarter, predicting sales of about $2.4bn – down from initial expectations of $2.9bn.“The current environment is not simply an inventory correction that will work itself out in three quarters,” said Ron Slaymaker, vice-president of investor relations.Other chipmakers, including Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, have already reported slumping sales as demand continues to weaken.TI warned it could post losses for the current quarter as demand, especially for its mobile phone chips, remains weak.“We are not anticipating an upturn any time on the horizon,” said Kevin March, chief financial officer.TI’s dominance in the mobile phone chip market is under threat. Last year Nokia, its largest customer, shifted to a multi-supplier strategy and began sourcing from TI’s rivals Broadcom and STMicroelectronics.

175;TXN;Texas Instruments;2009-01-07T19:30:34Z;Intel issues second warning on revenues;;"Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, on Wednesday warned on its fourth-quarter sales for a second time due to a further erosion of demand as a result of the global downturn.The company had cut its revenue expectations by 14 per cent in a November warning but on Wednesday said the decline would be 20 per cent.Intel’s bellwether status suggested its new forecast would mean other companies had also suffered from a dramatic cutback in technology spending in the last three months of 2008.The fact that Intel has adjusted its estimates twice for the same quarter, outside of a scheduled mid-quarter update, indicates that the decline has been rapid and unexpected.The Silicon Valley company said it now anticipated revenues of $8.2bn, down 20 per cent compared with the third quarter and down 23 per cent on the year.It said that this was “a result of further weakness in end demand and inventory reductions by its customers in the global PC supply chain”.Intel shares were down 3.5 per cent in midday trading in New York at $14.81 after earlier falling more than 6 per cent. The wider Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices had fallen by more than 2 per cent.As well as component inventories being aggressively reduced by its immediate customers in the PC supply chain, Intel blamed “significantly weaker-than- expected demand in all geographies and market segments.”It had also reduced its gross margin expectations from 59 per cent to about
55 per cent. On Wednesday it said gross margins should be “at the bottom of the
previous expectation of 55 per cent, plus or minus a couple of points”.Last month, Texas Instruments, the world’s third largest chipmaker, issued drastically reduced forecasts for its fourth quarter, predicting sales of about $2.4bn – down from expectations of $2.9bn. TI blamed lower demand across all leading product areas.The group said that its factories were running at capacity levels not seen since 2001 when the technology bubble burst and Intel’s revenue fall appears to be greater than the 20 per cent drop experienced seven years earlier. Rival Advanced Micro Devices has predicted a 25 per cent revenue drop.Intel also announced that it would record an impairment charge of nearly $1bn in its fourth quarter for its investment in the mobile operator Clearwire.Intel said there would be a non-cash charge of about $950m and, with other equity investments and interest, it expected a total impairment of $1.1bn to $1.2bn, compared with earlier expectations of just $50m.Intel became a significant stakeholder in Clearwire in order to further the Wimax standard for broadband wireless. It sees Wimax as a natural evolution of its existing wi-fi chipset business."
176;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-12-21T19:02:52Z;Christmas shut-down in Silicon Valley;;Workers at some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies will find themselves spending an uncommonly long time with their families this Christmas as the technology industry responds to the downturn with office and factory closures and enforced holidays.Usually limited to traditional manufacturing industries such as the ailing carmakers, the year-end shut-down is this year sweeping through the office suites and research and development labs of information-age companies.Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instruments, Dell, Adobe and CSC are among the tech industry heavyweights to be taking a break, with some closed from December 22 until January 5.HP said: “The only workers left to keep the lights on will be those involved in “critical customer support”.The shut-down has been forced by belt-tightening across the sector as corporate and individual customers cut back on spending.The wider cost-cutting has hit even Google, the latest emblem of Silicon Valley prosperity. The internet seach engine has trimmed spending on its famed perks with steps such as cutting the number of restaurants on its campus open in the evening.In spite of the enforced leisure, workers will be hit directly by the closures, with most required to use up part of their holiday entitlement or, if they do not have the days to spare, take unpaid leave.Given that many US workers receive only 10 days of vacation a year, the effect will be biggest there, although most of the companies to close say they will be halting operations worldwide.HP said six days of its two-week shutdown would count against workers’ annual vacation entitlement, while technology services company CSC said employees would be docked seven days’ holiday.One Valley executive said: “Man, is it ugly out there”.He said the pain had spread from the wider economy in recent weeks. “It was nice to see record earnings for high-tech companies in the first three quarters during a so-called recession, and then the wheels fell off in October.”Chip companies and other component makers have taken the brunt of the initial downturn in tech demand, as makers of hardware such as computers and routers have reduced orders in anticipation of deeper problems next year.The iSuppli research company warned last week that excess semiconductor stockpiles in the global electronics supply chain were likely to nearly triple in the fourth quarter.Advanced Micro Devices, the microprocessor maker based in Silicon Valley, said its workforce had been told to take five days’ mandatory vacation in the fourth quarter.Elsewhere, Texas Instruments is temporarily closing many of its factories to run down its inventories. With its manufacturing operation running at only about 45 per cent of capacity, the Dallas-based company says such levels had not been seen since the second half of 2001.

178;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-12-09T22:44:55Z;Chips are down;;"A climber descending into a darkened cave wants to reach the bottom before he runs out of rope. It is the same for semiconductor companies. Texas Instruments has joined the roll-call of chipmakers that have again had to downgrade expectations. It indicated that fourth quarter revenues will be 26-32 per cent lower than those of the previous quarter. Similar in magnitude to revised forecasts from peers such as AMD and TSMC, it makes guidance from Intel, released just weeks ago, look optimistic.The problems are twofold. First, consumer spending has collapsed. Taiwanese computer makers are bracing themselves for desktop sales down by a quarter in the final three months of the year, reckons Bank of America. So, as they adjust along with other manufacturers of consumer electronics, this creates the second effect – shrinking inventories. Texas Instruments is shipping chips at a rate below that of underlying demand.As such crunches occur about every two years, semiconductor investors are swift to slash forecasts. Consensus earnings for the US chipmakers are expected to fall by about 25 per cent in 2009, compared with a 0.3 per cent drop for the S&P 500, excluding financials. The darkest hours for chipmakers have tended to be the best moment to buy their shares. That could come early next year, since inventory levels were not that high going into this downturn.So if the global recession ends before 2010, bombed out semi stocks are a great bargain. The problem will come if consumption takes longer to recover. This time round the credit crunch is hitting both distributors and buyers of electronics in the developing world, just as the strength of the dollar is making components more expensive. Until it becomes clear that demand has stabilised, chipmakers will continue to find their feet dangling in the blackness.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

179;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-12-09T22:16:27Z;Overview: Investors focus on weakening earnings outlook;;"Global equity markets diverged on Tuesday and risk aversion increased amid year-end worries, after investors were forced to focus on the weakening earnings outlook.Disappointing news from some high-profile companies dominated markets. Sony, the Japanese electronics group, said it was cutting 16,000 jobs and curbing investments; US logistics group FedEx slashed its 2009 outlook; and Texas Instruments, the US chipmaker, issued a profit warning.Year-end funding concerns were highlighted as $30bn four-week US Treasury bills were sold at a discounted rate of 0 per cent for the first time. Implied yields for three-month bills briefly traded at negative 0.1 per cent as investors continued to seek the safety of government debt and disregard returns before the end of the year.The effective Fed funds rate was quoted at 1/16th, or 0.0625 per cent, well below its target rate of 1 per cent, as strains in the financial system intensified.Wall Street’s losses were led by financials and overall sentiment was also depressed by weak earnings news. The S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent lower.Equity markets outside the US managed a resilient performance, which helped maintain the year-end bear market rally, which had been predicted by a growing number of analysts.“A lot of the bad news is already discounted in valuations,” said Robert Buckland, global equity strategist at Citigroup.“We expect equities to stabilise, but a sustainable rally is unlikely until an economic and earnings recovery becomes more visible.”European investors pushed equities higher for a second consecutive session. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 1.4 per cent led by oil groups, banks and carmakers, taking its gains for the past two days to 8.4 per cent.Performances in Asia were mixed. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.8 per cent, but Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.9 per cent after climbing by nearly 9 per cent on Monday.Singapore’s Straits Times index, which was closed on Monday, rose 5.8 per cent.Economic data showed no let up in global economic frailty. Although Germany’s ZEW survey of investor sentiment showed a slight pick-up, analysts were unimpressed and said much of it was down to falling oil prices, the weaker euro and interest rate cuts, rather than a fundamental change in sentiment.“The fact that the index remains deeply in negative territory shows that far more investors expect the German economy to deteriorate further over the next six months than think that conditions will improve,” said Jennifer McKeown, at Capital Economics.Retail sales in the UK were also weak. The British Retail Consortium reported that sales fell 2.6 per cent in November, after dropping 2.2 per cent in October.Manufacturing output fell 1.4 per cent in October – the eighth consecutive month of declines.Trading in currency markets was volatile and followed the fluctuating fortunes of equities and economic reports. The dollar briefly slipped below Y92 against the yen as Wall Street sank in afternoon trade.Sterling was hurt by the weak UK data and fell against its leading rivals.The Canadian dollar slipped more than 1 per cent against its US neighbour after the Bank of Canada surprised the market with a three-quarter point rate cut, leaving its overnight rate at 1.5 per cent.As investors favoured the dollar, commodities markets ended their brief rally. Oil prices slipped after the US Energy Information Administration reduced its demand outlook for 2008 and 2009. US crude fell $1.64 to settle at $42.07 a barrel.Government bonds were mixed. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund climbed 8 basis points to 3.23 per cent as European investors favoured equities over government paper. In the US, Treasury yields fell as losses for stocks deepened.The yield on the two-year note dropped 11bp to 0.84 per cent.Credit markets were mixed. The iTraxx Crossover index in Europe edged back to 1,001 while the CDX North American index edged wider to 265bp. A six week drought in US high yield issuance was broken when El Paso, the oil and gas producer sold $500m of five-year debt."
180;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-12-09T21:54:47Z;Financials suffer losses as Wall St rally fades;;Financial stocks bore the brunt of the losses on Wall Street on Tuesday as a two-day rally fizzled out.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs dropped 8.2 per cent to $14.97 and 5.7 per cent to $72.77, respectively, amid nervousness of more write-downs ahead of fourth quarter earnings.KBW said their figures are “expected to be grim”. The broker cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Morgan Stanley from a profit to a loss of $0.19 a share.Fresh signs of stress in credit markets – the Treasury sold $30bn in four-week bills at zero per cent as investors fled to safety – added to the selling pressure. JPMorganfell 6.9 per cent to $33.96. Bank of New York Mellon was among several regional banks to sustain heavy losses, down10.2 per cent to $27.63.Discount brokers were in focus after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the sector with a “neutral” view. “Client activity could retract significantly in 2009,” Goldman said. OptionsXpress lost 8.5 per cent to $12.82 after the bank gave a “sell” recommendation and a $13 price target. “We expect 2009 to be the first year since 2002 when industry option volumes decline.”Profit warnings and downgrades added to the gloom and pushed the S&P 500 index 2.3 per cent lower to 888.67 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.7 per cent to 8,691.33 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.6 per cent to 1,547.34.Investors took profits in infrastructure stocks, which had enjoyed strong gains on the back of economic stimulus plans from president-elect Barack Obama.FedEx was the worst hit in the industrial sector, off 14.5 per cent – its worst show since 1987 – to $63.65 after the package shipping group issued a profit warning.United Parcel Service, another delivery group, lost 7 per cent to $54.51 and was also pushed lower from a bearish JPMorgan note.“The deterioration in express demand trends appear to be so sharp that the market weakness will overwhelm the benefit from DHL’s withdrawal from the US and also the support for earnings from falling fuel prices,” the bank said, and cut its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.Transport stocks came under further pressure from Con-way, which dropped 13.9 per cent to $22.19 after the trucking group also slashed its earnings forecast.The financial sector led the retreat, down 4.9 per cent, amid concerns about more possible writedowns in the fourth quarter.Host Hotels was the biggest loser on the S&P, down 16.1 per cent to $7.15. The lodging sector came under pressure after Wachovia downgraded its recommendation on the sector to “underweight”.Still, there were rare signs of encouragement. The market entered positive territory during the morning and traders appeared encouraged by signs that some sectors had stopped reacting so adversely to bad news.Semiconductor stocks performed well in spite of a profit warning from Texas Instruments, which rose 4.9 per cent to $15.55.Investors also overlooked planned factory closures by Sony, the Japanese electronics group, and snapped up technology stocks on hopes they may have reached a nadir. The sector finished down 0.5 per cent.Better than feared results from Autozone lifted shares in the car parts retailer 6.9 per cent to $124.51.The energy sector had earlier provided the market with support but tracked the oil price lower to finish down.General Motors and Ford lost 4.7 per cent to $4.70 and 4.4 per cent to $3.23, respectively, amid fears political wrangling could delay a government bail-out of the ailing car industry.Food retailers came under pressure from Kroger, which warned fourth-quarter profit would be less than Wall Street had expected.Shares in the grocery chain lost 6.7 per cent to $25.47.Wal-Mart lost 3 per cent to $55.81 after the discounter agreed to pay $54.3m to settle a wage and hours-related lawsuit in Minnesota and suspended its share buy-back.Airlines were one of the worst performing sectors, off 7.2 per cent overall, after Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association, warned that the industry would suffer a $2.5bn net loss next year.
181;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-12-09T02:00:00Z;TI cuts forecast as sales slump;;Texas Instruments issued drastically reduced forecasts for its fourth quarter on Monday as the world's third largest chipmaker saw demand slide across all its product lines.TI said it was temporarily closing many of its factories to run down its inventories. With its manufacturing operation running at only about 45 per cent of capacity, the Dallas-based company said such levels had not been seen since the second half of 2001.TI chips are found in products from consumer electronics to cars – a broader range than other semiconductor makers, including the number one and two players, Intel and Samsung.Ron Slaymaker, TI vice-president, told an analyst conference call: “Wireless [mobile phone chips] is leading the decline …but all major product areas are weaker than …we expected back in October. Distributor resales are expected to be down about 20 per cent and our sales into that channel [will be down] significantly more than that.”On its third quarter earnings call seven weeks ago, TI predicted fourth-quarter sales of $2.83bn to $3.07bn and earnings per share of 30 to 36 cents.On Monday’s midquarter update, it broke from its normal practice of narrowing those ranges to predicting much lower levels of sales of $2.3bn to $2.5bn and earnings of 10 to 16 cents.Analysts had expected revenues of $2.89bn, according to Reuters Estimates.Mr Slaymaker said TI was trying to get ahead of the downturn by cutting costs. He announced the company had tightened capital spending, launched a voluntary retirement programme, instituted a hiring freeze and restricted travel.TI shares have lost more than half their value in the past six months. They fell 3.85 per cent to $14.25 in extended trading in New York.
182;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-30T18:22:13Z;Chipmaker warns of global sales decline;;The global semiconductor industry may face a sales decline of up to 10 per cent next year, the head of the world’s biggest contract chipmaker said yesterday.Rick Tsai, chief executive of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which commands half of the sector’s global market share, said foundries such as TSMC and United Microelectronics Corp were being hit as the industry faced the “unusually challenging environment” caused by the financial crisis.“We are now expecting the semiconductor industry [revenues] to decline by mid-to-high single digits in 2009,” Mr Tsai told an investor conference in Taipei.Semiconductor manufacturers round the world are reporting worsening results and reduced orders because of the looming prospect of a global recession. TSMC expects its revenue in the fourth quarter of this year to be about T$70bn ($2.1bn), a decline of about 25 per cent from the third quarter. UMC, its main rival, predicted a similar decline in fourth quarter sales on Wednesday.In spite of the gloomy outlook, Mr Tsai said the technology industry would be likely to fare better this time than during its last previous big downturn in the aftermath of the tech bubble in 2001, partly owing to advances in how inventory is managed.“We all feel the rage of the storm. However, it is different from 2001 …the magnitude is smaller,” he said.But he said that there was “still very little visibility up to now” on the industry’s outlook and that consumer demand would “play a much bigger role” in this crisis.The drop in sales is expected to be particularly steep in the coming months because many of the foundries’ customers now prefer using up their existing inventory rather than placing new orders in the face of uncertain business conditions.Foundries sell to chip design companies that do not have their own manufacturing capabilities, such as Nvidia, the graphics card maker, or to those who own plants but increasingly look to outsource production, such as Texas Instruments, which makes mobile phone chips.The hardest hit among the chipmakers so far are those who manufacture memory chips such as dynamic random access memory chips, used in personal computers, or flash memory chips, used in portable devices.That sector of the industry has already been struggling with prices falling to below production costs because of oversupply.In South Korea, Hynix Semiconductor reported its biggest quarterly loss in more than seven years. The world’s second largest memory chipmaker suffered a net loss of Won1,650bn ($1.3bn) in the third quarter, its fourth straight quarterly net loss. In the same period last year Hynix reported a net profit of Won168bn.“The problem lies in the demand side. We’re not sure when we will see a significant pick-up in demand,” said Kwon Oh-chul, Hynix’s senior vice-president of strategic planning.
183;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-22T20:44:49Z;Wall St plunges on grim corporate outlook;;A fresh batch of grim earnings pushed US stocks to a new five-year low as concerns grew over the difficulties facing corporate America in the wake of banking sector turmoil.Company results – and, more importantly, their gloomy outlooks – across a wide range of sectors reinforced fears of a global, as well as domestic, recession. Energy and materials, down 10.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively, led the market slump.Down as much as 8.3 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 closed 6.1 per cent lower at 896.78, below the level reached earlier in the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7 per cent to 8,519.21 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 4.8 per cent to 1,615.75.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – shot up 30.5 per cent to 69.32, which indicated signs of heightened stress. Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said that traders had donned “tin helmets” as options for the index expired.AT&T and Boeing slid 7.6 per cent to $23.78 and 7.5 per cent to $42.91, respectively, after both were among several blue chip stocks to disclose worse-than-expected quarterly figures.Pharmaceuticals were hit after Merck also disclosed glum figures and downgraded its outlook. The Dow Component fell 6.5 per cent to $28.01 even after it unveiled plans to axe 12 per cent of its workforce, a move investors would normally welcome.Traditionally defensive stocks such as McDonald’s failed to escape the declines. Shares in the world’s largest restaurant group, which managed an increase in third-quarter profit, held on to gains for much of the day but closed down 1.7 per cent to $54.18. The consumer staples sector slid the least of all, but still finished 3.8 per cent lower.Energy was the biggest drag on the market, hurt by oil’s slide below $70 as well as negative earnings, and slumped 10.4 per cent overall. ConocoPhillips lost 9.1 per cent to $49.06 after the group disappointed with exploration and production forecasts as well as a reluctance to buy back its shares.Baker Hughes, down 22.1 per cent to $30.35, was one of the biggest drags on the S&P after the oilfield services group warned of a “less certain” outlook as energy prices continue to fall.“Markets are being dominated by the fears and nerves that have been dominating for the last few weeks,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets. “Growth is the main fear as earnings season gets into full swing.”Materials were another big laggard, down 8.3 per cent overall, hurt by BHP Billiton’s production figures.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, whose disappointing figures helped push the market sharply lower in the previous session, tumbled another 17.8 per cent to $26.92.All 10 main economic sectors were firmly in the red, although some technology groups managed to find positive territory.Apple added 5.9 per cent to $96.87, after sales of the iPhone powered a surge in quarterly profit. Yahoo advanced 2.7 per cent to $12.39 on plans to cut at least 10 per cent of its staff after quarterly profit fell sharply.Broadcom jumped 6.5 per cent to $14.70 on the back of better-than-expected results from the mobile phone chipmaker. Texas Instruments, under pressure in the previous session, recovered as much as 2.6 per cent but closed down 3.4 per cent at $16.28.SanDisk sank 31.6 per cent to $10.09 after Samsung Electronics dropped its $5.9bn unsolicited bid for the memory card manufacturer.Amazon fell 0.5 per cent to $49.99, having lost as much as 4.6 per cent on concerns that results due after the bell would echo a glum update from Ebay.Financials held up relatively well for much of the session as money market rates for interbank lending eased further, but sold off sharply towards the close, down 7 per cent. Insurers sustained particularly heavy losses.Still, Wells Fargo lost 4.1 per cent to $31.30 after Wachovia posted a $23.9bn third-quarter loss, the biggest of any US lender during the credit crisis. Shares in the bank, being acquired by Wells Fargo, fell 6.2 per cent to $5.71.
184;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-22T09:27:11Z;Asian shares follow Wall Street lower;;Asia-Pacific stocks resumed their declines on Wednesday, led by Japanese shares, as fears of a looming global recession troubled investors amid slowing earnings.The FTSE All-World Asia Pacific Index was trading down 5.5 per cent at 164.41.Asian companies joined the pool of disappointing earnings that had come out of the US overnight, adding to the gloom and highlighting the impact that the financial crisis was beginning to have on the wider economy.The Nikkei 225 slid 6.8 per cent to 8,674.69, while the broader Topix dropped 7.1 per cent to 900.59. The yen strengthened against the dollar during equity trading hours, breaking the Y100 barrier and adding to woes of exporters already coping with slowing markets.“I’m becoming immune,” said one trader. “When the market is down a couple per cent it feels like an up day these days. Minus three is the new zero.”Canon dropped 6.1 per cent to Y3,250 and Sony lost 9.3 per cent to Y2,495. Nissan fell 8.9 per cent to Y500.NEC Electronics, a listed arm of NEC that makes a diverse range of semiconductors, slumped 19.9 per cent to Y1,210 following a 90 per cent cut in its operating profit forecast and its pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year.Mitsubishi UFJ Holdings dropped 8.8 per cent to Y774 following a local report that it had decided to revise down its profit forecast due to bad loan costs and a drop in the value of shareholdings. The bank said in a statement that no decision had been made regarding an earnings revision.The report also said that Japan’s other two large banks, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial were also mulling reducing their earnings estimates for the first six months of the fiscal year. Mizuho shares fell 8.5 per cent to Y334,000 and Sumitomo Mitsui’s shares lost 8 per cent to Y505,000.The outlook for the steel industry in the region also looked bleak amid reports that Korean steelmaker Posco was planning on increasing its output cut of stainless steel to 30 per cent. Shares in the company dropped 7.8 per cent to Won296,000.The situation didn’t look much better in Japan as investors sold steel stocks amid concerns about production cuts.Nippon Steel dropped 7.9 per cent to Y313 while JFE Holdings dropped 10.1 per cent to Y2,235.In other markets across the region, The Hang Seng dropped 4.9 per cent to 14,305.09, weighed down once more by Citic Pacific’s share pummelling. The sub index of mainland Chinese shares trading in Hong Kong fell 7.1 per cent to 6,753.51.Citic Pacific crumbled a further 24.9 per cent to HK$4.92, after it said it potentially faced $2bn in losses from unauthorised forex bets. A report said lawmakers were urging the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to investigate whether the company could have disclosed the potential losses much earlier.Australian stocks lost 3.4 per cent to 4,156.1. Rio Tinto bucked the downward trend with a 5.4 per cent gain to A$78.40 amid a number of rumours concerning BHP Billiton’s hostile bid for the miner.BHP Billiton meanwhile, slid 7 per cent to A$27.25, falling alongside other commodity stocks across the region as oil prices fell below $70 per barrel. In Japan, Mitsubishi Corp. lost 8.9 per cent to Y1,684 and in Hong Kong, Cnooc dropped 9 per cent to HK$5.64 and PetroChina fell 8.7 per cent to HK$5.89.The Shanghai Composite index’s 3.2 per cent decline to 1,895.822 was relatively mild compared with the other major markets in the region. In South Korea, the Kospi fell 5.1 per cent to 1,134.59. Samsung lost 2.1 per cent to Won508,000 after it withdrew its bid for SanDisk.In Mumbai, the Sensex was down 2.7 per cent at 10,395.48.Taiwanese shares closed down 1.6 per cent at 4,862.59, the lowest since June 2003. Hon Hai lost 3.5 per cent to T$81.10. Singapore also dropped to a fresh four-year low. Singapore Petroleum shares shed 16.3 per cent to S$2.52 following its announcement that third quarter net profit slumped 99.5 per cent.In Indonesia, shares were down 4.7 per cent at 1,373.593.
185;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-22T00:40:39Z;Chipmakers feel the pinch as demand plunges;;Semiconductor companies across Asia are slashing their output, investment and profit forecasts because of a slump in demand, in the latest sign that the financial crisis is hitting the real economy.Japan’s Sumco, the world’s second-largest producer of the silicon wafers from which all microchips are made, on Tuesday said demand suddenly collapsed in September and it now expected to earn 45 per cent less this year than was forecast only seven weeks ago.“The impact from the financial markets has been uncertainty, falling profits for our customers, cutbacks in capital investment and lower rates of capacity utilisation,” Sumco said.Evidence that the crisis has caused demand to fall in a sector with few direct links to the financial markets will raise fears of a deep recession in the real economy. It suggests that many electronics manufacturers are preparing for a bad Christmas selling season.The situation is mirrored in the US where memory chipmakers are suffering and the wider economic problems are beginning to have an impact on the industry generally.Micron said this month it was cutting 15 per cent of its workforce and would slash production of Nand flash memory, which is used in devices such as MP3 players. It said oversupply and declining customer demand had driven selling prices “significantly below manufacturing costs”.Texas Instruments, a more broadly based chipmaker, said on Monday revenues were weak in its third quarter “because consumers and corporations reduced their spending in this uncertain economy”.It is cutting expenses by a third – more than $200m – in its wireless business and selling off part of the operation.NEC Electronics, a separately listed arm of NEC that makes a diverse range of semiconductors, on Tuesday cut its 2009 operating profit forecast by 90 per cent to only Y1bn ($9.9m). “The outlook for the second half of the fiscal year appears grim,” the company said.Meanwhile, Powerchip of Taiwan, which together with its Japanese technology partner Elpida is the world’s third-biggest maker of D-Ram memory chips, said it would drastically cut capital expenditure next year.Sumco, which sells to almost every kind of chipmaker, said not only were orders being cancelled and reduced, but selling prices were also falling as its customers undertook a “radical” inventory adjustment. It now forecasts a full-year profit of Y32bn for the year to February 2009 – which implies profits in the second half of only Y6.4bn.“I judge these conditions will continue for at least a year,” said Kenjiro Shigematsu, Sumco’s president.Sumco said it would cut capital investment, dismiss temporary workers and not increase output as planned, showing the impact of a technology slowdown on the wider economy in Japan.Makers of memory chips such as D-Ram for computers and Nand flash for mobile phones were already suffering from overcapacity and falling prices but Sumco’s warning suggests the financial crisis has made it worse. Brian Shieh, Powerchip’s president, said on Tuesday the industry was still “in the ice age …I don’t have the answer for when spring will come.”The warning by NEC Electronics, meanwhile, is a sign that problems are spreading to a wider range of chips. The company said sales of semiconductors used in cars were expected to face much harsher market conditions.Paul O’Donovan, principal analyst in the semiconductor group at Gartner, said there was little visibility on chip sales for the rest of 2008 and the start of 2009, but he expected slow growth rather than outright decline in most areas of the business.“Everyone’s going to be holding their breath, because it’s going to be painful over the next two or three years,” he said.
186;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession. The sector overall stood 4.3 per cent lower.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s cut the expected 2008 dividend payment for the S&P 500 from $28.85 to $28.05, the lowest growth rate since 2001.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s ”fear gauge”, rose 1.1 per cent. At 53.253, it continued to indicate heightened distress.The fresh market decline came as it emerged that investor confidence plummeted last month, according to State Street research.
187;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-21T18:25:51Z;Overview: Spectre of recession haunts investors;;Recession fears returned to haunt financial markets on Tuesday, undermining a recent improvement in investor risk appetite and overshadowing a further decline in interbank lending rates.News that the Chicago Fed’s national activity index had fallen to its lowest level since 1982, along with negative profit outlooks from companies such as Texas Instruments and DuPont, weighed on US and European equities and sent investors fleeing to the relative safety of government bonds.Commodity prices also staged a broad retreat on worries about falling demand, and were further hurt by fresh gains for the dollar as hedge funds continued to liquidate risky positionsJohn Higgins at Capital Economics said the lacklustre performance of the US equity market indicated that investor concerns had shifted from a meltdown in the financial sector to the rapid deterioration in the real economy.“The worrying news is that once recessions begin in earnest, conditions typically deteriorate very rapidly as confidence, activity, employment and incomes all plummet in unison,” he said.“We now expect US GDP to contract by 1 per cent annualised in the third quarter, dragged down by a severe slump in consumer spending.”On the other side of the Atlantic, the latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry made for grim reading. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, described the survey as “simply terrible” and said it would fuel fears that the UK could be in for a prolonged and deep recession.“The sharp manufacturing downturn and substantially reduced price pressures evident in the CBI survey heighten the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates aggressively again in November,” he said.European Central Bank officials warned on Tuesday that eurozone growth next year would at best stagnate following the financial crisis.However, Marco Annunziata, economist at UniCredit, said a global recession was far from a foregone conclusion.“The risk of a full-fledged credit crunch has receded, and emerging markets are slowing but not grinding to a halt,” he said. “The biggest threat now probably comes from the ongoing deleveraging that is already putting downward pressure on asset prices.”There was further encouraging news from the money markets as the three-month dollar Libor rate fixed at its lowest level for a month and the overnight rate slipped below the Fed’s target funds rate of 1.5 per cent.Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon, said low volumes in both equity and money markets continued to signal caution among investors with regard to counterparty and transaction risk.Equity markets in Europe and the US relinquished some of the previous session’s strong gains. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.5 per cent, despite gains for French banks after the government’s €10.5bn capital injection into the sector.The FTSE 100 in London shed 1.2 per cent and by midday on Tuesday in New York, the S&P 500 was 1.9 per cent lower.But Asia enjoyed a broadly positive session as export stocks took heart from hopes for another fiscal stimulus package in the US. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo jumped 3.3 per cent.Government bonds gained ground as equities retreated. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was down 13 basis points at 3.73 per cent while the 10-year Bund yield 3bp lower at 3.92 per cent.In the currency markets, the dollar touched its highest level against the euro since March 2007, although it eased back against the yen as risk aversion intensified. The US currency also hit a three-year high against the Canadian dollar even as the Bank of Canada cut interest rates by a smaller than expected 25 basis points.Emerging market currencies came under renewed pressure, with the Turkish lira, Brazilian real and South African rand all sliding more than 4 per cent against the dollar.In commodities, the benchmark US oil price fell more than $4 a barrel. This was in spite of continued expectations that Opec would announce a supply cut at its emergency meeting later this week.Base metals fell across the board and gold shed 2.8 per cent.
188;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-21T16:53:31Z;European markets weaken on consumer slowdown;;European shares slipped lower amid weak sentiment yesterday, as the French government decision to inject €10.5bn into its banking system lifted financials, but failed to offset the impact of poor earnings in other sectors.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ticked 0.5 per cent lower to 923.93, having climbed as high as 944.2 in early trade. In Germany the Xetra Dax fell 1.1 per cent to 4,784.41, but the CAC 40 index in Paris held onto gains, up 0.8 per cent at 3,475.4, bolstered by government moves to improve bank liquidity.On Monday night France’s finance minister announced that six banks would receive loans from the government as part of the €40bn recapitalisation fund unveiled last week.Jean-Pierre Lambert at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said: “The goal is to support lending - banks are committed to increasing their loans to companies and households by 3 to 4 per cent. The banks have been chosen as a function of their key role in the financing of the French economy.”Crédit Agricole, which will receive €3bn under the scheme, jumped 15.7 per cent to €12.10. BNP Paribas, due to receive €2.55bn, rose 7.5 per cent to €59, and Société Générale, assigned €1.7bn, leapt 10.2 per cent to €48.43.But other sectors dragged the markets lower amid growing evidence of a global consumer slowdown. Technology stocks suffered after America’s second largest chip-maker, Texas Instruments, posted disappointing third quarter results and warned of a further decline in its fourth quarter revenue.Rich Templeton, TI Chairman, said: “Revenue was weak because consumers and corporations reduced their spending in this uncertain economy.”Amid falling confidence, leading telecom equipment maker Ericsson tumbled 8.1 per cent to SKr53.70, while ST Microelectronics, Europe’s largest chipmaker, shed 3.2 per cent to €6.39.In France, Alcatel-Lucent touched a high of €2.12 after announcing a deal to build a commercial wireless broadband network in Armenia, before reversing its gains to fall 1 per cent to €2.01.Aeroports De Paris, the owner of Charles de Gaulle, and Orly airports, surged 4.5 per cent to €49.17, on news of an alliance with the Dutch state-owned Schipol Group. The deal, which will see the two airport operators acquiring an 8% stake in each other’s share capital, is expected to generate around €71m in combined revenue and cost savings by 2013. Dexia raised its recommendation for Aeroports De Paris stock to “buy” from “neutral”.Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and metals producer, plunged 12.3 per cent to NKr27 after reporting worse than expected third quarter profits. CEO Eivind Reiten said results had been hit by “the global financial crisis and uncertainty in world commodity markets”. The company forecast a further weakening over 2008 due to slowing demand in Europe for metal products, particularly from the automotive and building markets which have been punished by turmoil in the credit markets.Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche dived 5.6 per cent to SFr170.30, following a decline in nine month sales of its antiviral drug Tamiflu, but confirmed plans for a takeover of Genentech, the US biotech group. Competitor Novartis weakened 0.6 per cent to SFr59.The heaviest loser on the index was Volkswagen, in its third straight session of losses, as it eased back from last week’s record high of €398.84. The German carmaker, Europe’s largest, retreated 12.4 per cent to €242.75, though shares were still 18 per cent higher than at the start of September.In Moscow the benchmark Micex index gained 4.2 per cent to 652.51, on the first day Russia’s sovereign wealth fund was allowed to buy domestic stocks. Russian shares have lost two thirds in value since their peak in May this year.
189;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Sun Micro: Making a bad habit of restructuring and impairment charges;;"Things certainly aren’t getting any better over at Sun Microsystems. Wall Street had been expecting revenues to decline 2-3 per cent in the latest quarter. Instead, Sun just pre-announced figures that suggest revenues are down roughly 7 per cent from a year ago. No IBM silver lining there.The red ink is also starting to flow again: a pro-forma net loss of 2-12 cents for the quarter, according to Sun, which will release the full gory details on October 30th.It is surely high time to look beyond this pro-forma picture. Sun says its figures were struck before “amortization of acquisition related intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related impairment of long-lived assets, … net gain or loss on equity investments and the tax effect of these” – a lengthening list that doesn’t inspire confidence. The latest expected impairment, announced today, stems from a review of $1.8bn of goodwill associated with some of its acquisitions, notably the $4bn StorageTek deal three years ago.It’s getting hard to simply ignore some of these costs. The latest annual report talks of “Restructuring Plan VIII,” begun in May of this year. This is starting to sound like a bad habit.Sun has taken big restructuring charges every year for the last seven years (the $97m charge in 2007 was the only year it fell below $100m.) That must be some sort of record. The running total is now well over $2bn. And the latest news suggests that Sun is going to hurt much more than better-positioned rivals as the economy heads down.Chris Nuttall adds: Texas Instruments said today revenues were weak in its third quarter “because consumers and corporations reduced their spending in this uncertain economy.”
Rich Templeton, chief executive of the second biggest US chipmaker, said: “Our outlook for the fourth quarter is for revenue to decline substantially based on weak order trends over the past few months.”TI said was cutting expenses by one-third, or more than $200m a year, in its wireless business and planned to sell a portion of the operation. Third-quarter sales of $3.39bn were 8 per cent less than a year ago and earnings per share fell 17 per cent to 43 cents."
190;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.
191;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-10-02T22:06:18Z;Freescale lacks scale, plans retreat from mobile chips;;Nearly four years after its spin-off by Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor could be spinning off itself the cell phone chip business that represented its best-known ties to the mother ship.Freescale became the subject of the biggest tech buyout in history two years ago, when private equity firms Blackstone Group, Carlyle, Permira and TPG paid $17.6bn for the Texas-based company.They brought in a new chief executive in March – Rich Beyer from Silicon Valley chipmaker Intersil – and he has taken a fresh look at the business.“Scale is important in this [cellular] business, particularly as we are seeing consolidation, and Freescale simply doesn’t have the scale to grow back to be one of the true market leaders,” Mr Beyer told me this morning.The consolidation he refers to is among handset makers, where the top five have more than 80 per cent of the market and Motorola’s market share has more than halved to less than 10 per cent.They are demanding more complex chipsets and accompanying application software – an area where Qualcomm has become a master, but smaller chipmakers cannot make the level of investment to be competitive.Motorola has been buying more chips from Qualcomm, hitting Freescale’s market share further and reducing its revenues from Motorola to below 25 per cent of its total chip sales.Freescale fell from fourth to eighth position in the worldwide top ten of wireless chip suppliers in 2007, according to the iSuppli research firm.It had 3.6 per cent of the market by sales, compared to 16.7 per cent for Texas Instruments and 19.1 per cent for Qualcomm, the market leader.In an announcement, Freescale said it was exploring strategic options for its cellular business and intended to complete a sale, joint venture agreement “or other transformation in the coming months.”Mr Beyer said bankers had been appointed and he expected an outcome in the next 90 days. He did not name any possible partners but STMicroelectronics, Infineon, NXP, MediaTek and Broadcom are other leading wireless chip providers.Freescale will be focusing on its market leading businesses in networking and the automotive industry in future, in a strategy that Mr Beyer said his private-equity board members were fully behind.With some major debt financing behind Freescale’s acquisition, I had to ask if the company was suffering any liquidity problems in the current financial crisis.“At the end of Q2, we had about $1.3bn in cash, our debt service is in the $700m [a year] range, we are generating significant cash…so the company’s in very healthy shape from a liquidity standpoint,” he said.
192;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-09-12T16:57:43Z;The chip that changed the world;;The 50th anniversary of the integrated circuit is being celebrated today with Texas Instruments announcing Kilby Labs, a centre that will focus on further semiconductor breakthroughs.TI new employee Jack Kilby demonstrated the first IC to management on September 12 1958, after spending his first summer there developing a circuit on a single chip made of germanium.Robert Noyce, Intel’s co-founder, is credited as a co-inventor in coming up with the same idea shortly afterwards at Fairchild Semiconductor, except basing it on a silicon chip.Noyce died in 1990 and Kilby in 2005.TI said Kilby Labs would be based in Dallas and bring together university researchers and TI engineers to develop new chip advances. It has also recreated Kilby’s original lab at its headquarters as “a visual reminder of the power of science and technology.”Jim Tully, Gartner analyst, said in a note:“The integrated circuit is the engine of the information age. It has been a catalyst for the democratisation of knowledge and changing global social structures. It facilitates mass communication through mobile phones and large-scale access to information and entertainment through the Internet.”According to Gartner, sales of ICs have been growing at about 10 per cent annually for the past several decades and around $270bn worth of ICs will be sold globally in 2008.Not a bad outcome for a one-man summer project.
193;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-09-10T20:52:23Z;Rally in energy and tech stocks lift Wall Street;;Washington Mutual slid to its lowest level since 1991 on Wednesday as the wider financial sector took scant comfort from Lehman Brothers’ hurried update and failed to recover from the previous session’s heavy losses.The mortgage lender, which has been placed under special regulatory supervision, fell a further 29.7 per cent to $2.32 as the cost of insuring against the risk of its default rose markedly. Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on the lender from “stable” to “negative”.Also in focus was American International Group, which fell a further 4.7 per cent to 17.50 after the world’s largest insurer suffered a fall of 19.3 per cent in the previous session on the back of mounting uncertainty over Lehman Brother’s ability to raise capital.Citigroup, which cut its profit forecasts, nevertheless wrote in a note to clients: “Not similar to Lehman – we believe that AIG has plenty of less drastic options in its arsenal …before the impact of a controlling partner is even under consideration.”Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch lost 3.7 per cent to 38.92 and 5.9 per cent to $23.30, respectively.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a sector note: “The bank operating environment remains challenging, amid slowing economic growth, contraction of credit and constrained capital.”E-Trade Financial fell 4.4 per cent $3.03 after it said three-year cumulative losses on its home equity loans would be greater than expected.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which disclosed its third-quarter earnings a week early to reassure investors, edged down 1.8 per cent to $7.95, after a 45 per cent fall in Tuesday’s session.On Tuesday, the financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to strengthen its balance sheet prompted wider concerns over asset sales ahead of banks’ third quarter earnings season.However, a rally in energy and technology stocks helped lift the major indices into positive territory on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,232.04 by the close in New York while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 11,268.92 and the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent to 2,228.70.Outside financials, the mood was upbeat. In particular, an update from Fedex helped sentiment.The cargo group said first-quarter profit would exceed its forecasts on the back of lower fuel costs and its shares rose 3.7 per cent to $87.86.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rose 0.6 per cent to $21.85 on the back of a positive update from the chipmaker that eased concerns over reduced mobile phone demand.Orders this quarter matched its expectations and the company did not cut forecasts. S&P raised its price target from $96 to $105.That gave a boost to technology stocks, which have been hard hit in recent sessions on fears of global growth slowdown.The sector boasted gains of 0.7 per cent while shares of technology bellwether IBM rose 2.61 per cent to $118.04.Research in Motion rose 5.4 per cent to $104.61 after unveiling plans to launch a new “flip” version of its BlackBerry Pearl phone.Yahoo edged up 0.7 per cent at $17.70 even after Sanford C Bernstein cut its price target from $26 to $24.But Google lost 1.1 per cent to $414.16 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from $620 to $600.Meanwhile, energy stocks rallied following Opec’s decision to lower oil production.Among the top gainers were ExxonMobil, up 2.7 per cent at $75.25, Massey Energy, up 8.2 per cent at $42.10 and Hess, which which stood 7.5 per cent higher at $85.67.US Steel advanced 4.5 per cent to $35.23 after reaching an agreement with the United Steelworkers union.In other news, interdealer broker GFI Group fell 24.5 per cent to $7.26 after merger talks with Tullett Prebon of the UK fell apart as the two were unable to reach acceptable terms.Elsewhere, software maker Salesforce.com and Fastenal rose after the duo were picked to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the S&P 500. Their shares rose 7.7 per cent to $56.09 and 0.8 per cent to $52.58, respectively.
194;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-09-05T14:04:21Z;Nokia stuns market with strong warning;;Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, warned on Friday that its market share would shrink in the third quarter of the year, ending a period of almost uninterrupted growth and wiping almost 10 per cent off its share price.The Finnish company stood by its earlier forecast that industry-wide unit sales for the full year would increase but admitted for the first time that aggressive moves by its competitors were pricing it out of the market.The warning shocked investors, who had come to believe that the industry juggernaut was immune to the global economic downturn.Shares in Nokia closed down 9.6 per cent at €14.20 on Friday, its lowest level in almost three years.The news also hit shares of Nokia’s leading suppliers. STMicroelectronics was down 5.5 per cent to €8.15 while Qualcomm shares were off about 0.8 per cent on the Nasdaq and Texas Instruments was down 1.8 per cent on NYSE.Rick Simonson, Nokia’s chief financial officer, declined to predict how much the company’s market share would drop but said: “We are not talking about several points here”. The company sold four out of every 10 mobile phones globally at the end of the second quarter.Mr Simonson told analysts that that profitability would be affected: “Less units equals lower revenues equals lower operating profit,” he said.Nokia is not the first large mobile maker to report problems this year. Sony Ericsson, the world’s fifth-largest mobile manufacturer, has issued two profit warnings because fewer consumers are buying handsets than previously expected in its core European markets because of the economic downturn.Nokia stressed that the decline in its market share was due to a decision not to participate in a price war for low-end phone sales being waged by competitors such as Samsung of South Korea.“Nokia’s strategy is to take market share only when the company believes it to be sustainably profitable in the longer term. Nokia has not broadly participated in recent aggressive pricing activity as it believes that the negative impact to profitability would outweigh any short-term incremental benefits to device unit sales,” the group stated.In spite of this commitment to profitability, the announcement has made clear for the first time that Nokia is not impervious to competitive pressures and the giant Finnish company can be undermined.It raises doubts about the sustainability of Nokia’s business model of building market share, especially in large emerging markets, and increasing its profitability while being able to reduce the prices of its handsets.Mr Simonson insisted that the prices being offered by its competitors were “not sustainable” and he was confident that there would be a recovery in the fourth quarter.The company continued to expect an increase in its market share in mobile devices for the full year 2008.However, it cautioned that this global market would be “impacted by weaker consumer confidence in multiple markets”, although industry mobile device volumes in 2008 should grow 10 per cent or more from the approximately 1.14bn units Nokia estimated for 2007.When it released its second-quarter results in July, the company reported a 13 per cent year-on-year rise in earnings per share and increased its sales forecasts at the time. Net sales for the second quarter rose 4 per cent to €13.2bn ($20.9bn) while its operating margin rose from 11.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 to 14.7 per cent, even though the average price of its handsets fell to €74 from €79.The results had added weight to Nokia’s long-stated claim that its scale and geographical scope allows it to increase market share, margins and earnings while average selling prices drop.
195;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-08-20T09:24:51Z;Ericsson and STMicro to join forces;;Ericsson and STMicroelectronics are creating a joint venture to supply semiconductors to mobile phone manufacturers in an effort to compete with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, the biggest mobile chipmakers.The as yet unnamed venture, which will also supply other handset components, will have annual sales of $3.6bn. Sweden’s Ericsson, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone networks, will inject $1.1bn into the joint venture, $700m of which will be paid to STMicroelectronics.Geneva-based STMicroelectronics, the fifth-largest semiconductor maker, is contributing its ST-NXP Wireless mobile phone semiconductor business that was formed by another joint venture only 19 days ago. Ericsson will put its mobile platform business into the venture.The deal underlines how the need for economies of scale continues to fuel consolidation in the telecoms industry. The growth of the mobile internet, which requires more capable handsets, is also pushing companies to pool their capital and research and development resources.Carl-Henric Svanberg, Ericsson’s chief executive, said the rationale behind the joint venture was based on the complementary nature of STMicroelectronics and Ericsson’s businesses rather than any cost savings. “There has been an increase in complexity in this business. We will provide a complete solution customers have been asking for.”Mr Svanberg said that the venture would compete with Texas Instruments and Qualcomm as one of the top three mobile semiconductor ­makers.Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, has also recently stated its intention to move into the mobile semiconductor market. Mr Svanberg acknowledged Intel’s intentions, adding that computers and mobile were “coming to a meeting point”. The joint venture already has relationships with four of the top five handset makers: Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG.ST-NXP Wireless was formed on August 2 out of the wireless semiconductor operations of ST Microelectronics and NXP, a European rival.Carlo Bozotti, STMicro-electronics chief executive, said the joint venture with NXP had been designed to strengthen its wireless operations, and described the two successive joint ventures as a “quantum leap”.Analysts sounded a cautious note, suggesting that Ericsson’s mobile platform had not lived up to its potential and was questionable as a standalone business.Martin Nilsson, analyst at Carnegie in Stockholm said: “This is a defensive play by Ericsson to ensure they have a business model they can continue to run.”The new joint venture will have almost 8,000 employees, with about 5,000 coming from STMicroelectronics and 3,000 from Ericsson. It will have headquarters in Geneva and be divided into two companies. The first will focus on research and marketing with its revenues consolidated by STMicroelectronics.Ericsson will consolidate the revenues of the other company, which will provide platform designs.Shares of STMicroelectronics gained 2.9 per cent to $12.24 while Ericsson was up 0.5 per cent at SKr65.80.
196;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-07-24T19:44:02Z;Qualcomm hails Nokia settlement;;Qualcomm on Thursday hailed a new technology cross-licensing agreement with Nokia as a major boost for the wireless industry.The 15-year deal put an end to extensive litigation between the world’s leading wireless chip producer and the largest handset maker, opening up use of each other’s patents in 2G, 3G and future 4G technologies.Qualcomm’s shares opened 20 per cent higher at $53.82 on news of the settlement.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call the dispute had “overshadowed the performance of the company”.As part of the deal, Nokia is withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission about Qualcomm’s licensing practices. It also includes an undisclosed upfront payment to ­Qualcomm and ongoing ­royalties.Rick Simonson, Nokia’s chief financial officer, said: “We can lay down our legal arms. Litigation is not our core business. This 15-year deal – which in our industry is a long time – takes away all the noise, and covers all the relevant technologies.”San Diego-based Qualcomm overtook Texas Instruments last year as the number one wireless chipmaker, but makes most of its profits from licensing its extensive patent portfolio.The European Commission launched an investigation of Qualcomm’s dominance of 3G standards last year, following a 2005 complaint by TI, Broadcom, Ericsson, NEC, Nokia and Panasonic.They said that Qualcomm was failing to license its patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.An Ericsson spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday that nothing had changed and the Commission investigation should continue. The Korean Fair Trade Commission has launched a similar inquiry.Qualcomm raised its ­outlook for its fiscal year, now in its fourth quarter, and said the Nokia deal could improve its profits by seven to 13 cents a share.It reported third quarter revenues grew 19 per cent year-on-year to $2.8bn, but profits fell 4 per cent to 45 cents a share as research and general costs, including legal expenses, grew.
197;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Intel enters embedded chips market;;Intel has launched an assault on the market for embedded chips, setting its sights on selling relatively high-end processors that will power new kinds of devices.The world’s biggest chipmaker is searching for new growth outside its core PC business and believes the embedded market is a $10bn opportunity.Intel announced on Thursday its first eight products in the category and said it already had 50 customers.Embedded chips are a specialty of rivals such as Texas Instruments and can rely on designs from companies such as ARM and MIPS, which feature reduced instruction set (Risc) processors.They can be simple and low cost, finding uses in production lines, petrol stations and cash registers.Intel has been shrinking its own designs – the PC’s x86 architecture – to compete and is touting its platform’s sophisticated features such as internet connectivity, high-quality graphics and support of full-featured operating systems.“We’re now able to deliver more highly integrated products ranging from industrial robotics and in-car infotainment systems to set-top boxes, [Mobile Internet Devices] and other devices,” said Gadi Singer, general manager of Intel ’s SoC (system-on-a-chip) Enabling group.“By designing more complex systems onto smaller chips, Intel will scale the performance, functionality and software compatibility of Intel Architecture while controlling the overall power, cost and size requirements.”Intel will use the core of its low-power Atom microprocessor, launched this year, in most of the 15 SoC designs it has planned. Its initial products will cost between $40 and $95.“Intel has advanced technologies and processes and to support that they need high profits and margins,” said Martin Reynolds, analyst with the Gartner research firm. “The problem is that in the traditional SoC market, the margins are relatively thin, it wouldn’t fund that kind of business.“They need to find places where they are not competing with the low-cost stuff and that means raising the game in what these devices can do,” he said.
198;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
199;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-07-22T10:50:12Z;Battered carmakers lead Japanese rally;;Japanese blue chips enjoyed their biggest one-day rise for eight weeks on Tuesday as the market reopened after a public holiday and caught up with the strong gains across the region on Monday.The Nikkei 225 Average rose 3 per cent to 13,184.96 and the broader Topix index ended 2.8 per cent higher at 1,287.74. Buying accelerated after a technical problem that had forced the suspension of trading in derivatives contracts was resolved.Carmakers led the rally as bargain-hunters targeted the battered sector. Toyota Motor rose 5.6 per cent to Y4,910 and Honda jumped 5.3 per cent to Y3,600.A rally for crude oil prices helped trading house Itochu climb 8.6 per cent to Y1,075 and larger rival Mitsui & Co gain 6.6 per cent to Y2,170.Shin-Etsu Chemical gained 5.2 per cent to Y6,640 after it unveiled a 13 per cent rise in quarterly profits.Karachi also put in a strong performance as state-run institutions bought heavily amid expectations of further government measures to support the market. After the close of trade it was announced that a government-backed stabilisation fund would begin investing this week.The KSE-100 index jumped 4 per cent to 10,784.41, although it remains 31 per cent down from a record high in April. Turnover in equities reached 98.7m shares, up from 74m on Monday.Mumbai pushed ahead for a fourth session amid optimism that India’s coalition government would win a crucial confidence vote in parliament. The BSE Sensex rose 1.8 per cent to 14,104.20, its highest close for nearly a month.Victory for the government would help clinch a civilian nuclear deal with the US, which helped power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals to gain 6 per cent to Rs1,597.50 and engineer Larsen & Toubroto rise 2.3 per cent to Rs2,571.75.Markets elsewhere in the region were little changed. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng index slipped 0.1 per cent to 22,551.13.HSBC gave back an early rise to end almost unchanged at HK$124.90 after it played down reports that a Chinese sovereign wealth fund was interested in buying a stake.Computer maker Lenovo fell 5.7 per cent to HK$5.26 after IBM, from which Lenovo bought the personal computer business, said it had sold its third tranche of shares in the Chinese company this year.Semiconductor Manufacturing International, on the other hand, jumped 11 per cent to HK$0.45 on reports that Datang Telecom was interested in buying a stake in the chipmaker.Shanghai’s Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,846.12 as heavyweights China Life Insurance and Sinopec ran into profit-taking. The former fell 2.2 per cent to Rmb26.33 and the latter 2.1 per cent to Rmb11.01, dragging the benchmark down 0.5 per cent to 2,846.12.Australian shares dropped slightly as the financial sector’s losses overwhelmed gains in miners and energy companies. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 5,005.60 after dropping as much as 1.3 per cent in early trading.ANZ Bank sank 3.9 per cent to A$18.07 and National Australia Bank dropped 2.4 per cent to A$27.65 following negative broker comment on both stocks.Seoul and Taipei were undermined by losses for technology stocks after disappointing results for several of their US peers. The Kospi slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,561.22 while the Taiwan weighted index shed 0.3 per cent to 7,065.65.In Singapore the Straits Times index lost 1 per cent to 2,890.66.
200;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-07-21T23:33:33Z;Texas Instruments earnings fall short;;Shares in Texas Instruments fell nearly 13 per cent in extended trading on Monday after the second largest US chipmaker disappointed Wall Street with its second-quarter earnings.TI continued to lose ground in supplying chips for mobile phones and blamed weakening economic conditions for slower demand.The company, based in Dallas, Texas, reported profits of $588m or 44 cents a share on revenues of $3.35bn. Analysts expected earnings per share of 46 cents on revenues of $3.39bn.TI also fell short with its third-quarter outlook. It predicted profits of 41 to 47 cents a share on sales of $3.26bn-$3.54bn. Analysts had expected on average profits of 51 cents per share on sales of $3.57bn, according to Reuters Estimates.TI said demand had slowed unexpectedly in June, primarily because distributors reduced inventory levels and did not replenish them. Revenues for wireless chips declined in the quarter in an extension of first-quarter weakness.”We believe this slower demand was due to a mix of reasons, including a weaker economic environment and greater confidence in TI’s ability to deliver products within short lead times,” said Rich Templeton, chief executive.”Our orders were up in the quarter and backlog grew, but we are cautious given the demand environment we just experienced.”Revenues were down 2 per cent on the year-ago quarter as growth in analogue and embedded processing chips could not offset the declines in its wireless and other businesses. Wireless revenues were down 12 per cent on a year earlier.TI make chips for a broad range of industries but lost its position as number-one wireless chipmaker last year to its San Diego rival Qualcomm, as the largest handset makers moved from single-sourcing to buying chips from multiple vendors.TI shares fell 12.7 per cent to $24.90 in after-hours trading in New York and were already down 25 per cent over the past year based on Monday’s official closing price of $28.52.
201;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
202;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-06-24T18:13:46Z;Nokia to take full control of Symbian;;Nokia struck back against Google on Tuesday by announcing plans to increase sales of its mobile phones and boost its revenue from wireless web services.The world’s largest handset maker announced it was taking control of Symbian, the UK software company responsible for the most popular operating system on smartphones.Nokia will contribute the computer code behind Symbian’s operating system to a new non-profit organisation to be called the Symbian Foundation. The foundation will make the code available for free to software developers, in a move aimed at spurring innovation in the mobile internet.Nokia is also handing to the foundation the code behind the S60, its user interface for smartphones. Last year, Google announced plans for its Android mobile software platform, which will also be made available on an open source basis.Google’s move, together with Apple’s unveiling of its iPhone last year, underlined how Symbian is facing increasing competition in software for smartphones.Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia chief executive, said the company’s acquisition of Symbian and the creation of the foundation were a “milestone in our software strategy”.The code held by the foundation will be made available progressively on an open source basis to web developers from next year, and in full by 2010. Analysts said the move would spur innovation and accelerate the pace at which mobile software applications are rolled out.Significantly, mobile makers that are members of the Symbian Foundation will no longer have to pay royalties for use of Symbian’s operating system or Nokia’s S60 user interface from next year. The mobile makers pay royalties worth $5 per phone to Symbian but Nokia declined to disclose its fees.Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, the research and advisory firm, said the end of royalties should cut the cost of Nokia’s mobiles. Google said: “Openness fosters innovation, benefiting consumers.”The founding members of the Symbian Foundation are: Nokia, Samsung Electronics, Motorola, LG, Sony Ericsson, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, AT&T, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone.Nokia is paying €264m ($411m) to buy the 52 per cent of Symbian it does not own. The transaction will dilute its earnings in 2009, but become accretive in 2011.
203;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-05-27T19:15:47Z;Infineon and on and on;;So farewell, Dr Wolfgang Ziebart. The Infineon chief executive resigned on Wednesday, after four years in charge of the German semiconductor maker. Differences of opinion with the board over strategic direction is the official reason but it seems likely that his failure to follow through on a good idea – getting out of the memory market – may have ultimately cost him the job. The new chief executive must be much more ruthless.In 2006 the group, sensibly, decided to float a minority stake in its memory division QiMonda. Producing D-ram memory chips is a volatile commodity business. But while the unit is now listed separately in New York, Infineon still holds 78 per cent of QiMonda. Meanwhile, D-ram prices have collapsed and losses have ballooned. If a recovering memory market later this year provides an opportunity to exit completely, it should be taken.Resolution in wireless communications may also be needed. The unit has been hamstrung since Siemens, until then its largest customer, stopped making mobile phones in 2005. Parts of the business have gone but, without a serious presence in 3G, Infineon lacks the size to really challenge the entrenched positions of Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.Yet radical action of this sort seems improbable. Peter Bauer, head of Infineon’s one good business – the automotive and industrial manufacturing division – will pick up the broom for now. A board member for almost a decade, he seems unlikely to challenge the consensus. Instead, a new programme to raise margins is under way and, worryingly, a merger or takeover of private equity-owned NXP is reportedly being considered. The heavily leveraged NXP has an automotive unit generating sales of €1bn that would fit but its lossmaking home appliances business, with sales of €700m, would not. Strapping together two leaky ships would not make them float any better.Post and read comments on this Lex
204;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-04-23T02:55:01Z;Banks help China buck downward trend;;Chinese stocks staged an impressive rally on Tuesday after the Shanghai composite index briefly traded more than 50 per cent down from last October’s record high.The benchmark fell as much as 4.4 per cent to a 13-month low of 2,990.79 before recovering to close 1 per cent higher at 3,147.79.Malcolm Wood, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said that given the poor state of investor confidence, any small piece of good news could lift shares in Shanghai.“We are looking at first-quarter earnings starting to come out, and the numbers are still OK. Maybe people are thinking that things would have been a lot worse.”Among the big movers on Tuesday, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China rose 2.5 per cent to Rmb6.14, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank climbed 5.1 per cent to Rmb32.61 and China Railway Construction rose 4.9 per cent to Rmb11.09.Jinduicheng Molybdenum, which listed last week, shed 6.3 per cent to Rmb19.52.Hong Kong was boosted by the mainland’s recovery, with refiner PetroChina jumping 6.5 per cent to HK$10.78 and rival Sinopec up 5.1 per cent to HK$7.85.The Hang Seng index closed 0.9 per cent higher at 24,939.15 and the index of China Enterprise stocks, or H shares, rose 3.1 per cent to 13,420.22.But Lenovo, the PC maker, dropped as much as 5.5 per cent before finishing 2.2 per cent lower at HK$5.84 after IBM sold a big block of shares at a 6 per cent discount to Lenovo’s closing price on Monday. IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo in May 2005.China Mobile, the mainland’s largest mobile phone operator, fell 2.1 per cent to HK$131.90 in spite of a 37 per cent rise in first-quarter profit.Most other markets in the region were led down by banking and technology stocks.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,547.82 while the broader Topix index slid 1.5 per cent to 1,311.46.Advantest, a big maker of semiconductor-testing equipment, lost 4 per cent to Y2,880 after US chipmaker Texas Instruments cut its profit forecast.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest brokerage, fell 2.5 per cent to Y1,663 after it said Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission was investigating allegations of insider trading in the mergers and acquisitions department.Trading in South Korea was dominated by news that Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee was stepping down after being charged last week for tax evasion and breach of trust.The Kospi retreated 0.7 per cent to 1,787.49 as Samsung C&T, Samsung’s construction and trading arm, lost 9 per cent to Won70,700.The effect on other Samsung Group companies and affiliates was mixed. Samsung Engineering fell 3.9 per cent to Won90,000 and Hotel Shilla fell 7.4 per cent to Won26,850.But Samsung Card, the financial services provider, rose 1.3 per cent to Won55,800 and Samsung Electronics rose 0.1 per cent to Won675,000.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.6 cent lower at 5,564.60, with the materials sector accounting for more than half of the decline.ABC Learning Centres, the world’s biggest listed operator of childcare centres, rose 45.6 per cent to A$1.98 on news it had finalised the sale of 60 per cent of its US business to Morgan Stanley Private Equity, cutting debt levels.ABC shares lost more than 60 per cent earlier this year when the fast-growing company said it would struggle to repay debts.
205;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Wall St lower amid mixed earnings news;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second session on Tuesday as a mixed batch of earnings reports fanned fears that a slowing domestic economy would hurt corporate profits and spiralling oil prices threatened to further hobble the US consumer.The consumer discretionary sector was the leading faller in the S&P 500, dropping 1.7 per cent, dented by a series of disappointing results and oil at nearly $120 a barrel.Meredith tumbled 13.8 per cent to $32.19 after the media company cut its full year forecast while Dillards dived 10.7 per cent to $20.51 amidst the broader sell-off.McDonald’s results also unsettled investors. The restaurant chain said first-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates but comparable-store sales in the US dropped for the first time in five years. McDonald’s shares slipped 0.5 per cent to $58.35.The technology sector was hit by weak forecasts and figures from Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, and Lexmark, the printer manufacturer.Texas matched estimates but warned of softness in the market for mobile phone chips, while Lexmark said sales slipped giving bleak reminders that technology is not immune from a slowing global economy. Texas shares lost 5.8 per cent to $28.82, Lexmark plunged 8.4 per cent to $32.36 and an index of technology stocks gave up 1.2 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 pared losses towards the close, but still ended the day down 0.9 per cent at 1,375.98, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,376.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.8 per cent to 12,720.31.Stocks had narrowly broken a four-day winning streak on Monday after Bank of America reported lower earnings and soaring provisions for bad loans.Financials suffered then and fell again. CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives exchange, said first-quarter profits more than doubled to $284m and revenue rose 88 per cent to $625m, but that was below average estimates. CME shares dropped 7.6 per cent to $483.50.CIT was the leading faller, tumbling 15.6 per cent to $10.75 after the beleaguered commercial lender said it would sell $1.5bn of common stock and preferred shares to raise cash.There were some bright spots. DuPont, the chemical company, said first-quarter profits rose 26 per cent to $1.19bn after record grain prices boosted sales of its pesticides. However, DuPont shares, which were up about 14 per cent over the past month, fell back 4 per cent to $50.16 as investors focused on comments that weak US demand may sap international strength.AT&T, the biggest phone company in the US, outperformed after first-quarter profit jumped 22 per cent to $3.46bn thanks to strong sales of mobile handsets and cost savings from acquisitions. Sales climbed 6.1 per cent to $30.7bn, meeting Wall Street’s estimates and sending the shares up 0.6 per cent to $37.81.The splurge of corporate results reinforced the dominant theme of the US earnings season so far. Domestic-focused companies have showed sluggish growth while those with global exposure have proved more resilient.Energy stocks added to their recent winning run and the sector was the only one in the S&P 500 to find consistent positive momentum.Chevron and Hess followed oil prices higher, climbing 1.4 per cent to $94.03 and 2.9 per cent to $115.80 respectively.But results from several oil services companies fell short of sky-high expectations. Smith International shares fell 1.7 per cent to $76.69, Baker Hughes lost 0.9 per cent to $81.12 and BJ Services plunged 14.7 per cent to $27.98.And airlines tumbled on higher fuel costs and news of bigger-than-expected losses at United Airlines. UAL fell 36.8 per cent to $13.55 while Continental Airlines dropped 16.8 per cent to $17.20.In other earnings news, UnitedHealth Group missed analyst estimates for the first quarter and the company cut its profit goals for the year.UHG shares lost 9.7 per cent to $34.15 and peers Cigna and Aetna dipped 5.9 per cent to $39.83 and 4.2 per cent to $40.38 respectively.Housing stocks also fell on Tuesday after new data showed existing-home sales slowed more than expected in March.Pulte Homes lost 5.3 per cent to $13.82, while KB Home slid 3.5 per cent to $23.55.
206;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-04-22T09:56:09Z;Asian stock markets go into retreat;;Most Asia-Pacific stock markets on Tuesday retreated after making solid gains the previous session, with Shanghai spending most of the day below the level marking a halving in value from its peak in October last year before mounting a last-minute recovery.The Shanghai Composite Index fell as much as 4 per cent to 2,991.104 – its first drop below 3,000 since March 19, 2007 and well below the 3,062 level which marks a 50 per cent decline from the peak of 6,124.044 hit during trading on October 16, 2007. But a late surge in shares of some of China’s biggest companies helped erase losses and the index closed 1 per cent higher at 3,147.79.Malcolm Wood, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said that given the poor state of investor confidence, any small piece of good news could lift shares in Shanghai. “We are looking at first-quarter earnings starting to come out, and the numbers are still OK. Maybe people are thinking that things would have been a lot worse.”Valuations had become a lot more realistic recently, he said. Shanghai’s price-earnings ratio has fallen from a peak of more than 50 times historic earnings last year to just 25x. The forward-looking p/e is around 19x.Beseiged by subprime worries and analyst assessments that equities were overvalued, Shanghai shares have plunged over the past six months as fast as they surged in the first part of 2007. The Shanghai Composite jumped 141 per cent between mid-February 2007 and its October peak, at which point it had risen 500 per cent since July 2005.Among the big movers in Shanghai on Tuesday, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China rose 2.5 per cent to Rmb6.14, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank jumped 5.1 per cent to Rmb32.61 and China Railway Construction rose 4.9 per cent to Rmb11.09..Jinduicheng Molybdenum, which listed last week, shed 6.3 per cent to Rmb19.52.Hong Kong equities gained as refiner PetroChina jumped 6.5 per cent to HK$10.78 and rival Sinopec rose 5.1 per cent to HK$7.85. The Hang Seng index closed 0.9 per cent higher at 24,939.15 and the main sub-index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong rose 3.1 per cent to 13,420.22.However, Lenovo, the PC maker, dropped as much as 5.5 per cent before finishing 2.2 per cent lower at HK$5.84 after US computer company IBM sold a big block of shares at a 6 per cent discount to Lenovo’s closing price on Monday. IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo in May 2005.China Mobile, the mainland’s largest mobile phone operator, fell 2.1 per cent to HK$131.90 despite a 37 per cent rise in first-quarter profit.Elsewhere, the MSCI Asia Pacific index was down 1 per cent at 147.24 by late afternoon in Tokyo, led by banks and technology shares. Oil hovered near its record high of $117.60 a barrel, with Nymex light sweet crude trading at $117.50 late in the afternoon in Singapore.Banks suffered after Bank of America’s announcement of a 77 per cent fall in quarterly profits on credit crisis-related losses. Mizuho Financial fell 4.7 per cent to Y448,000 and Sumitomo Mitsui shed 4.3 per cent to Y763,000. Australia & New Zealand Banking fell 1.7 per cent to A$21.14.The Nikkei 225 average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,547.82 with shares in banks, electronics companies and carmakers accounting for nearly two-thirds of the fall. The broader Topix index slid 1.5 per cent to 1,311.46. The yen strengthened as far as Y102.78 per dollar, but was trading back beyond Y103 by late afternoon in Tokyo.Advantest, a big maker of semiconductor-testing equipment, saw the biggest fall. It lost 4.0 per cent to Y2,880 after the chipmaker Texas Instruments cut its profit forecast.Sony slid 2.8 per cent to Y4,510 after CLSA cut its rating to “underperform” from “sell”. That also sapped confidence in Canon, which lost 2.6 per cent to Y5,240.Nissan Motor dropped 3.6 per cent to Y886 after a downgrade by Nikko Citigroup, dragging down the sector. Toyota fell 2.6 per cent to Y5,230 and Honda lost 2.7 per cent to Y3,240.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest brokerage, fell 2.5 per cent to Y1,663 after saying Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is investigating allegations of insider trading in the mergers and acquisitions department.Trading in South Korea was dominated by news that Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee was stepping down after being charged last week for tax evasion and breach of trust.The Kospi retreated 0.7 per cent to 1,787.49 as Samsung C&T, Samsung Group’s construction and trading arm, slumped 9.0 per cent to Won70,700.The effect on other Samsung Group members and affiliates was mixed. Samsung Engineering fell 3.9 per cent to Won90,000 and Hotel Shilla fell 7.4 per cent to Won26,850. But Samsung Card, the financial services provider, rose 1.3 per cent to Won55,800 and Samsung Electronics, which has a comparatively more diversified set of shareholders, rose 0.1 per cent to Won675,000.Elsewhere on the Seoul market, First Fire & Marine Insurance surged 14.7 per cent to Won17,950 – an 11-year high – after Hanwha said it would buy a stake in the company. Hanwha shares fell 5.0 per cent to Won54,700.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.6 cent lower at 5,564.60, with the materials sector accounting for more than half of the decline. BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, lost 0.9 per cent to A$43.58 while its takeover target Rio Tinto fell 1.4 per cent to A$142.50.Macarthur Coal rose 6.2 per cent to A$16.14 despite saying it expects annual sales to drop by 10 per cent. The company, one of the world’s biggest producers of pulverized coal for power stations and making steel, on Monday revealed a takeover approach from an unnamed bidder. Its stock has risen 21.5 per cent in two days.ABC Learning Centres, the world’s biggest listed operator of childcare centres, surged 45.6 per cent to A$1.98 on news it had finalised the sale of 60 per cent of its US business to Morgan Stanley Private Equity, cutting debt levels. ABC shares slumped more than 60 per cent earlier this year when the fast-growing company said it would struggle to repay debts.In India, the Sensex was 0.5 per cent higher by midafternoon in Mumbai at 16,821.06. Tata Consultancy Services slumped 9.5 per cent to Rs898.90 after reporting its slowest profit growth in 12 quarters.
207;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-04-21T22:43:33Z;TI blames downturn for cautious forecast;;Texas Instruments has blamed economic uncertainty for a worse-than-expected outlook for America’s second largest chipmaker.TI had warned last month that its first-quarter revenues would be lower than expected and it followed up with a “conservative” second-quarter forecast that disappointed analysts.Its caution was a contrast to the comments of the world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, last week. Its earnings had cheered a recession-spooked Wall Street with first-quarter sales beating expectations and second-quarter forecasts also better than anticipated.Intel pointed to strength in its core PC microprocessor business. TI has been displaying weakness in its cellphone chip sales, where it has lost its number-one supplier position to Qualcomm.TI, based in Dallas, said revenues declined 8 per cent from the fourth quarter, “primarily due to weaker sales into cell phones, especially high-end cell phones”.Sales were up 3 per cent on the same quarter last year at $3.27bn, just below the mid-point of the revised range of $3.21bn to $3.35bn given in March. Earnings of 43 cents per share, excluding a 6 cents tax benefit, were in line with analyst expectations.TI last month blamed reduced demand for 3G phone chips and a “supplier transition” at Ericsson, a major customer, for its revenue disappointment. Along with Nokia, its biggest customer, Ericsson has begun a strategy of sourcing chips from a number of vendors, rather than depending almost exclusively on TI.TI predicted second-quarter revenues in the range of $3.24bn to $3.50bn and earnings per share of 42 to 48 cents. Analysts had forecast revenues of $3.32bn to $3.54bn and earnings of 44 to 51 cents.“Given uncertainty in the near-term economy, we have become more conservative with our outlook for the second quarter,” the company said.TI’s shares were down 2.5 per cent at $29.82 in after-hours trading.The company emphasised the strength of its analogue chips, which convert data back and forth from analogue to digital. It said sales were up 20 per cent year-on-year and analogue would be “a great growth opportunity for a very long time”.
208;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-04-03T20:47:13Z;Energy and materials stocks lift Wall St;;Wall Street stocks rose slightly on Thursday as investors brushed off worse-than-expected unemployment data and news of rising delinquencies in consumer loans.The number of Americans making claims for unemployment benefits for the first time unexpectedly increased last week while continuing unemployment claims for the previous week rose to the highest since July 2004.That bleak picture was reinforced by an IMF report which noted that the US economy had slowed to a “virtual standstill” and testimony to Congress by Timothy Geithner, President of the New York Fed, who said capital markets are still “substantially impaired”.However, data showing the service sector contracted less than expected in March helped markets pare early losses.And dealers and analysts emphasized that trading was likely to be subdued ahead of Friday’s crucial employment data, which would give a clearer direction to markets.Moderate gains in the materials and energy stocks finally pushed markets into the black just after midday, as they followed commodity prices and analyst estimates higher.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, rose 5.8 per cent to $38.54, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 4 per cent to $103.69 and Monsanto added 5 per cent $117.63.Peabody Energy, the coal company, rose 6 per cent to $55.60 while Consol Energy, a coal and gas company, climbed 4.4 per cent to $71.95.Financials also shrugged off a further round of cuts to analysts’ earnings estimates, this time from Lehman Brothers, after John Thain, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, reaffirmed that his securities firm had no need to raise more capital.Merrill bounced 1.2 per cent to $45.89 while the broader S&P 500 financials index added 0.4 per cent.In New York, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,369.31 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,363.30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,626.03.On Wednesday stocks eased back from an exuberant start to the second quarter after Ben Bernanke’s cautious comments on the economy and a late spike in commodity prices hit equities.Consumers appear to be feeling the squeeze already. According to an American Bankers Association survey they fell behind on a variety of loan repayments at the highest rate in 15 years during the fourth quarter.Consumer discretionary stocks dropped back on the news and were among the day’s biggest fallers. Dillards and Best Buy snapped a three-day winning run, falling 3.2 per cent to $20.40 and 3.2 per cent to $42.53 respectively.Technology stocks helped buoy the market amid a welter of contrasting earnings reports and forecasts.SanDisk leapt after Citigroup analysts said that the stock price of the flash memory maker was approaching a bottom while demand for its products should also improve.Sandisk shares, which have fallen by about half in the last six month, rose 7.5 per cent to $26.47.Micron, the semiconductor maker, posted a bigger second-quarter loss than expected due to a $463m writedown in the value of its memory chip business.The stock climbed 6.3 per cent to $6.79 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company from “sell” to “neutral”, citing the prospects of improving prices for DRAM computer memory chips.Rival semiconductor manufacturers LSI and Texas Instruments climbed 7.1 per cent to $5.43 and 2 per cent to $30.13 respectively.That news helped offset a downgrade to Cisco, the world’s biggest maker of computer-networking equipment. Cisco shares fell 2.9 per cent to $24.23 after UBS cut its recommendation on the shares to “neutral.”“Our industry checks show orders are slowing which gives us concern about the July quarter,” UBS analysts said.Sun Microsystems dropped 0.1 per cent to $15.95 and Hewlett-Packard fell 0.5 per cent to $46.96.Research In Motion stock found momentum nonetheless, rising 5.9 per cent to $122.58 after the maker of the BlackBerry reported estimate-beating fourth-quarter results.“Confessional” season, when companies report their preliminary earnings forecasts for past quarter, kept pharmaceutical, healthcare and other companies in focus.Earnings upgrades lifted the medical device makers AngioDynamics and ATS Medical. The pair rose 10.8 per cent to $12.80 and 15 per cent to $1.68 respectively.
209;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Infineon’s value;;Infineon, its stock down almost 70 per cent from last summer’s peak, has a market capitalisation of €3.3bn. Yet since its first set of results issued shortly after listing at the height of the technology bubble in March 2000, it has reported full-year profits just once: in 2004, the semiconductor maker produced earnings of €61m. Losses are anticipated again this year. Why is it worth so much?The answer is that the group has one good business, alongside two mediocre ones. The Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing (Aim) division generates three-quarters of group sales and has always been profitable. Number two in the global automotive chip market behind private equity-owned Freescale, it has expanded its market share for the past three years. Meanwhile, rising electronic content in cars makes this one of the fastest growing areas for semiconductors.Then there is QiMonda, and communications. The latter division has some products with promise, but has only dallied with breakeven in recent years. Optimistically, profits are at least a year away. The wireless chip market is dominated by Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. Without a serious presence in 3G, it is debateable whether Infineon’s unit is viable in the long term.QiMonda – listed separately in New York, but still 75 per cent owned by Infineon – makes D-ram memory chips, a market suffering its worst slump ever. That said, manufacturers have curbed expansion, and prices have stabilised. Recovery later this year would provide better conditions to sell off more of QiMonda.Adjust Infineon’s valuation for the market value of QiMonda. Then factor in a worst-case valuation for the communications business of zero. On that basis, Infineon trades on about one times the sales of its Aim division – relatively low for a growing semiconductor business.Reporting in dollars, Infineon has a problem in the form of a strong euro, and the management so far seems disinclined to bite the bullet on communications. But given that low multiple of sales, the question regarding Infineon’s valuation might equally be, why is it worth so little?Post and read comments on this Lex
210;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-03-19T21:03:00Z;Sony Ericsson slides;;In its 2007 annual report, published earlier this month, Ericsson concludes that “our strategy has been effective and should not be changed”. Perhaps not, but the latest upset – a profit warning from Sony Ericsson, the Swedish company’s handset joint venture – suggests that market conditions, at least, are unfavourable. Down 8 per cent on Wednesday, shares in Ericsson have lost almost two-thirds of their value in the past six months.Sony Ericsson’s problem is a lack of growth in sales of mid-market and high-end phones. First-quarter revenues will fall about 10 per cent year-on-year. Coupled with higher spending on research and development ahead of the introduction of several new phones later this year, operating margins will almost halve in the first quarter. A slowing market looks partly to blame, with consumers taking longer to replace mobiles. While similar weakness is yet to be reported by handset competitors, the story fits with a recent warning from Texas Instruments, which suffered order cancellations for chips used in 3G phones.The prognosis, then, for Ericsson is not great. The hit from the handset joint venture should cut Ericsson’s earnings forecasts for this year by at least a tenth. Meanwhile, the outlook for telecoms infrastructure continues to darken. The shift to 3G means that the 2G market is now clearly in decline in developed countries. Yet if adoption of the high-end phones that drive data usage also slows, there will be less pressure on the telecoms operators to add capacity to their 3G networks. At the same time pricing remains brutal in developing markets, where growth seems likely to slow in 2009, as network rollouts are completed in several countries.At €10.60 a share, Ericsson is still well above its post-bubble 2002 low of €3.60. As earnings slump for the second time this decade, investors can at least console themselves that this time round Ericsson’s balance sheet looks in decent shape.
211;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-03-16T22:03:48Z;US technology groups cut back on research;;Some of the biggest US technology companies have put a lid on their research and development spending even as the industry enjoys its strongest period of growth this decade, according to the latest financial filings.With a US economic downturn looming, the pressure to hold down spending is expected to intensify further this year.The data, analysed by the Financial Times, point to the pressure that companies in some parts of the tech industry – particularly hardware makers and semiconductor companies – have been under to raise profit margins even in good times.Leaving aside Google, which increased spending strongly, the 10 biggest tech spenders capped the growth in their R&D budgets last year at 4.1 per cent, at a time when their revenues jumped by more than 9 per cent. The biggest makers of computer systems held their spending broadly flat, while semiconductor companies cut back in the face of a downturn in the chip cycle.However, analysts warn that figures for a single year should be treated cautiously. Richard Kaiser, a tech analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said: “I don’t view it as a radical change in the spending environment,” said .Corporate spending on R&D typically rises and falls in line with revenues, though with a time lag, says Jules Duga, senior researcher at Battelle Memorial Institute, a US non-profit re-search organisation. Revenue growth in tech tends to be more volatile than in many other sectors, exposing the industry to bigger swings in research budgets when markets turn down.The spending growth in 2007 dropped from a heady 11.6 per cent for the same group of companies in 2006, though that figure was boosted in part by the inclusion of employee option costs in the figures for the first time.Even those tech companies that have benefited most from the industry’s recent strength held the growth in their research and development spending below their growth in revenues, in spite of adding considerably to their research efforts.For Microsoft and Cisco, R&D fell as a proportion of revenues by at least a percentage point each last year, a reflection of the operating leverage they gain as they generate higher revenues from the same base of fixed costs.Only a handful of the 20 biggest spenders recorded an increase in R&D as a proportion of revenues last year. Yet for two of those – Motorola and Texas Instruments – that was because revenues fell.Google was an exception. The internet search company’s R&D budget jumped 73 per cent to $2.1bn last year, putting it among the industry’s top 10 spenders for the first time.Google’s R&D spending now eats up nearly 13 per cent of its revenues, more than double the proportion of five years ago. R&D spending at EMC, the world’s biggest maker of data storage equipment, jumped 20 per cent last year to $1.53bn, also outpacing sales growth.
212;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-03-11T20:41:27Z;Wall St enjoys best one-day rise since 2002;;US stocks enjoyed their best one-day advance in more than five years on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced a $200bn plan to boost liquidity at troubled financial firms.Banking stocks surged with financial firms chalking up gains of more than 10 per cent, as traders rushed to cover short positions. The central bank plan helped allay fears that liquidity pressures were spiralling out of control.Energy companies and other commodity producers were among the best performers as crude oil surged to another record.The S&P 500 closed up 3.7 per cent at 1,320.63 points, its best performance since October 2002. The Nasdaq Composite soared 4 per cent to 2,255.76 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,156.81 points.The co-ordinated central bank announcement was a welcome salve for equity investors alarmed at the pattern of recent selling.Until Tuesday the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had warned that “hopelessness” was setting in.The Fed plan to lend up to $200bn of Treasury securities to primary dealers on a 28-day term soothed some of these worries. The plan allows dealers to park a variety of collateral, including mortgage-backed securities, which have declined rapidly in price and have become difficult to trade.The latest announcement brought to $400bn the total amount of new short-term funds made available by the Fed over the past week.Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “The Fed taking mortgages as collateral should help ease liquidity concerns. This is a way to really attack the problems at their route rather than just cutting interest rates.”After the announcement the futures market trimmed odds of a 75bp rate cut when the federal open market committee meets next week.Although the market reaction was very supportive some analysts were more sceptical.David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: “We still believe today’s action is not nearly a large enough step to make a big difference.”Stocks moved sharply higher on the Fed news with gains concentrated in the financial sector. An analysis by Bespoke Investment Group suggested some of Tuesday’s rally was driven by traders closing out short positions.Among the big movers were Citigroup, up 9.1 per cent at $21.49, Lehman Brothers, 7.8 per cent higher at $46.31, and Countrywide Financial, up 17.2 per cent at $5.11.Washington Mutual rose as much as 25.5 per cent on speculation it could receive a cash infusion from an outside investor. It closed up 18.3 per cent at $11.88.Bear Stearns was particularly volatile, falling as much as 19 per cent from its intraday peak, amid persistent talk – which it denied – that it faced liquidity problems. Bear closed up 1.1 per cent at $62.97 on reports Joseph Lewis, the British billionaire investor, was looking to increase his stake.Investors were also cheered by a smaller US trade deficit increase than expected. The gap between imports and exports widened 0.6 per cent in January, excluding costly oil imports but the deficit narrowed to a five-year low, as the weaker dollar boosted exports.Energy companies moved higher as crude oil futures rose above $109. ExxonMobil put on 5.1 per cent to $86.68 and Noble, the rig operator, rose 7.6 per cent to $50.48.Citing “out of control” oil prices and rising costs, Credit Suisse downgraded the airline sector from “overweight” to “market weight”. NorthWest Airlines shed 0.8 per cent to $12.23.Also trading to the downside was chipmaker Texas Instruments, which cut its first quarter earnings and revenue outlook.The shares dropped 3 per cent to $28.76. In telecoms, Sprint Nextel, the troubled mobile phone operator briefly hit a 20-year low. The shares closed 8.2 per cent lower at $6.17.Health insurer WellPoint cut its 2008 earnings outlook because of high costs and the deteriorating economy. Its shares plunged 28.3 per cent to $47.26.
213;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Companies to disclose political aid;;Five large US companies, including American Express and Xerox, will bow to shareholder pressure on Thursday and agree to disclose all their political spending.The move by the companies, which also include the financial groups Washington Mutual and Capital One and the technology provider Texas Instruments, could put pressure on the rest of corporate America to make public its political contributions. US companies are not required to disclose details of political payments and, in spite of growing concerns over lobbying by large businesses, only 38 have so far agreed to reveal all their political spending.“This move is very important,” said Bruce Freed of the Center for Political Accountability, which together with unions and socially focused investors is campaigning on the issue. “There is much greater acceptance in the corporate community of political transparency and accountability.”US companies are banned from contributing to congressional and presidential candidates, but in 2002, the last main election cycle, their donations to state and local candidates reached $184m (£92m) – more than a third of all campaign contributions. Campaigners argue that much corporate political spending goes through trade associations and other interest groups that back candidates whose positions often conflict with those of the companies’ shareholders. Interest groups are expected to spend more than $1bn in this presidential election.Like the other 38 companies, American Express, Xerox, Washington Mutual, Capital One and Texas Instruments will reveal details of payments to these groups as well as to candidates. American Express’s 2007 corporate contributions report shows it spent about $135,000 on political donations last year. Recipients included Eliot Spitzer, governor of New York state and former Wall Street scourge, who received $1,000, and Republican and Democratic fundraising committees. “We have always provided a report about our activity on request. We have now posted [it] to our website to make the information even more easily available to those who want it,” the company said.Scott Gaspard at Washington Mutual said: “Good corporate governance dictates transparency, which is why we decided to make our political contributions available.”Texas Instruments said it had decided to disclose its contributions before being pressed by the investors, adding it wanted to “provide shareholders with transparency on the issue they want to know about”.Xerox said it did not use corporate funds to back political officials and would publicise its contributions to trade associations. Capital One was not available for comment.
214;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-02-05T23:00:20Z;ARM holds on to its lossmaker;;"Shares in ARM Holdings lost a fifth of their value on Tuesday after the microchip designer revealed a 15 per cent fall in overall profits and a sharp decline in sales at its physical intellectual property division.ARM, which designs chips used in mobile phones and iPods, bought Artisan for $913m in 2004, but has had to spend more time and money turning it round than anticipated. It revealed that revenues at the physical IP division had fallen to $19.5m (£9.9m) in the fourth quarter, 30 per cent down from the same period a year ago.The division accounts for just 17 per cent of Arm’s overall revenues but is acting as a drag on overall performance. Shareholders are questioning the wisdom of the acquisition.However, any disposal of the unit would probably come at a considerable loss. The business is worth half what ARM paid for Artisan, analysts estimate.Warren East, chief executive, would not rule out a disposal “in due course” if the division failed to perform, but insisted it was
still at an early stage of a turnround strategy of four to six years.In September the company sent Simon Segars, an executive and board member, to California to oversee the division.The physical IP division provides libraries of components used in computer chips. As chips become more complicated, ARM believes, more microprocessor makers will want to buy in ready-made components to speed up the design process.But Artisan’s technology lagged behind the rest of the industry and ARM has had to plough huge resources into catching up.It has yet to win one of the big three semiconductor makers – Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Broadcom – as clients for the division.Overall revenues for 2007 fell 2 per cent to £259.2m, mainly because of the weakening of the dollar against sterling.On a dollar basis revenues grew 6 per cent and Mr East said growth would be at similar levels for 2008. But this estimate is far below analysts’ consensus of 15 per cent growth for the current year.Pre-tax profits fell from £57m to £48.2m and earnings per share emerged at 2.7p (3.2p). The shares dropped 20 per cent to 94¼p, their lowest level since the end of 2004."
215;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Wall Street stages powerful rebound;;US equities staged a powerful rebound on Wednesday and broke a five-day losing run, led by financials as hopes grew that bond insurers will receive a hefty capital injection.At the close, the S&P 500 index had risen 2.1 per cent to 1,338.60 after falling to a low of 1,270.05 (down 3.1 per cent) in early trade.The recovery in stocks was powered by a 9.7 per cent swing in the S&P financials sector, which closed up 6.8 per cent.The sector gained appreciably during the afternoon when news broke that the largest US banks were under pressure from New York State insurance regulators to provide as much as $15bn in fresh capital to support struggling bond insurers, people familiar with the matter said.JPMorgan rose 11.9 per cent to $45.72, a six-week high, while Citi jumped 8 per cent to $26.36. Bond insurer, MBIA rose 32.6 per cent to $16.61 while Ambac rallied 72 per cent to $13.70.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the the recovery in the main benchmarks and closed 2.5 per cent higher at 12,270.17, and rebounded from a low of 11,644.81, down 2.7 per cent earlier in the day.Among the leading benchmarks, the Nasdaq Composite at one stage entered official bear market territory on Wednesday, down more than 20 per cent from its peak in October. A guarded outlook from Apple hurt sentiment for technology stocks.The Nasdaq closed up 1.1 per cent at 2,316.41, after falling 3.9 per cent to a low of 2,202.54 earlier in the day.Although Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profits on Tuesday, its lower outlook sent the shares down 10.7 per cent to $139, but up from an intra-day low of $126.14.Ahead of releasing results after the closing bell, Ebay rose 6.5 per cent to $28.90, after it hit a 52-week low of $26.02 on Tuesday.Motorola plunged 18.8 per cent to $10.01, after its quarterly net profits fell 84 per cent. The mobile phone maker also warned that its turnround strategy will take longer than expected.Earlier in the day, a number of big S&P sectors including energy, materials, technology and telecoms fell more than 5 per cent before those losses were completely reversed.There was a sense that investors who had previously sold banks and bought stocks exposed to the global economy and commodities, such as energy, materials and industrials had reversed that strategy.Traders also said that the use of some algorithmic trading systems were curtailed amid higher equity volatility and the breakdown of recent relationships between sectors. Equity volatility as measured by the Vix index rose 11 per cent during the day, before closing down 7 per cent as the market rebounded.General Dynamics said quarterly profit rose 42 per cent, and while the defence contractor projected lower full-year earnings and the stock rosse 0.3 per cent to $79.05.United Technologies reported a 23 per cent gain in quarterly earnings and reiterated its profit outlook sending the stock up 5.6 per cent to $70.98.Pfizer recorded quarterly profit and sales that exceeded estimates. The drugs group’s stock had rose 2.8 per cent to $22.86.Texas Instruments said fourth-quarter profit rose 13 per cent and stock rose 4.6 per cent to $30.30.As the fourth-quarter earnings season swung into a higher gear on Wednesday, investors were rattled by a further reduction in the outlook for profits.According to Thomson Financial, the estimated blended rate for fourth-quarter earnings, after the latest corporate results on Wednesday, projected a decline of 19.6 per cent.It is shaping up to be the worst quarter for corporate earnings since a decline of 21.5 per cent in year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings in 2001.The estimate for first-quarter earnings this year is a rise of 3.7 per cent, but that is down from a projected rise of 5.7 per cent at the start of the month, according to Thomson.Of greater concern for investors is how companies are failing to beat estimates.“In a definite sign that the earnings-led bull run over the last five years has ended, the percentage of companies beating earnings estimates is at 53 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2007, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2001,” said analysts at Bespoke Investments.“We have mentioned in the past that a big decline in the ‘beat rate’ would be an ominous sign, and the data is showing that this decline has come.”In spite of the rebound, sentiment among traders and analysts remains cautious.“Given an awful beginning for stock prices and the unlikely proposition for earnings to provide much relief near-term, we no longer believe that first half-equity-market strength will be achieved,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.He said a second-half rebound was now probable, but cautioned that “trying definitively to call the market’s bottom seems risky”.Citi also lowered its 2008 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 1,550 from a prior estimate of 1,675.
216;TXN;Texas Instruments;2008-01-23T01:58:55Z;Texas boosted by analogue products;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, saw strength in its analogue and digital signal processing semiconductors in the fourth quarter, producing revenues in line with Wall Street expectations.Dallas-based TI reported revenues of $3.56bn, slightly below the $3.58bn midpoint of its updated forecast in December.Earnings per share of 54 cents, which included a one-cent tax benefit, were slightly ahead of the analyst consensus of 52 cents, surveyed by Reuters Estimates.Shares rose 2 per cent in after-hours trading to $29.57 on the news. They are down 13 per cent this month and have fallen by 24 per cent in the past six months as TI has been overtaken by Qualcomm as the leading maker of mobile phone chips.TI makes chips for a wide range of industries, from automotive to consumer electronics, and has sought to emphasise the growth of its analogue chips in converting sound and pictures into digital information.“Most important to our future performance, we sharpened our focus on analogue with increases in dedicated research and development, sales support and manufacturing capacity,” said Rich Templeton, chief executive.He said TI expected year-over-year growth to accelerate in 2008 in its semiconductor operations.Fourth-quarter revenues were up 3 per cent on the same quarter in 2006. Sales of digital signal processors and high-performance analogue products were up 12 per cent.Compared with the third quarter, revenues were down 3 per cent due to the expected seasonal decline in sales of its famous graphing calculators.The company said it expected revenues of $3.27bn to $3.55bn in the first quarter and earnings per share in the range of 43-49 cents.Analysts were expecting first-quarter earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $3.41bn, according to Reuters Estimates.Tech blog: Electronic Arts pursues the casual gamer
217;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-12-11T22:45:11Z;Wall St plummets after Fed rate cut;;Wall Street stocks suffered heavy falls on Tuesday after a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve failed to satisfy anxious traders.Shares had traded modestly higher early in the session but plummeted after the Federal Open Market Committee cut the funds rate and discount rate by just 25 basis points.Many analysts had expected a 50bp cut, particularly on the discount rate, to help alleviate severe liquidity problems in the banking sector and offset the worst effects of the credit squeeze.“It was a bitter pill for the market,” Dr Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said. “It seems like they didn’t go far enough and the market is telling us that this is the case.”Before the Fed decision the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent but these gains were quickly erased and the index fell a further 2.5 per cent to close at 1,477.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.1 per cent to 13,432.77 – falling more than 360 points from its intraday high – while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 per cent to 2,652.35.Among stocks hit hardest by the modest rate cut were financials and homebuilders. The S&P financial index shed 4.9 per cent to 405.62 while the homebuilder index lost 11.4 per cent to 354.22.“Financials are disappointed that the discount window penalty remains intact,” Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said.Transport stocks, a traditional bellwether of economic confidence, also felt heavy selling pressure. The Dow transport index fell 3.4 per cent to 4,734.75.Rate cuts have historically served as a boon for the S&P 500, but with the futures market having fully priced in at least a 25bp cut, any upside from a cut may already have been discounted. The index had hit its highest level in a month at the start of this week.Prior to the rate cut decision, Barclays Capital had warned against expectations of a Fed-induced equity rally, because its sentiment-based equity risk indicator flagged a 90 per cent probability of a near-term sell-off, the most acute reading since 2001.The Fed was seen as being pressured to ease, in part, by the continuing painful fallout from the US housing slump, of which there was ample evidence on Tuesday.H&R Block, the tax preparer, said it expected a net loss of $502.3m for the quarter ended October 31 compared with a loss of $156.5m during the same period last year. Some $366.2m of the expected loss came from the company’s Option One Mortgage subsidiary, which is being shut down. The stock fell 3.3 per cent to $19.30.Shares in Washington Mutual slumped 12.4 per cent to $17.42 after it said it would raise $2.5bn via a preferred stock offering to shore up its finances and expected to report a fourth-quarter loss. The mortgage lender also plans to cut its dividend by almost three-quarters and set aside $1.6bn to cover loan losses.WaMu’s announcement came soon after UBS, the Swiss group, unveiled a $17.2bn recapitalisation plan after revealing another $10bn in writedowns on mortgage-related securities.Citigroup, which last month secured a $7.5bn capital injection from Abu Dhabi, on Tuesday appointed Vikram Pandit, the head of its investment banking business, as chief executive. The shares fell 4.4 per cent to $33.23.After reporting a $2bn loss for the third quarter, Freddie Mac said current quarter performance would be little better. The mortgage agency expects losses on its book of home loans to total $10bn to $12bn in the coming years as the housing slump worsens. Its shares fell 10.6 per cent to $31.31.In other company news, Texas Instruments, up 0.8 per cent at $32.93, upgraded its fourth-quarter sales and profit guidance. Meanwhile AT&T was the best performer on the Dow, rising 4.1 per cent to $39.46 after it raised its dividend by 12.7 per cent. It also plans to buy back 400m shares, worth about $15bn at current prices.General Electric reaffirmed its fourth quarter and full year guidance, increased its dividend by 11 per cent and said it plans to buy back $15bn of common stock over the next three years. The shares fell 1 per cent to $37.03.Burger King gained 1.1 per cent to $27.44 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the shares to “buy” citing its growing international presence.

The smaller European stocks in the sector, however, were lifted by a pick-up in merger activity.SEZ Holding, which develops silicon wafer technology, soared 36.1 per cent to SFr37.15 after US chip equipment maker Lam Research offered $568m in cash for the Swiss company. The deal valued SEZ at SFr38 a share and was expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008.Swiss chipmaker Micronas climbed 11.1 per cent to SFr13 on speculation that it would be the next target in the sector. Micronas has said it is open to offers after its shares have dumped nearly two-thirds of their value this year.Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics, seen more as predator than prey, was down 0.7 per cent to €10.58, while Germany’s Infineon inched 0.2 per cent higher to €8.87.Lafarge remained in the spotlight following Monday’s resounding gains. Analysts on Tuesday raised their price targets for the stock after the world’s largest cement group announced its acquisition of Egypt’s Orascom Cement. Among them, Deutsche Bank raised its target price from €160 to €176, saying the deal was a “win/win for all”.Analyst Imran Akram added: “Lafarge is buying a group of assets which we believe it could not create even within the next 10 years.” The shares rose 1.3 per cent to €123.27.UBS was also in focus for a second-consecutive session as Marcel Ospel, chairman, met investors to discuss the bank’s recent misfortunes.

Traders added that the stock, which fell 23 per cent in November, had been oversold in the past few weeks and presented a good buying opportunity.Property stocks were hit after New Star Asset Management, the UK fund, cut the value of its property portfolio by 8.2 per cent. This led to a 1.2 per cent fall in Austrian property group Immoeast, which closed at €7.70, while France’s Unibail Rodamco shed 1.8 per cent to €157.94.Adidas was up 1.1 per cent to €47.21 after Lehman Brothers initiated coverage on the stock with an “overweight” rating and a €53 price target.
219;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-12-11T00:23:21Z;Mobile handset boosts TI;;Texas Instruments indicated a stronger-than-expected end to the year for mobile handset makers as it raised the lower end of its revenue estimates for the fourth quarter.TI, which makes a range of chips for mobile phones, said it expected revenues of between $3.5bn and $3.66bn in the fourth quarter, compared to its estimate of $3.4bn to $3.68bn given in October at its third-quarter results presentation.“Wireless customers were projecting [in October] that demand for the month of December would decline compared to October and November,” Ron Slaymaker, head of TI investor relations, told an analyst conference call Monday.“But now they can see the levels sustaining through the month of December.”TI’s biggest customer is Nokia, the number one handset maker.TI predicted in October the slowing down of a 3G phone programme by another customer, Ericsson, would be a second contributing factor to a seasonally weaker fourth quarter.Shares in TI rose nearly 5 per cent to $34.19 in after-hours trading on the improved forecast. The Dallas-based company’s position as the leading maker of mobile phone chips has been challenged this year by Qualcomm, as handset makers have sought to diversify in their choice of suppliers.The iSuppli research firm is putting Qualcomm ahead of TI this year with its prediction of a 24 per cent increase in mobile phone revenues to $5.6bn. It expects TI, which makes chips for a number of other industries, to record a 3.4 per cent decline in global semiconductor revenues. TI said Monday it expected earnings per share of 50-54 cents in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous range of 48-54 cents.
220;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-10-26T20:45:30Z;Wall St up on strong earnings;;Wall Street stocks enjoyed their best week in more than a month as investors put aside worries about risky credit market investments, a slowdown in the economy and some mixed corporate earnings.Stellar quarterly results from Microsoft lent support to the continuing surge in technology shares while upbeat guidance from Countrywide Financial raised hopes that mortgage lenders might recover from the housing slump sooner than expected.Expectations of another interest rate cut next week, when the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets, also helped bolster market sentiment. The futures market has priced in a 100 per cent likelihood of at least a 25 basis point rate cut.The S&P 500 index closed 1.4 per cent higher yesterday and gained 2.3 per per cent on the week at 1,535.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.1 per cent over the week at 13,806.70 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.9 per cent at 2,804.19.The utility and technology sectors outperformed this week, while telecoms and industrials showed weakness.

Average earnings have declined 4.9 per cent, hit by poor results from consumer discretionary and financial companies.Microsoft’s third-quarter results helped spur a rally in technology stocks after they beat expectations.

The S&P financial index climbed 2.7 per cent to 451.49, while the investment bank index was 4.7 per cent higher at 204.99.Mortgage lenders and insurers were particularly volatile.

221;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-10-26T00:37:05Z;Arm hit by dollar and Artisan problems;;Sales at Arm Holdings fell during the three months to September because of the weak dollar and slow business at an intellectual property company it bought three years ago, a deal that has faced considerable scepticism.Arm, whose microchip designs are used in about 98 per cent of the world’s mobile phones, said sales in the period were £62.8m, down from £64.8m a year ago and short of analysts’ expectations of £68m.Warren East, chief executive, blamed the dollar and the IP division, formerly know as Artisan.Arm bought Artisan for $913m in 2004. Artisan designs libraries of components used to make up computer chips. As chips become more complicated, with more information squeezed on to a smaller space, Arm believes more microprocessor makers will want ready-made components to speed up design.However, it is having to devote engineering resources to get Artisan ready for the next generation of smaller chips.Mr East “was absolutely confident that buying Artisan was the right thing to do. When we bought it, we said it would take four to seven years to position the business and we’re only two-and-a-half-years into the process.”Pre-tax profit in the period fell from £12.6m to £11.9m while earnings per share fell 0.1p to 0.6p. The shares dropped 4½p to 145p.FT Comment● Artisan is a big gamble. If Texas Instruments, Qualcomm or Broadcom can be persuaded to use Artisan’s library of components, the acquisition will be worth its price. But the pay-off remains unclear. In the meantime, the rest of Arm’s business stands to benefit from smartphones, which include more Arm-designed chips and generate more royalties. For investors who believe the iPhone is the start of a mass trend, Arm remains attractive.

Advantest, a manufacturer of chip-making equipment, lost 2.2 per cent to Y3,500.The stronger yen also delivered a blow to exporters like Toyota Motor, which was recently ousted by General Motors as the world’s biggest automaker. Toyota’s shares dropped 2.27 per cent to Y6,040. Sony, which will announce results on Thursday, dropped 0.96 per cent to Y5,180.The yen was stronger against all major currencies on Wednesday, partly reflecting nervousness in the US ahead of data releases and news of bond-related write-downs at Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank. The yen was at 114.28 to the dollar in London morning trading.Bucking the market trend, Chugai Pharmaceutical leapt 5.3 per cent to Y1,897 as investors rewarded the drugmaker for its strong profit performance in the nine months to September.

224;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-10-23T01:40:42Z;TI warns of flat sales as competition bites;;Texas Instruments warned on Monday that sales of its wireless chips for mobile phones were likely to be flat in the fourth quarter as handset makers began to switch from single-sourcing of their chips.Texas Instruments has been the number one supplier of chips for mobile phones, but is being challenged for supremacy by San Diego-based Qualcomm and also faces competition from other US chipmakers, such as Broadcom and Freescale.In a third-quarter earnings call, Kevin March, TI chief financial officer, said its analog chip business, which covers a wide range of industries, would begin substantially to shape the company and be a driver of growth in the years ahead. It currently accounts for 40 per cent of sales.Mr March predicted a seasonal fourth quarter apart from sales of its wireless chips.He forecast these would be flat compared with the third quarter, when growth of around 8 per cent was normally expected.He said this would be partly because Sony Ericsson had begun to take chips from a second supplier. TI shares were down 3.5 per cent on the news in after-hours trading at $33.06.Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, said at an analyst conference call that TI could also benefit from this “supplier diversification” trend as it has become a second supplier itself.By the middle of next year, TI would be supplying higher-end chips to Motorola, the US mobile phone maker, he said, and although Nokia had announced some diversification, TI would not have a competitor there for its 3G chips until 2010.TI announced that third-quarter revenues fell 3 per cent from a year ago – when customers were building inventories – to $3.66bn.Earnings per share were 52 cents, 7 cents or 16 per cent higher than a year earlier.

226;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-09-21T21:22:33Z;Wall St enjoys best week in six months;;"Wall Street stocks had their best week for six months after the Federal Reserve surprised markets by slashing interest rates by half a percentage point.The S&P 500 on Tuesday enjoyed its biggest one-day gain since March 2003 as investors bet that low interest rates would lend support to the US economy.The decision to cut both the Fed Funds rate and the discount rate – the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed – appeared to calm equity markets as share volatility eased.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, a measure of future market volatility, fell 24 per cent to lows last reached at the end of July before the credit squeeze.Trading volumes were high on the week and on Friday the New York Stock Exchange set a new volume record for the first hour of trading.Equity markets surged even as the dollar fell to a new record low against the euro.The CurrencyShares Euro Trust exchange traded fund, which tracks the price of the euro, closed the week at an all-time high.The S&P 500 was 2.8 per cent higher on the week at 1,525.72, within 1.8 per cent of its all-time high, set in July. The Dow Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.8 per cent at 13,820.19 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.7 per cent at 2,671.22.Large-cap companies saw particularly strong gains. The Russell Top 50 index of the largest US companies by market capitalisation hit its highest level since 2001.“I’m surprised at the strong snap back – it’s almost like we discounted everything that happened over the last three months,” Joe Ranieri, managing director of trading of Canaccord Adams, said. “The weaker dollar is going to be good for earnings at the larger cap companies, particularly in the tech sector.”The Nasdaq was lifted on Friday by some positive earnings news from Oracle and details of a share buyback by Texas Instruments.Google set a new all-time high, up 5.9 per cent for the week at $560.10.However, it was a disappointing week for Microsoft, down 1.3 per cent to $28.65, after a European court upheld a European Commission ruling that the software group had abused its near-monopoly position.Oracle reported a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The stock was up 9.5 per cent on the week at $21.98.Texas Instruments was 5.6 per cent higher at $36.62 after its board approved a $5bn share buyback programme and announced plans to raise its cash dividend by 25 per cent.In other earnings news, Nike said quarterly profit rose 51 per cent. Shares in the athletic shoe and clothing company were flat for the week at $57.26.The week’s earnings news was dominated by the brokerage sector as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns turned in their third-quarter report cards.Goldman and Lehman surprised the market with better-than-expected earnings, up 10.2 per cent to $209.98 and 5.4 per cent to $62.70 on the week, respectively.But Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley disappointed.Shares in Morgan, which reported a 17 per cent third-quarter profit decline, were down 2.5 per cent on the week at $64.44. Bear’s earnings fell 61 per cent after fixed-income revenues plummeted but its shares ended the week flat at $117.32.Transport stocks lagged the market as crude oil set a series of record highs.FedEx, down 4.7 per cent at $104.10, cut its earnings forecast for the year due to higher energy costs and uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook.Shares in Harman International Industries plunged 21.3 per cent to $85.The company confirmed rumours that Goldman Sachs and KKR would not complete their planned $8bn purchase of the audio equipment maker.Mattel, up 6.6 per cent at $23.94, finished the week with an apology to the Chinese people for damaging the reputation of their manufacturers after the recall of around 21m toys. On a
visit to Beijing, Thomas Debrowski, executive vice-president of worldwide operations, said the majority of toys were recalled because of design flaws, not poor Chinese manufacturing.It was another volatile week for homebuilder stocks as positive news about the relaxation of regulation of mortgage lenders was overshadowed by more downbeat data on housing starts, which declined 2.6 per cent in August. But the S&P materials index recorded strong gains as investors bet on the continuing strength of the global construction boom."
227;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-09-12T20:43:23Z;Wall St gives up gains as oil rises above $80;;"US stocks lost steam late on Wednesday, as investors watched oil prices rise above $80 a barrel for the first time, and the dollar set a record low against the euro.The S&P 500 index closed unchanged at 1,471.56, down from a high of 1,479.50 early in the day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,592.07 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 13,291.65.No significant US economic reports were released on Wednesday and Federal Reserve officials had begun their customary period of silence ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The economic calendar is light until Friday when the latest retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. These will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet to discuss monetary policy.At this juncture, investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-
percentage point easing.Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co, said: “The financial markets and the economy need a 50 basis point cut.“There will be disappointment if the Fed cuts 25 basis points.”Until next week’s FOMC meeting, stocks are likely to lack direction, and volatility should remain near recent highs, say traders. Volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index was down 0.9 per cent at 25.04 after a rise to 26.21 in early trade.Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, said: “Volatility is unlikely to diminish nor are volumes likely to pick up before the Fed cuts rates, but, once it does, I think it is reasonable to expect the equity markets to steady.” He said earnings and valuations would then probably determine the outlook for stocks.“For Wall Street, the price-earnings ratio is at the low end of the range for this bull market,” said Mr Lenhoff. “Even if earnings expectations are revised to reflect half the growth that is now expected over the next 12 months, we are still talking about a forward price earnings ratio of around 15 for the S&P 500.”Meanwhile, the dollar set a record low against the euro, and the dollar index was flirting with its record low set back in 1992. In general, equity investors have viewed the ongoing decline in the dollar this year as a boon for stocks that have international operations.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said: “A slow, steady decline in the dollar can help equities, but ultimately it will be inflationary for the economy and restrict the Fed’s ability to cut rates.“A weaker dollar will help large-cap and growth stocks at the relative expense of small companies and value.”On Wednesday, the S&P 100 index rose 0.1 per cent, while the Russell 2000 index of small companies lost 0.6 per cent.The Nasdaq 100 index of large technology companies has risen 13.2 per cent this year and leads the main US benchmarks by a healthy margin.Among big tech companies, Apple rose 1 per cent to $136.85 after UBS raised its price estimate to $182.Another asset market influencing stocks was oil. US crude futures rose to a record intra-day high of $80.18 a barrel after weekly stockpiles fell more than expected.In turn, energy stocks were firmer, with Exxon Mobil up 0.8 per cent at $87.65, but the transport sector was under pressure. The Dow Transports Average fell 0.8 per cent. The American stock exchange oil index was up 0.7 per cent at 1,397.13, shy of this year’s high 1,522.10 set in July.Texas Instruments was 1.7 per cent lower at $35.12. The mobile phone chip maker nudged third-quarter forecasts higher, but some of the upward guidance was derived from an asset sale, rather than operations.The S&P financials sector, which rallied 1.3 per cent on Tuesday, fell 0.2 per cent on Wednesday. Countrywide continued its decline and the mortgage lender lost 1.5 per cent to close at $16.62. This week, the stock has fallen 8.7 per cent amid concerns about its ability to access funding.Amgen rose 3.3 per cent at $55.64 after its anaemia treatment drug received a favourable ruling from the US Food and Drug Administration. Johnson & Johnson rose 0.7 per cent to $62.51."
228;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Short-range Bluetooth and CSR’s long reach;;Bluetooth is getting smarter, according to the British company that dominates the market for the short-range wireless chips.John Scarisbrick, chief executive of Cambridge Silicon Radio, produced as proof his Jawbone, made by San Francisco’s Aliph, on a visit to our office.The high-end mobile earpiece depends on CSR’s Bluetooth chip, but the Cambridge, UK company has also crammed digital signal processors and other features onto the silicon that improve voice quality and battery life.In Sony’s PlayStation 3 Bluetooth headsets, CSR has tweaked its software to eliminate any delay between something exploding on screen and players hearing the sound. The same low-latency derivative of Bluetooth will power headsets for portable media players to ensure accurate lip-syncing between video and audio.The Bluetooth standard itself has enjoyed several upgrades between the 1.0 and 2.1 version. 2.0 added the stereo capability and 2.1 eliminates the need for inputting a pin code to pair devices – instead, just putting the two in proximity to one another makes them assume a connection.Bog-standard Bluetooth chips now cost only $1 – $2, which is why CSR is trying to add value with extra processors and software. It is also expanding into Wireless USB chips and ultra low power Bluetooth, which could add features such as remote-control functions to phones.CSR has 60 per cent of the Bluetooth market, with its nearest rivals Broadcom and Texas Instruments of the US taking 20 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.Mr Scarisbrick’s visit to Silicon Valley to meet investors made him realise CSR was still only a small voice in America’s ear, but he was able to point out with some satisfaction that they were probably hearing about it through one of the 85 per cent of Bluetooth headsets that contain CSR’s chip.
229;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-08-08T21:58:07Z;Nokia to outsource chip development;;Nokia, the world’s largest maker of mobile phones, is to stop in-house development of semiconductors for most of its mobile phones and outsource the business to third parties.The Finland-based company said the move would free an undisclosed sum for research into more complex chips needed for its advanced multimedia, internet-enabled handsets.Nokia will use four chipset suppliers – Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics. Chipsets are combinations of integrated circuits that operate together.The Finnish company also said it would licence coveted modem technology for the first time, so generating additional revenue.The decision to broaden its range of chipset suppliers and licence proprietary technology for high-speed WCDMA/HSDPA mobile phone chips will be an opportunity for chip companies such as STMicroelectronics and Broadcom to enter a new market.Only Nokia, Ericsson Mobile Platforms and Qualcomm are believed to have the technology to make cost-effective WCDMA/HSDPA chips.“We will have more players in the industry who will be total solution providers,” said Niklas Savander, Nokia’s executive vice-president for technology platforms.On Wednesday, Nokia shares closed 4 per cent ahead at €22.48 in Helsinki. Broadcom rose 9.8 per cent to $35.98 by the close in New York and STMicroelectronics shares were little changed at $16.91. Infineon rose 2.7 per cent to €11.36.However, Texas Instruments fell 0.3 per cent to $33.73 and Qualcomm slipped 0.3 per cent to $40.15.Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura, said: “This is the most negative news for Qualcomm, which makes excellent margins in WCDMA chipsets.”He added that the company will now face much greater competition and pricing pressure in the long-term.”Nokia’s move to broaden its range of chip suppliers is also negative for Texas Instruments, which has been Nokia’s sole supplier of 3G and Edge semiconductors but will now have to compete with others.Nokia plans to transfer 200 staff to STMicro.
230;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-08-07T21:07:33Z;Court hits Qualcomm on abusive practice;;Qualcomm deliberately hid information from a technology standards body and failed to reveal thousands of relevant documents in a legal proceeding, a US court ruled on Tuesday.The finding by a federal court judge in San Diego is highly embarrassing for the US chip technology company as it faces a widening series of patent cases.The allegations of abusive practice also come at a delicate time for the US company in Europe, where a number of chip companies and wireless handset makers have accused it of using aggressive tactics to overcharge for its technology used in the W-CDMA high-speed wireless standard.Chipmakers Broadcom and Texas Instruments, as well as handset makers including Nokia and Ericsson, have accused it in Europe of trying to charge excessive fees on the W-CDMA standard.In a statement, Qualcomm said it “acknowledges the seriousness of the court’s findings and reiterates its previous apology to the court for the errors made during discovery and for the inaccurate testimony of certain of its witnesses”.But the company added it “respectfully disagrees” that it intended to mislead the standards body or the court. It also said it would appeal against the court’s decision to throw out two of its patents that were linked to the work of the standards body.“Qualcomm has over the years been accused of co-opting standards and using the technology to fill its pockets with royalties,” said Smith Brittingham, a lawyer at Finnegan Henderson. “This [ruling] puts those sorts of efforts at risk.”The ruling upheld a finding of misconduct against Qualcomm earlier this year. The judge concluded that Qualcomm had deliberately concealed two of its patents from the industry standards body. By not disclosing technology in this way, it could have been in a position to charge royalties for its intellectual property at a later stage, benefiting from the widespread adoption ensured by the standards process.The decision could well encourage other critics of the company to fight harder to resist its efforts to levy royalties for its technology in other standards, said Mr Brittingham.
231;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-07-26T03:50:51Z;Qualcomm undaunted by patent dispute;;Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker, reported record third-quarter earnings but said it would continue to be dogged by patent litigation.The San Diego-based company said quarterly revenues to July 1 rose 19 per cent year-on-year to $2.33bn, exceeding the analyst consensus of $2.26bn gathered by Reuters Estimates.Net income of $934m was up 29 per cent and pro-forma earnings per share of 55 cents beat analyst predictions of 51 cents. Qualcomm shares rose 3.6 per cent to $44 in extended trading in New York.Paul, Jacobs, chief executive, said it had been “another tremendous quarter” for the business, but Qualcomm had been unable to come to an agreement with rival chipmaker Broadcom in its principal patent dispute. Broadcom has won a ban from the International Trade Commission on the importation of new smartphones containing Qualcomm chips that the ITC judges to have infringed its patents. The Bush administration has until August 6 to decide whether to veto the ban.Mr Jacobs said Broadcom’s insistence on royalty-free rights for its customers to access important parts of Qualcomm’s patent portfolio was preventing any agreement. “Unfortunately, the next few months represent a crucial litigation timeframe and we can’t predict the outcome at present,” he said.Qualcomm gave a more optimistic forecast for its fiscal year, increasing its guidance on revenues from the range of $8.4bn-$8.7bn to $8.72bn-$8.82bn.The iSuppli research firm said on Monday that Texas Instruments was displaced by Qualcomm in the first quarter of this year as the number-one supplier of chips for mobile phones.
232;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-07-25T08:03:43Z;Hynix sets aim at doubling sales by 2010;;Hynix Semiconductor, the world’s fifth-largest chipmaker, outlined plans Wednesday to break into the top three by almost doubling sales to $18bn by 2010.The ambitious plan comes two days before Hynix is set to announce poor second-quarter results due to lower chip prices caused by a supply glut.”So far, we have focused on survival itself, but we will now switch into growth mode,” chief executive Kim Jong-kap told a news conference. ”We will achieve quality growth through aggressive investments.”The South Korean company plans to lift its research and development spending from 6 per cent of its revenue this year to 10 per cent by 2012 and increase its research workforce from 2,000 to 5,000. It plans to build three more 300mm fabs by 2010 to raise its overall sales from $8.3bn last year to $18bn.Hynix aims to become the world’s biggest semiconductor company by 2017 by achieving annual sales growth of 20 per cent. Hynix currently ranks fifth among semiconductor companies behind market leader Intel, Samsung Electronics, Toshiba and Texas Instruments, according to market researcher IC Insights.Hynix targets $25bn in 2012 sales and aims to raise its share in D-ram, Nand flash memory, and P-ram chips to 30 per cent each. To find new sources of growth, the company plans to enter the P-ram market by 2009 and resume production of CPU and other types of non-memory chips. P-ram chips are expected to become the main memory device replacing high-density flash memory chips within the next decade as they are faster and more energy efficient.Hynix plans to spend 30-40 per cent of its revenue for facility investments. It has earmarked Won4,400bn in 2007 capital expenditure after spending Won4,300bn last year. The company said it would continue to seek strategic alliances with its rivals to pursue joint development, cross-licensing, joint capital investment and other forms of cooperation.Analysts expect Hynix to report slight losses for the second quarter, after posting operating profits for the past 15 consecutive quarters. But its performance is likely to improve in the second half on a recovery in chip prices.Mr Kim said creditors who now control Hynix want to sell the company to domestic investors because of fears of technology leaks. He added that there are several potential local buyers interested in taking over the company as creditors seek to sell their 36 per cent stake gradually over the next year.
233;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-07-23T22:46:48Z;Texas Instruments sees bounce;;Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, has reported that second-quarter sales were 7 per cent higher than the previous period as its customers worked their way out of an inventory build-up.TI said demand had begun to rebound, increasing revenues from $3.19bn to $3.42bn. However, they were 7 per cent lower than a year earlier “due to lower demand across a broad base of products”. Its shares fell nearly 3.7 per cent to $36.77 in after-hours trading.TI also announced a strategic technology partnership with Ericsson to package TI’s application processors with Ericsson’s modems, appealing to manufacturers of high-end and mid-range third-generation phones.TI said the partnership will include making chips with Bluetooth, GPS and wi-fi capabilities. They will address smartphones using Linux, Symbian and Windows Mobile operating systems. The first handsets using the combined chips should appear in the second half of 2008.The Dallas-based company reported a record gross margin of 52.1 per cent, up from 51.6 per cent a year ago, and Rich Templeton, chief executive, said the goal in the next few years was to achieve a gross margin of 55 per cent.“We see even greater opportunities ahead as the market regains momentum,” he said.“With TI’s broad product portfolio, spanning both analogue and digital signal processing technologies, we are in a unique position to support customers working on hundreds of electronics applications across the globe.”TI’s chips, including semiconductors converting analogue sources to digital and back, are found in products from mobile phones to consumer electronics and industrial equipment, making it a bellwether for chip demand.It said orders were 8 per cent higher than the previous quarter at $3.45bn. Days of inventory were 78, down from 82 in the first quarter.Earnings per share were 42 cents, a 20 per cent increase on the prior quarter. TI forecast earnings per share of between 46 and 52 cents for the third quarter on revenues of $3.49bn to $3.79bn.

Merck said second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent, sending the Dow component 6.8 per cent higher to $52.33 at the close of trading in New York.Schering-Plough more than doubled its quarterly profit, but the stock fell back 0.6 per cent to $31.30 despite rising earlier in the session.Halliburton, the oil services firm, reported a 19 per cent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its share price up 3.2 per cent to $37.74.The steep rise came after the spin-off of its engineering firm KBR earlier this year.The Houston-based company earned $1.53bn, or $1.62 a share, up from $591m, or 55 cents a share, in the same period last year.In deals news, the oil drilling sector grabbed the spotlight as Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agreed to merge. The companies have a combined market capitalisation of $48bn. Transocean was up 5.5 per cent at $115.96, while GlobalSantaFe had jumped 4.8 per cent to $78.33 by the close. If the transaction goes through, it would create the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger.Many are betting that the world’s supply of cheap crude oil is running out and energy companies will be reliant on new and more expensive methods to produce and transport energy.Hewlett-Packard agreed to acquire Opsware in a deal worth $1.6bn, according to a company statement.The move, one among several recent business technology buy-outs by HP, is intended to help automate the company’s data centre.HP shares fell 0.2 per cent to $48.43 while Opsware shares soared 36.19 per cent to $14.00.Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity house, said it would buy United Rentals for $6.6bn, including debt. The stock was up 1.9 per cent at $32.98.But analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that financial stocks, and specifically brokerage stocks, continued to trade poorly. “Even after generally positive earnings news, investors want nothing to do with the group,” they said.Toymaker Hasbro also bucked the buoyant mood. Second-quarter profit fell 82 per cent, as a charge of $36.5m linked to warrants purchased from Lucasfilm outweighed the effect of a licensing deal for Spider-Man 3 toys and sales of Transformer toys. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.80.Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,541.52 at the close in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.1 per cent firmer at 2,690.58The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,943.42.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.58 per cent, to 841.25.“We still have a very positive supply demand ratio with a lot of money on the sidelines that wants in at the moment,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The fact is that investors are in a ‘glass half full’ mood and are generally prepared to look beyond problems such as the subprime mortgage market debacle and wider geopolitical risks.”He added that most agreed that the market continued to display largely sound fundamentals, describing the prevailing mood as one of cautious optimism rather than of irrational exuberance.In other news, VeraSun Energy agreed to pay $725m for three ethanol plants with annual production capacity of 300 million gallons a year. Shares were 4.9 per cent higher at $14.4.Shares of Tellabs rose 3 per cent to $12.20 after media reports that the communications equipment company is entertaining a $7bn takeover offer from Nokia Siemens Networks.Shares in Netflix, which was scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Monday, tumbled 12 per cent to $17.27 after the video rental company cut prices over the weekend on two of its subscription plans by $1.American Express and Texas Instruments were due to report their latest earnings after the closing bell in New York on Monday.The latest quarterly earnings from McDonald’s, AT&T, UPS and Amazon are due on Tuesday.Boeing and Apple results are due later this week.
235;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-06-12T20:30:23Z;Record bond yields sink Wall Street;;"Wall Street slumped on Tuesday, as the 10-year bond yield reached its highest level in five years, and cast a bearish pall over equities.Rate-sensitive stocks, such as utilities, real estate investment trusts, home builders and some financials were on the defensive.Bearish sentiment was also reflected in lower transport stocks and a further pullback in the steel sector.Stocks largely tracked the change in bond yields on Tuesday. When yields showed signs of stabilising during the early afternoon, stocks turned higher. But, late on Tuesday, when yields rose to fresh highs, that ultimately sank stocks.The S&P 500 index closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,492.99.Telecoms and utilities were the weakest main industry groups in the S&P.Concern has been growing among stock traders that higher yields would slow merger and acquisition activity as financing costs for deals increased. The past week has seen just $1.8bn in announced M&A deals, the lowest since November.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors relying on mergers and acquisitions to boost prices are likely on edge wondering whether the decline is a result of rising interest rates or summer
doldrums.”Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said: “Private equity could become more selective about new deals.”The rise in rates has also prompted investors to calculate whether equities still look attractive compared with fixed-income securities that now offer higher yields.Mr Wood said: “Fixed income has become more attractive, but stocks still look better. The prospect of stronger growth in the US has been behind the rise in yields.”David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “The stock/bond decision has become more finely balanced after the bond market shake-out.“Relative to bonds, equities offer reasonable but not compelling value.”Bond traders said the May retail sales report, due on Wednesday, and consumer prices data, released on Friday, would provide the market with some fundamental news to place the recent rise in yields in context.Mr Shairp said: “The equity pullback may have further to go, as markets come to terms with the carnage in the fixed-income markets and they have a chance to digest their gains since March.”On Tuesday, equity volatility rose. The Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index of S&P volatility gained 12.2 per cent to 16.50, but closed below last week’s peak of 17.09.Quarterly option contracts expire this week, and that could also spark sharp moves in the S&P index said analysts. Technology and blue chips both closed lower.A narrowing in second-quarter guidance from Texas Instruments, down 2.1 per cent at $35.04, hurt chip makers.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,549.77.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1 per cent at 13,295.01. Of the Dow’s 30 stocks, 27 closed lower on Tuesday, led by a 2.6 per cent fall in AT&T to $39.08. The Dow Transportation Average lost 1.9 per cent, and closed at its lowest level since mid April.A bright spot among blue chips was a 1.2 per cent rise to $22.20 in Intel as it bucked the sell-off in other chip-makers. McDonald’s up 0.45 per cent at $51.48, and Alcoa, up 0.1 per cent at $39.34 were the other Dow stocks to close higher.In earnings news, Lehman Brothers reported net income rose 27 per cent over the past year to a record $1.3bn. The stock rose 0.5 per cent to $76,06, and pared an earlier rise to $78.19. The stock remains 2.6 per cent lower for the year and set a high for the year of $85.80 in early February.The bank said its diversified operations helped offset a 14 per cent fall in its fixed income revenues, from bonds, derivatives and credit products, due to ”continued weakness in the US residential mortgage business.”Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, said that while it boosted home loans by 15 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, its foreclosure rate had doubled. Shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.10.Yahoo fell 1.1 per cent to $27.05 as its annual shareholder meeting was held.Starbucks rose 0.7 per cent to $27.74, rebounding from an earlier decline when Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “conviction buy” list.Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $13.47 after a brokerage upgrade.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained 2.1 per cent to $19.33 after JPMorgan upgraded the video game publisher to “outperform”.Dean Foods fell 4.3 per cent to $31.07 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter and the year because of higher milk prices.Shares in American Commercial Lines fell 9.1 per cent to $26.27 after the transportation company also cut its earnings outlook."
236;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-06-08T19:27:09Z;LG petitions US over Qualcomm;;LG, the South Korean handset maker, is asking the US courts to suspend a ban on imports of its high-end mobile phones that could damage its US business.LG is joining Qualcomm, the chipmaker, and telecoms operators AT&T and T-Mobile in petitioning the courts to suspend Thursday’s ruling by the US International Trade Commission to ban imports of third-generation mobile phones that contain chips by Qualcomm. The chips were deemed by the ITC to violate a patent held by rival Broadcom.LG relies heavily on the sale of Qualcomm-based phones into the North American market and is seen as one of the biggest losers from the ban. “The biggest hit will be on LG, which has the biggest exposure to the US CDMA market,” said Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura.Samsung, another key Qualcomm customer, is also likely to be hit. Motorola could also suffer as key future products, such as the new version of the Razr phone, are based on Qualcomm chips.US mobile phone operators Verizon Wireless, Sprint and AT&T will also be hard hit by the ban. Although the ban does not cover products currently on the market, it will stop the telecoms companies offering new high-end products to customers.The ban could, however, be a boost for Nokia and Sony Ericsson, whose mobile handsets do not use Qualcomm chips. Nokia has recently struggled in the US market, with sales of phones in the region falling 42.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2006.“This is definitely an opportunity that Nokia could use to its advantage,” said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight.Texas Instruments, whose chips compete with Qualcomm’s, could also see a pick-up in sales. Apple’s iPhone, which is due to be launched at the end of this month, also does not use the disputed chips, and could also benefit from Samsung and LG’s misfortune. High-end phones from the two Korean groups were seen as key competitors to the Apple phone, which could now enjoy a clearer run.The ITC order becomes final after 60 days, during which time it is reviewed by the Bush administration and can be vetoed by the president, although there are few precedents for this.
237;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-05-24T21:36:33Z;Nokia hits back in Qualcomm dispute;;Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, on Thursday stepped up its legal battle over the level of royalties it pays chipmaker Qualcomm, announcing its first patent countersuit.The move increased the pressure from all sides on Qualcomm, which is also in dispute with rival chipmaker Broadcom and the subject of complaints by Texas Instruments and Ericsson, among others.It faces a decision from the US International Trade Commission on Friday on whether to ban the import of a class of cellphones using its chips.In the latest round of a series of legal cases spread across Europe and the US, Nokia said it had responded to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in Wisconsin last month, saying it was confident its products did not infringe two Qualcomm patents mentioned in the suit and asserting that both were invalid.In addition, it filed its first patent counter assertions for alleged infringement of six Nokia patents used in chipsets for 3G phones. It said it was seeking damages and an injunction against Qualcomm’s chipsets.“Over the past 19 months, Qualcomm has filed 11 patent litigation cases against Nokia seeking damages and injunctions,” said Rick Simonson, chief financial officer. “Nokia has now filed its first counter action to address Qualcomm’s unauthorised use of Nokia technology.”At the heart of the dispute is the expiry of a cross-licensing agreement between the two groups this year and their failure to agree a new deal. Nokia has objected to renewing the agreement on the same terms, with Qualcomm continuing to earn royalties of about 4.5 per cent of the cost of handsets containing its chips.Analysts estimate Nokia will soon be paying Qualcomm more than $1bn a year at current royalty rates.In the ITC case, Broadcom has asked for a ban on imports of cellphones using Qualcomm chips that infringe Broadcom patents. The commission found that Qualcomm infringed on a battery-saving patent. Qualcomm has argued that a ban would hurt consumers and carriers who depend on Qualcomm’s technology.The argument has spread to carriers. Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless, which depend on Qualcomm’s chips, are supporting its arguments, but AT&T and Deutsche Telekom this week urged the ITC to avoid a compromise decision.Additional reporting by Robert Anderson in Stockholm
238;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-05-21T18:18:06Z;The Philippines;;The Philippines, the old joke went, is the country of the future – and always will be. Now, with the stock market at a 10-year high, a slew of equity offerings and an increasing number of investors boarding Manila-bound flights, the joke is looking a little dated.Sentiment has improved on several fronts. The economy is expected to grow by more than 6 per cent this year, bolstered by foreign businesses moving more of their operations to the country. Business process outsourcing is a $3.6bn industry that the local trade body expects to top $12bn in four years. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has pushed through sales tax increases so that the country – once Asia’s biggest borrower outside Japan – is no longer reliant on foreign debt. The political landscape appears stable. All this has impressed foreigners. This month, Texas Instruments of the US announced plans for a $1bn assembly test site, while Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is to plough $153m into a Manila hotel complex.Less wealthy investors have been piling in, too. Net foreign buying on the $160bn stock market rose 73 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of 2007. Real estate is on the up. Office prices rose 6 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the previous three months, according to Colliers International, slightly ahead of luxury condominiums. Given low vacancy rates, minimal new supply in the central business district and increasing rents (which are still at a 25 per cent discount to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur), there is scope for further appreciation. At the grittier end of the investment spectrum, there are opportunities in infrastructure and mining: the Philippines has extractable mineral wealth worth $840bn, or 10 times gross domestic product, says the government. Only a fraction of this is being tapped, reflecting past, botched liberalisation plans. Snags remain, including corruption. But the country no longer looks like a bad joke.
239;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-05-20T16:11:07Z;The Monday Interview: The appliance of financial science;;When Robert Merton invented the “Black-Scholes” formula back in the early 1970s, he never bothered to file a patent for the idea.For though the formula – created by the Nobel-prize-winning economist and two other academics – enabled the highly profitable world of derivatives to explode, “it never occurred to [us] not to put the Black-Scholes formula into the public domain”, recalls the professor of finance at Harvard University, with an impish grin that belies his 62 years.“We didn’t really look for commercial opportunities [in quite the same way],” he adds. Indeed, when Texas Instruments, the electronics group, subsequently launched a best-selling calculator that incorporated the model, it even refused to provide free samples to the academics.Three decades later, however, people such as Prof Merton are becoming more savvy about getting their just rewards – and on a bigger scale than free calculators. Since Mr Merton invented Black-Scholes, together with Myron Scholes and Fischer Black, he has come to be viewed as a founding figure of the modern financial world. Indeed, some bankers argue that the Black-Scholes theory, which provides an easy way to value options, has had as much impact on finance as the discovery of DNA has had on medicine.But aside from options theory, Prof Merton has also won academic acclaim by producing a host of other ideas, such as a model for predicting credit defaults that has become highly influential in the City and on Wall Street in the past decade. “Some of my ideas found their way into practice quickly and some only after a considerable lag,” Prof Merton notes.The son of Robert K. Merton, a prominent social scientist, he apparently displayed an interest in number crunching from a young age. According to Roger Lowenstein, the author of When Genius Failed, “the younger Merton . . . showed a knack for devising systematic approaches to whatever he tackled. A devotee of baseball and cars, he studiously memorised first the batting averages of players and then the engine specs of virtually every American automobile.”When he began studying economics at university, he would spend hours at brokerages watching how the markets moved. He transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1960s, just as the field of finance was gaining acceptance as a mathematical discipline.Alongside his academic work, he has also been seeking ways to translate his esoteric concepts into profitable practice. Not all of these endeavours have been a success: back in the late 1990s, Prof Merton became a partner in the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund, which controlled $100bn of assets before imploding in dramatic fashion (see right).However, after that shocking episode – which created losses for Prof Merton and the other partners – he created a financial consultancy, IFL, with Roberto Mendoza and Peter Hancock, two Wall Street luminaries who used to work at JPMorgan. And now this trio has upped its ambitions by linking up with another consultancy called Marakon.Their hope is that the merged entity, known as Trinsum, will allow IFL’s brainpower to reach a wider pool of clients in a more practical manner. “What we are basically doing . . . is taking all these ideas from finance science that have been already proven in the financial markets and then apply them strategically to companies, to whole firm risk, and even country risk,” he explains.In practical terms, this means IFL is now promoting some radical ideas about how companies should manage their finances. Until now, Prof Merton argues, most companies have been extraordinarily inefficient in their use of capital, because they have not worked out which risks they have a comparative advantage in handling – and which they do not. Managers have wasted capital by inadvertently assuming risks they are ill-suited to hold, such as property exposure (via real estate assets) or markets (through pension holdings).However, if companies would only shed that risk, or outsource the management of it, they would have more capital to support growth, Prof Merton argues. And one of the best ways to do this, he concludes, is to use derivatives. “The major advantages of using derivatives are that they are efficient in transferring huge amounts of risk. They can be customised, and policies implemented with them [are] reversible and non invasive,” he enthuses.Such sentiments might horrify some corporate executives. Ever since Wall Street suffered a series of derivatives scandals in the 1990s, the “D” word has been viewed with deep distrust in many business quarters. And Prof Merton’s evangelical zeal for the product might seem particularly controversial after the media blamed derivatives in part for the implosion at LTCM.But Prof Merton insists that derivatives have been grossly misunderstood: if things go wrong, it should not be blamed on these instruments per se, but on the way they are used. And he insists it is entirely possible – desirable, in fact – for institutions to use them for benign purposes that reduce exposure to risk. “Asking whether the world today wants to use derivatives or not is a bit of a meaningless question – it is like asking whether we want to use cars. They are an integral part of the financial system,” he says.“Derivatives are like anti-lock brake systems in a way – there is no question that they can make things safer, but only if people choose to use them that way. Often they don’t – they might choose, for example, to drive faster in worse weather. Often we have chosen to use these tools not to decrease risks but to increase the benefits of taking the same risks.”Will business leaders succumb to these ideas? Marakon’s strong franchise among blue-chip clients and IFL’s Nobel-prize-winning name should help open doors. And Prof Merton, Mr Hancock and Mr Mendoza have already made a striking convert to their cause.In the past year IFL has been designing a new pensions system for Philips, the electronics group. It uses derivatives to customise an individual’s long-term investments – fine-tuning them to whatever level of pay-outs, contributions and risk profile he or she prefers.The scheme, which is neither a standard defined contribution system nor a defined benefit plan, has been adopted by Philips’ top 400 executives in Europe and will be rolled out across the European operations this year. However, Prof Merton hopes it can then spread to other companies. And behind the scenes he and his colleagues are now drawing up other schemes to help companies manage capital or fight off the private equity threat.“[Applying finance science to companies] is a fascinating intellectual challenge,” enthuses Prof Merton. “But it is obviously also a commercial opportunity.”Putting panic in perspective: LTCM as a learning experienceThe spectacular implosion of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 has come to symbolise the perils of excessive speculation.The causes of the hedge fund’s collapse, though, are widely misunderstood, says Robert Merton. While some observers blamed events on the faith that the fund placed in financial models – founded on a belief in rational markets – Prof Merton says the real problem was the way that LTCM’s counterparties behaved.When the $100bn fund started to suffer losses, the counterparties did not behave as proponents of finance science – or rational markets – predicted. Instead, they sold assets in a seemingly indiscriminate panic, triggering market swings more violent than anything Merton had expected.In that respect, the events were thus a brutal learning experience – not just for Prof Merton but Wall Street too. But that may also be a boon. “The real story is not what happened to LTCM in 1998 but what happened to Amaranth later – or rather, what didn’t happen,” Prof Merton says.“Just think about all the crises that haven’t happened, say with the downgrade of General Motors and Ford or the collapse of Amaranth. Look at how much more resilient the system is now – how institutions have adjusted and we have learnt to deal with some of these crises which are not really crises any more as a result.”
240;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-05-09T21:38:13Z;Wall St rises as no change in Fed policy;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signalled no change in its policy stance and outlook.The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady yet still flag up concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks. But the market quickly recovered and closed significantly stronger than where they had been before the Fed’s announcement.“The Fed did not scare the market by sounding hawkish on inflation,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “Based on current expectations, a rate cut is still likely by the end of the year, and that’s positive for stocks.”Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, said: “A rate cut is coming, but the Fed is biding its time and waiting for a clear peak in inflation.”At late afternoon, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,5012.58, led by gains in telecom, industrial and financial stocks. The index is nearing its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46.A big talking point among investors on Wednesday was Cisco as it shares slid 6.5 per cent to $26.51. The computer network operator’s fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from the same period last year, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance.“Of the 12 times the stock has opened lower on earnings since 2002, it has gone up from the open just once,” according to the Bespoke Investment Group.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite for much of on Wednesday, but the tech heavy benchmark pared losses after the FOMC meeting and closed up 0.2 per cent at at 2,576.34.Texas Instruments rose 4.7 per cent to $36.83, after the maker of phone chips raised its profit margin targets on expectations for strong revenue growth.Blue-chips benefited from the FOMC outcome and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to a new record close of 13,362.87. Honeywell, up 1.8 per cent at $56.81, and Caterpillar, up 1.8 per cent at $74.75, boosted the Dow.IBM also boosted blue chips after Goldman Sachs upgraded “Big Blue” to a “buy” from “neutral” amid the company’s plans to repurchase stock and cut costs.That reversed Goldmans’ downgrade made last week. IBM shares closed up 1.1 per cent at $104.38, after setting a 52-week high of $104.75 earlier in the morning.A drag on the Dow was Walt Disney after it reported second quarter profit rose 27 per cent, but quarterly revenue was less than expected. Shares fell 1.2 per cent to $36.12, after the stock set a six-year high of $36.57 on Tuesday.Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.Mr Skrainka said “the market is still at a fair level relative to earnings,” and investors were encouraged that corporate earnings had advanced near a double-digit pace in spite of a much slower economy during the first quarter.Mr Ablin said other factors continued to support stock prices. “More than 200 companies in the S&P 500 sport a free cash flow yield in excess of the 10-year Treasury note, suggesting that the environment remains ripe for more buyouts and buybacks.”The housing market remains one of the economy’s weak spots, highlighted on Wednesday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 0.55 per cent to $29.05.In other earnings news, News Corp reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting analysts’ estimates. The media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a $5bn bid for Dow Jones last week, but has been rebuffed by the Bancroft family which controls the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. News Corp was 1.65 per cent lower at $23.26 at mid-afternoon.One of the biggest movers on Wednesday was drugmaker Dendreon. The stock plunged 64.3 per cent to $6.33 after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, a speciality drugmaker, slid 11.3 per cent to $15.97, after the FDA sought details about its experimental drug to treat smoking and gambling addiction.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 3.3 per cent to $10.24 after the drugmaker agreed to develop and market a cholesterol drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb.Shares in Electronic Arts fell 4.3 per cent to $50.65 after the video game maker reported a larger-than-forecast fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
241;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-05-03T16:24:03Z;Manila wins US phone chip plant;;The Philippines has won a $1bn investment from Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest maker of mobile phone chips, in a boost to the country’s efforts to attract fresh foreign direct investment.Manila has struggled to attract significant FDI in recent years amid the widespread perception the Philippines is plagued by corruption and regulatory risks. Transparency International recently ranked the country the most corrupt in Asia.China and Vietnam have drawn the lion’s share of investment in recent years from foreign investors looking to establish low-cost manufacturing plants.FDI into the Philippines has averaged $1.6bn annually in the past three years, one of the lowest in south-east Asia, and President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo says she wants to double this by the end of her term in 2010.Texas said on Thursday it planned to build a $1bn (€736m, £502m) assembly and testing facility. It would be the chip industry’s single biggest investment in the Philippines and Texas’s first big investment there for 30 years.Dennis Posadas, a former Intel engineer and author of a book on technology entrepreneurship in Asia, said: “The Philippines is again on the radar screen of big semiconductor multinational companies.”The country could play a complementary role to cheaper producers such as China or Vietnam. “The global chipmakers are unlikely to keep all their eggs in just one basket,” he said, recalling how the Taiwan earthquake caused a temporary shortage in chips in the US.Registered investments by semiconductor companies, which account for up to two-thirds of Philippine exports, fell from a peak of $1bn in 2001 to $443m in 2004 as companies expanded or transferred production elsewhere.Toshiba, which made 2m computers a year in the Philippines, moved production abroad in 2005. Industry leaders have complained of poor roads and power costs that are the highest in Asia outside Japan.Texas considered three other countries for the plant – China, Vietnam and Thailand, according to Kevin Ritchie, senior vice-president at the company.Ernesto Santiago, executive director of the semiconductor industry association, said TI’s announcement showed the Philippines, which has a large English-speaking workforce, was an attractive site although wages and power costs were higher than China’s.
242;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-04-27T20:37:03Z;Wall St steadier following GDP jitters;;A fresh batch of strong earnings updates pushed Wall Street stocks to historic highs this week, but the advance remained more symbolic than substantial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 13,000 point threshold for the first time on Wednesday, in a move heralded by bulls as a sign of good times ahead.Yet the technical breakthrough came amid a listless week for the broader S&P 500 index. The benchmark index closed 0.7 per cent higher this week after falling slightly on four out of five days. The Dow rose 1.2 per cent this week.The Dow closed 0.1 per cent up on Friday at 13,120.94 while the S&P 500 was 0.2 points lower at 1,494.08.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,557.21.“It has been a week where the Dow has caught up with the S&P, they are now both up over 5 per cent for the year to date,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co.“The market has been celebrating earnings and upbeat guidance.”The indices were led upwards by companies such as Whirlpool and 3M that were boosted by a weak dollar and strong growth overseas. Railway and steel stocks, which are more exposed to the US economy, fared less well.Microsoft broke through the $30 mark for the first time since the launch of the Vista operating system to stand up 3.5 per cent to $30.12 on Friday. But overall investor sentiment was subdued by data showing economic growth slowing.This came towards the end of one of the best months on Wall Street for more than three years. The Dow rose 6.2 per cent in April, but the gains were driven by a relatively narrow base. About half of the gains were made by just eight of the 30 Dow component stocks.The steady rise in stocks has made it a testing month for short-sellers. Amazon, for instance, rose 36.9 per cent to $61.50 this week after entering April with short selling of its stock at the highest level since 2003.While the surge was sparked by a strong earnings report, the jump was partly explained by the unwinding of loss-making short positions.With more than two-thirds of the company’s shares held by a handful of investors, many short sellers looking to buy the stock may have found it hard to come by.Baker Hughes, the oil services group, was one of the biggest risers this week, up 11.7 per cent to $81.01.Like many other US groups reporting during the week, Baker was boosted by strong overseas sales. Whirlpool rose 17.6 per cent to $106.41 in spite of a US housing downturn because of strong appliance sales abroad.Meanwhile 3M, the Post-it Note maker that generates the majority of its revenues overseas, rose 4.9 per cent to $81.55 on strong profits.Railways and steel, two sectors that surged this year amid a burst of takeover speculation, began to lose some of their shine.The S&P Rail index, which is up 19.9 per cent this year, fell 3.5 per cent this week amid signs of weak traffic volume. CSX fell 2.9 per cent to $43.74.Profit updates from a number of steel groups undermined hopes that the steel cycle was on the up. US Steel slipped 3.6 per cent to $103.04 while Nucor fell 4.1 per cent to $64.94.Apple surged 9.8 per cent to $98.92 after handily beating analysts’ profit estimates as sales of Macintosh computers rose strongly.Texas Instruments gave upbeat guidance on chip demand, sending its stock up 7.2 per cent this week to $34.83. But relatively positive sentiment towards the sector began to wane on Friday.Broadcom plunged 4.2 per cent to $33.40 on Friday after the chipmaker fell short of analysts’ sales forecasts.JetBlue Airways slipped 3.6 per cent to $10 after JPMorgan described the group as “the most expensive airline money can buy” as it cut its rating on the company from “neutral” to “underweight”.JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on a total of six airlines, including US Airways and Continental, citing concerns about over-supply and weaker demand.Pressure on General Electric to pare its operations increased on Friday after Citigroup advocated selling the conglomerate’s NBC Universal media division.Jeffrey Sprague, a Citigroup analyst, said the group “needs to be more focused” and should sell NBC because it had “no meaningful synergy with the rest of the portfolio”.Shares in GE, down 1 per cent this year, rose 2.8 per cent to $36.84 on Friday.
243;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-04-24T20:49:48Z;IBM gains boost Dow;;"Wall Street stocks held within tight margins on Tuesday after a string of solid earnings reports helped soothe concerns about weak home sales.The disappointing housing data, coupled with soft consumer confidence figures, soured the mood in morning trading by increasing concerns about the wider economy. Shares in homebuilders and retailers fell sharply.By midday, however, the main market indices had recovered, led by technology stocks. The relatively measured market reaction to the downbeat economic news encouraged some analysts.“I’m impressed that the market has held up even though the magnitude of the decline [in home sales] was pretty large,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.“I’m not a fan of weather-related excuses but in this case people are holding out to see the pattern over a longer period.”The S&P 500 index closed flat at 1,480.44. Boosted by gains IBM, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent at 12,953.94.Meanwhile, the technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 0.03 per cent to 2,524.54.Most companies reporting on Tuesday beat profit estimates and raised their earnings guidance, according to Bloomberg data.“There has been more good earnings news than bad,” said Mr Hogan. “The guidance in particular is catching us by surprise.”The technology sector showed patches of strength.Texas Instruments jumped 7.7 per cent to $34.92 after the group overcame a glut of inventory to beat profit forecasts. In one of the first optimistic sets of remarks about demand for microchips this year, the group added that it expected better sales ahead.Piper Jaffray upgraded its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”, citing improved margins and a better product mix.The guidance lifted other chipmakers, including Nat­ional Semiconductor, which rose 4.3 per cent to $26.91. Meanwhile, SanDisk, the flash-memory maker, rose 4 per cent to $43.54.Some analysts remained guarded. “We caution investors from getting too bullish on the overall semiconductor cycle,” said Credit Suisse in a note to clients.“Demand and supply-chain dynamics continue to point to a muted recovery.”The Dow was led up by IBM, which gained 3.5 per cent to $98.49 after the computer services group raised its dividend and said it was buying back $15bn of its stock.AT&T reported a doubling of first-quarter profits to $2.8bn, beating estimates in its first full quarter since the company bought BellSouth. But its shares slipped 1.7 per cent to $39.10 after the number of its new subscribers disappointed.Housebuilders’ stocks fell after data showed the biggest year-on-year fall in existing home sales for 18 years. DR Horton pared early losses to stand 0.3 per cent lower at $22.53.The S&P Homebuilders index, which approached its lowest level in almost three years earlier this month, has dropped 16.6 per cent
this year. Retail groups were also under pressure after Target, the discount chain, said its sales were much weaker than expected in April.Its shares slid 1.8 per cent to $60.33. Rival Wal-Mart fell 0.5 per cent to $48.69.Steel stocks suffered after downbeat guidance from US Steel defied hopes that industry sales would imp-rove in the second quarter. US Steel slid 3.7 per cent to $103.04, while Nucor slipped 2.7 per cent to $66.71.AK Steel bucked the trend, rising 4.2 per cent to $30.99, after it reported a 10-fold jump in profits.IPSCO, which is in talks that could lead to the sale of the company, slipped 0.5 per cent to $151.48 after its earnings disappointed analysts.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Evraz, the Russian steelmaker."
244;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-03-13T22:50:51Z;Qualcomm raises forecasts amid handset growth;;Qualcomm, the number two maker of chips for mobile phones, on Tuesday raised second-quarter revenue and profit expectations – a sign it could be gaining ground on market leader Texas Instruments.Qualcomm said it expected revenues of $2.1bn to $2.2bn, up from estimates of $2.0bn to $2.1bn for the quarter ending April 1, and earnings per share of 48 to 49 cents. Previously it expected 42 to 44 cents.The San Diego-based company said its figures were based on the shipment of 60m to 61m Mobile Station Modem chips for phones, compared with its previous estimate of 55 to 57m units.Qualcomm shares closed up 4.25 per cent in New York at $41.83. Texas Instrument shares fell 2.61 per cent at $31.74.TI updated its first-quarter outlook on Monday by narrowing the range of its forecasts and trimming the top end. It predicted revenues of $3.07bn to $3.22bn, compared with the previous range of $3.01bn to $3.28bn. Profits per share of 29 to 33 cents were narrowed from earlier forecasts of 28 to 34 cents.The numbers disappointed investors, but Merrill Lynch analysts said the news represented a buying opportunity ahead of an industry upturn.Joe Osha, semiconductor analyst, predicted back-to-back sequential growth of 10 per cent or more over the next two quarters for TI.He said concerns about possible market share losses would not be a factor this year. Nokia, TI’s main customer, has been looking to diversify its supplier base, but TI has been diversifying its customer base, most notably with Motorola.Qualcomm has pioneered the CDMA mobile phone standard that has competed with the GSM standard in second-generation phones and is becoming dominant with 3G handsets. It said royalties being paid in its second quarter for CDMA licences suggested 91m CDMA phones shipped in the last quarter at an average selling price of $214, compared with estimates of 82m to 86m units at $217.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, said Qualcomm’s estimates reflected strong growth in chipsets and handsets as operators deployed 3G WCDMA and CDMA2000 mobile broadband around the world.
245;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-03-13T21:36:30Z;US indices down 2% on subprime fears;;The tentative gains made by Wall Street last week were rapidly erased on Tuesday as fears about subprime mortgage lending sparked a broad sell-off in stocks.After a shaky start provoked by a stronger yen and weak US retail sales data, stocks tumbled at midday on the release of data showing slightly higher-than-expected mortgage delinquency rates.This prompted nervous investors to sell shares in investment banks in spite of strong results from Goldman Sachs that showed a 29 per cent rise in first quarter profits. The alarm spread to drag down every sector.The Vix Index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped 29.6 per cent to 18.13.Financial groups led the way down. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, which are active in the mortgage market, plunged 5.9 and 6.7 per cent respectively to $72 and $142.97. The S&P investment banking and brokerage index closed 4.2 per cent down. Even Goldman slipped 1.8 per cent to $199.03.“The subprime situation came into a market that is cruising for a bruising – subprime just greases the slide,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent weaker at 1,377.95, less than 4 points off its low for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent lower at 12,075.96.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2 per cent to 2,350.57.The sell-off in subprime lenders continued without relent. The New York Stock Exchange moved to delist New Century Financial, and the lender said it had been asked to provide material for criminal investigations into the group.Another subprime player, Accredited Home Lenders, slumped 65 per cent to $3.98 after it said it needed to raise more money and was examining its strategic options.Shares in Countrywide, the big prime and subprime mortgage lender, were 4.7 per cent off at $33.49. The company said it would no longer make subprime loans that required no deposit or proof of income.Homebuilders suffered too, with Pulte Homes falling 5.1 per cent to stand at $25.99.Investors were wary of retail stocks after the release of weaker-than-expected sales figures for February. The S&P Retail index was 2.5 per cent down. Shares in Wal-Mart fell 2.3 per cent to $46.18 and Target fell 2.8 per cent to $60.47.Texas Instruments, the maker of chips for mobile phones, said on Monday that profits would fall short of the top end of its previous forecast. Texas shares initially fell sharply, but recovered some losses to stand 2.6 per cent down at $31.74.In deal news, Citigroup raised its tender offer for Nikko Cordial, Japan’s third-largest broker, by 26 per cent in a move that will raise the price of buying the group to Y1,578bn.Citigroup stock slipped 3.2 per cent to $48.75.
246;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-03-06T22:01:22Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;"Wall Street stocks on Tuesday made their biggest one-day gains since July as a rebound in overseas equities and a weaker yen lifted spirits.After a torrid week for equities, almost all sectors advanced, led by some of the financial, materials and technology stocks that have particularly suffered of late.The tentative recovery came in spite of moderately disappointing economic data that showed a higher-than-expected rise in labour costs and lower-than-expected pending home sales and factory orders.“The market was deeply oversold in a bloody week that quickly changed from greed to fear. We are well overdue for at least a knee-jerk bounce,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite surged 1.9 per cent to close at 2,385.14, lifted by Cisco and Google.The S&P 500 Index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,395.41 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent higher at 12,170.34. The rally recovered Monday’s losses in the biggest one-day percentage rise in the S&P and Dow for more than six months.Investment banks and brokerages improved after a bad week as fears about the financial markets began to ease. Bear Stearns was 3.1 per cent higher at $149 while Lehman Brothers leapt 4.4 per cent higher to $74.23.Shares in mortgage lenders also experienced a bounce after Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, said the subprime mortgage problems were contained.Countrywide was 4.7 per cent stronger at $36.85 while subprime lender New Century Financial gained 10.1 per cent to $5.02 after losing almost two-thirds of its market value on Monday.Real estate investment trusts were on the march, with the MSCI Reit Index up 3.5 per cent while shares in the Simon Property Group rose 4.7 per cent to $109.07.Analysts at Bear Stearns raised their rating on Texas Instruments to “outperform”, lifting its shares
1.5 per cent to $31.35. Texas was one of a number of technology groups that showed strength.Google and Apple rose 3.7 and 2.2 per cent respectively to $457.55 and $88.19 on signs that the two companies were working together more closely. Cisco rose 2 per cent to $25.96.Rising commodity prices helped materials stocks recoup some losses, with the aluminium group Alcoa up 2.1 per cent to $32.41 and US Steel rising 3.2 per cent to $87.67.Altria made gains after analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded the group from “hold” to “buy”, arguing it was undervalued. Its shares rose 2.7 per cent to $84.42.Sentiment was given an additional boost by merger and acquisition activity, such as Citigroup’s $10.75bn bid for Nikko Cordial, Japan’s third-largest brokerage. Citigroup’s stock gained 2.7 per cent at $50.58."
247;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-02-13T18:08:29Z;Its all about emerging markets;;"The theme of this year’s 3GSM World Congress was summarised by Naguib Sawiris, chairman and chief executive of Orascom, the Egyptian mobile phone operator, at the first keynote session of the conference.""This is the time of the emerging markets to come back. Just look at us. We have two Indians and an Egyptian on stage,"" he said.Indeed, a packed auditorium of telecoms executives were hanging on the every word of a powerful ""emerging markets"" trio of Arun Sarin, chief executive of Vodafone, Sanjiv Ahuja, chief executive of Orange and Mr Sawiris, whose Orascom has a strong grip not only in the Middle East but recently acquired operators in Italy and Greece as well.Mr Sarin was looking triumphant after clinching a deal earlier this week to buy Hutchison Essar, the fourth largest mobile operator in India.Mr Sarin was waxing lyrical about the possibilities of India, where mobile penetration of just 13 per cent today is expected to rise to 40 per cent within the next few years, creating a potential subscriber base of around 550m people.Also on the panel was Sanjiv Ahuja, chief executive of Orange, who, while not embarking on the same kinds of foreign adventures as Vodafone, spoke of Orange’s recently launched operations in Senegal.Europe is now a slow-growing market. Figures out on Tuesday from GfK, the research company, showed that Europe now had 210m mobile phone users, but numbers had only grown 5 per cent in 2006. Naturally emerging markets are more exciting.A number of announcements at 3GSM have been for products targeted at these markets. Texas Instruments is creating lower-cost chips for the market, and Motorola’s chief technology officer, Padmasree Warrior, told the Financial Times that the company was targeting developing countries with a number of products, such as solar-powered base stations suited to inaccessible areas and a new ultra-low cost phone designed to bring people who had never before made a mobile phone call into the wireless world.But the developing markets can be as brutal as they are tempting. Motorola had a poor fourth quarter, partly due to being hit by price competition in emerging markets. Motorola’s Ms Warrior, believes the land grab is temporary phenomenon, and that eventually sleek designs – such as the z8 slider phone the company launched yesterday – will begin to move up price points. There is no guidance, however, on when this will happen.A number of announcements at 3GSM have been for products targeted at these markets.

248;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-02-12T19:47:52Z;Talk – and everything else to do with phones – is getting cheaper;;Price cuts were a key theme on the first day of the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona.Nokia, the word’s largest handset producers, launched a TV-enabled mobile handset at a mid-market price, a move it hopes will stimulate growth of the mobile TV sector. At around €370 before tax and operator subsidy, compared with €600 for Nokia’s previous N92 TV-phone, it is priced for the mass market.Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive of Nokia, said the mobile TV market would start to build rapidly, with 5m to 10m units sold globally in 2008, growing to 20m in 2009.LG unveiled a cut-price 3G phone, winner of the GSM Associations competition to find cheaper high-speed phone technology. The handset will be available from the second quarter, and is expected to be around $100, 30 per cent cheaper than the current entry-level 3G phones.Texas Instruments, one of the world’s largest suppliers of mobile phone microchips, was also pushing a message of affordability. Rich Templeton said the company was developing cheaper chips that would make high-end entertainment phones more affordable for consumers in emerging markets.Mobile phone operators such as Nokia have recently focused on selling more basic models of phone into emerging markets like Indian and China. Nokia, for example, low-cost phones accounted for over 40 per cent of sales in 2006, compared with 23 per cent in 2005.Texas Instruments has suffered. Not only do these lower-spec phones need fewer chips, but it has been designed out at the very low end, with Nokia recently sourcing chips for this segment from Infineon. Texas Instruments appears to have no choice but to fight back on price.On the same theme was the announcement from O2 UK, part of Spain’s Telefonica, which abolished charges for receiving calls while abroad in 31 countries. Charges for receiving work calls while off on holiday have always seemed like insult added to injury and its good to see them go. Charges for calling back home to the UK while abroad were also cut to 25p a minute, a price O2 claims is 70 per cent lower than standard rates.The rate cuts are not just altruism, however. O2, like other UK operators is under pressure from the European Commission to lower the fees they charge for connecting to other networks abroad. Last November the Commission criticised the UK telecoms and media watchdog Ofcom for not cracking down on the pricing.
249;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-29T23:23:57Z;Intel’s tinier steps outpace rivals;;Analysts appear underwhelmed by Intel and IBM’s simultaneous announcements of the biggest chip breakthrough in 40 years.Joe Osha at Merrill Lynch says Intel and others have been talking about using high-k dialectric materials in next-generation 45-nanometre technology for years, so the accomplishment is no surprise.What is more interesting, he argues, is how many companies are likely to stay in this race to build smaller-scale chips as the technology becomes more challenging in the move from 45nm to 32nm and beyond.He has a point. Texas Instruments announced last week in its earnings report that it would be pooling its resources with its Asian foundry partners in future research. IBM has also developed research partnerships with Toshiba, Sony and AMD.Intel seems intent on ploughing a lone furrow. This is giving it a manufacturing lead at present – it will be first to market with 45nm chips, beating AMD by perhaps a year.The question is whether this will translate into market-share gains. Its lead in the current 65nm generation suggests it might, with the cheaper manufacturing process making it better able to compete in a price war with AMD.
250;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"
251;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
252;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-23T21:56:48Z;Wall Street edges up amid earnings;;US stocks posted modest gains on Tuesday as the latest flurry of earnings attracted buying after recent weakness in the market.In spite of the better tone, investors are mindful that upside earnings surprises have not matched the pace of recent quarters and that guidance for the current quarter looks soft.That could leave the market looking vulnerable, according to analysts.“We are in for a period of choppy trading,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “There will be an opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper levels in the near term.”Leading the recovery on Tuesday was the Russell 2000 index, but its gain of 0.9 per cent still left the market for small capitalised stocks in negative territory for the year.In New York, the S&P 500 closed up 0.35 per cent at 1,427.99. Higher oil prices boosted the energy sector by 2.4 per cent while healthcare stocks were off 0.4 per cent.Healthcare has this year been one of the better performing sectors in the S&P, with analysts suggesting that investors had sought refuge in defensive companies amid worries about the economy and profits.Earnings reports continued to arrive on Tuesday and homebuilders were in the spotlight. Shares in DR Horton jumped 4.6 per cent to $28.37 after it unveiled better than expected results and Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy”. The S&P homebuilders index rallied 2.2 per cent and Toll Brothers was up 4.1 per cent at $33.64.Technology shares rallied early in the day and then erased much of their gains. The Nasdaq Composite settled a touch higher at 2,431.41.Boosting the chipmaking sector was Texas Instruments, up 3.5 per cent at $29.60. The company’s earnings were better than expected and sentiment was helped by an upgrade from Merrill Lynch.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45 per cent to 12,533.80, helped by a 3.2 per cent rise to $66.14 in United Technologies.The company reported a 38 per cent rise in profits and re-affirmed its outlook for this year.Shares in Exxon Mobil rose 2.2 per cent to $74.49.Blue chips were held back by Pfizer, which fell 2.2 per cent to $26.37 after the stock was downgraded by Bear Stearns. Pfizer lost 1 per cent on Monday after its fourth quarter earnings fell.Johnson & Johnson shares lost 1 per cent to $66.50 in spite of beating earnings estimates.DuPont fell 0.9 per cent to $49.67 after the company met earnings expectations.Shares in Xerox fell 1 per cent to $16.53 after its fourth-quarter profit slid amid a restructuring charge.Gap shares fell 3.2 per cent to $19.26 after the company said on Monday that Paul Pressler would step down as president and chief executive.
253;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;TI to restructure R&D operations;;Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, announced a restructuring of its operations on Monday as it struggled with weak demand and growth focused on low-end handsets rather than higher priced “smart” phones.TI said it would save around $200m a year by working collaboratively with its foundry partners on next-generation manufacturing processes rather than creating its own core technology.This would cut its research and development budget and increase its responsiveness to customers, it said. An older digital factory would also be closed and its equipment moved to analogue factories. There would be 500 jobs cut by the year-end, with restructuring charges of $55m spread across the year.TI said it suffered “unseasonably weak” demand in the fourth quarter with revenues of $3.46bn down 8 per cent on the third quarter. It said it had limited production to reduce inventories.Earnings per share of 45 cents included a 5 cents benefit from a research tax credit. Without this, they were at the top end of its December forecast of earnings of 37 to 40 cents a share.“Challenges continue in the first quarter as we operate in an environment where customers want lower levels of inventory and where growth in the wireless market is skewed to low-priced, basic-featured cell phones instead of higher-priced, full-featured phones,” said Rich Templeton, chief executive.TI predicted sales of $3.01bn to $3.28bn in the first quarter – below analyst expectations of $3.32bn.
254;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-15T20:23:15Z;Technology profit warnings;;Technology companies have a proud tradition of keeping investors on their toes. Should a smattering of warnings in the run-up to the earnings season cause broader alarm in the sector?Not yet. In recent weeks, Motorola, SAP, AMD have all indicated that results would fall short of expectations. But the misses so far can be explained largely by company or sector specific issues and do not necessarily foreshadow broad-based technology weakness.Take Motorola. It has suffered mostly from pricing weakness in its mobile phone division. Not only are prices for its leading Razr phone under pressure but there is a general problem when it comes to persuading consumers to buy top-end phones, particularly in less developed markets. That is affecting companies from Nokia to Samsung. It also has a knock-on effect on chipmakers. Texas Instruments, for example, has said that it will be hit by consumers buying lower-end models, which requires less expenditure on chips.AMD’s problems appear more company-specific. Last year it stung Intel into action by taking market share and causing serious damage to its larger rival’s margins. As Intel now takes advantage of a stronger product pipeline and forces down prices in some of AMD’s core markets, the upstart microprocessor company is suffering. Intel, on the other hand, is set for a rebound because its sales and margins were hit so hard by AMD’s incursions last year.SAP and Oracle, meanwhile, have released weak new licence sales figures in recent months. That does not necessarily prefigure problems elsewhere in the software sector, given the lumpiness of their business and cut-throat rivalry. But, with SAP referring to weakness in the US market, investors should keep their eyes open for more signs that US technology demand is slowing.
255;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-07T20:05:56Z;Company man takes the stage;;As the Consumer Electronics Show opens in Las Vegas on Monday, one chief executive can make a safe bet the components his company makes feature inside more of the products on display than any other’s.Texas Instruments is the world’s third largest semiconductor company by revenue after Intel and Samsung, but Rich Templeton says it probably leads both in its reach across every industry represented at the US’s largest trade show – from consumer electronics to computers, mobile phones and the auto industry.“I think the leadership standard that might be more important, although you can’t measure it, is whether you are touching more customers – are you most important to the largest number of customers?”In the chief executive’s view, TI is number one in those terms. It is the biggest supplier of chips to mobile phone makers, while its business converting analogue pictures and sounds into digital signals has 50,000 customers.“Find me a company that’s in the design and manufacturing of electronic equipment and I’ll guarantee they buy at least one analogue component, which means I have a chance to sell a component to every single electronic manufacturing company in the world,” he says.The 48-year-old first joined TI as a salesman in 1980 after earning a degree in electrical engineering from Union College in New York, his home state, where IBM has its headquarters and his father worked as a manager. He has been based in Texas ever since – TI has its headquarters in Dallas and he lives there with his wife and three teenage children.While the semiconductor industry is notorious for executives jumping from one company to another, Mr Templeton is an example of how Texas Instruments has bred an IBM-style company man who stays loyal throughout his career.“I don’t know if it’s in my background – some of it is obviously, with the time that my father was at IBM – but I think in the senior management team you will see the same profile,” he says. “We take people from college, give them plenty of responsibility early in life and keep them challenged, and we end up with a pretty strong culture.”Mr Templeton spent several years in sales and marketing before being moved to operations in Houston, where he managed some of TI’s microprocessor businesses. He became a vice-president of the semiconductor group in 1991, a senior vice-president in 1994 and president of the business in 1996.It was a time when TI was still a diversified company with interests in defence, PCs and memory chips. Under Jerry Junkins, as chairman, president and chief executive, the company began to reinvent itself and Tom Engibous, who took over when Junkins died of a heart attack in 1996, continued the work as he brought more focus to the company.“You really have seen us now on a 10-year-plus transformation, really getting focused on DSP [digital signal processors] and analogue,” Mr Templeton says.In the 1990s, he began working with Mr Engibous, who came from the analogue side of the business. “We really felt from the moment we started working together that we could do something pretty important with both analogue and DSP.”Analogue has counter-intuitively become more important as technology has become digitised. Pictures and sounds have become increasingly available in different digital forms from cameras to voice conversations to MP3 players, creating a need to convert them back and forth between real-world analogue forms and digital. As well as such converters, TI’s analogue business makes products such as amplifiers and power management units.Its DSP business has been the foundation of its success in the mobile phone industry. DSPs handle voice data when it is converted from analogue to digital and back, and have proved themselves to be the most efficient type of processors for the task. Mr Templeton spotted the potential early on for TI to expand this business through the mobile phone industry.“To me, it was always absolutely obvious, even in 1991 and 1992. It was as much because you could see where electronics were moving – the PC was not going to be the most important electronic product forever.”He says TI has built its position as the leading chip supplier by working closely with major customers such as Nokia and organising its business to cater for their needs. It formed a business group in 1994 that was not designed according to its own product lines but those of its customers – a wireless terminals group.“We did it very early and it allowed us to think and look like and act with the customer in mind. As a result, you see decisions that today look obvious, but when we did them they looked very early.”One example is the compressing of functions on to a single chip known as the LoCosto, which is now giving it an advantage in helping to make cheap phones for emerging markets.Mr Templeton was chief operating officer from 2000 until 2004, when he became president and chief executive. As chief operating officer, he saw TI through the worst downturn the chip industry has known. As chief executive he is seeing it benefit from a golden age for the mobile phone, with more than 1bn phones expected to be sold worldwide this year.Analysts are now predicting slowing growth as developed markets become saturated, but the TI chief is unperturbed.“Focus your team on relative market performance and good things will happen,” he advises. “If the market is going to grow 10 per cent, we want to be above 10 per cent and the beauty about a culture that orients itself around relative performance is that you actually control your destiny as opposed to being held accountable to an absolute number.”He also believes in taking the long view: “Five years from now, two thirds of the world’s population could have a [mobile phone] in their hands. They lose them, they break them, they upgrade them. So should I be more or less optimistic about the number of people who will be using wireless terminals? To me, that’s a no-brainer.”He sees TI chips helping to turn camera phones into camcorder phones over the next few years and handsets with built-in FM radios becoming terminals for live television. Other areas of expansion he is exploring include technology for the health sector and high-definition televisions.“Our job is to help companies such as Nokia and Motorola be successful. I want our customers to be the star of the show,” he says, explaining why he believes TI should stay in the background and not have a Microsoft or “Intel Inside” branding approach.“Where I’ve got great faith is if we do [make them successful] and we do it really well, all the other external metrics will take care of themselves over time.”
256;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-07T17:43:25Z;Company man takes the stage;;As the Consumer Electronics Show opens in Las Vegas today, one chief executive can make a safe bet the components his company makes feature inside more of the products on display than any other’s.Texas Instruments is the world’s third largest semiconductor company by revenue after Intel and Samsung, but Rich Templeton says it probably leads both in its reach across every industry represented at the US’s largest trade show – from consumer electronics to computers, mobile phones and the auto industry.“I think the leadership standard that might be more important, although you can’t measure it, is whether you are touching more customers – are you most important to the largest number of customers?”In the chief executive’s view, TI is number one in those terms. It is the biggest supplier of chips to mobile phone makers, while its business converting analogue pictures and sounds into digital signals has 50,000 customers.“Find me a company that’s in the design and manufacturing of electronic equipment and I’ll guarantee they buy at least one analogue component, which means I have a chance to sell a component to every single electronic manufacturing company in the world,” he says.The 48-year-old first joined TI as a salesman in 1980 after earning a degree in electrical engineering from Union College in New York, his home state, where IBM has its headquarters and his father worked as a manager. He has been based in Texas ever since – TI has its headquarters in Dallas and he lives there with his wife and three teenage children.While the semiconductor industry is notorious for executives jumping from one company to another, Mr Templeton is an example of how Texas Instruments has bred an IBM-style company man who stays loyal throughout his career.“I don’t know if it’s in my background – some of it is obviously, with the time that my father was at IBM – but I think in the senior management team you will see the same profile,” he says. “We take people from college, give them plenty of responsibility early in life and keep them challenged, and we end up with a pretty strong culture.”Mr Templeton spent several years in sales and marketing before being moved to operations in Houston, where he managed some of TI’s microprocessor businesses. He became a vice-president of the semiconductor group in 1991, a senior vice-president in 1994 and president of the business in 1996.It was a time when TI was still a diversified company with interests in defence, PCs and memory chips. Under Jerry Junkins, as chairman, president and chief executive, the company began to reinvent itself and Tom Engibous, who took over when Junkins died of a heart attack in 1996, continued the work as he brought more focus to the company.“You really have seen us now on a 10-year-plus transformation, really getting focused on DSP [digital signal processors] and analogue,” Mr Templeton says.In the 1990s, he began working with Mr Engibous, who came from the analogue side of the business. “We really felt from the moment we started working together that we could do something pretty important with both analogue and DSP.”Analogue has counter-intuitively become more important as technology has become digitised. Pictures and sounds have become increasingly available in different digital forms from cameras to voice conversations to MP3 players, creating a need to convert them back and forth between real-world analogue forms and digital. As well as such converters, TI’s analogue business makes products such as amplifiers and power management units.Its DSP business has been the foundation of its success in the mobile phone industry. DSPs handle voice data when it is converted from analogue to digital and back, and have proved themselves to be the most efficient type of processors for the task. Mr Templeton spotted the potential early on for TI to expand this business through the mobile phone industry.“To me, it was always absolutely obvious, even in 1991 and 1992. It was as much because you could see where electronics were moving – the PC was not going to be the most important electronic product forever.”He says TI has built its position as the leading chip supplier by working closely with major customers such as Nokia and organising its business to cater for their needs. It formed a business group in 1994 that was not designed according to its own product lines but those of its customers – a wireless terminals group.“We did it very early and it allowed us to think and look like and act with the customer in mind. As a result, you see decisions that today look obvious, but when we did them they looked very early.”One example is the compressing of functions on to a single chip known as the LoCosto, which is now giving it an advantage in helping to make cheap phones for emerging markets.Mr Templeton was chief operating officer from 2000 until 2004, when he became president and chief executive. As chief operating officer, he saw TI through the worst downturn the chip industry has known. As chief executive he is seeing it benefit from a golden age for the mobile phone, with more than 1bn phones expected to be sold worldwide this year.Analysts are now predicting slowing growth as developed markets become saturated, but the TI chief is unperturbed.“Focus your team on relative market performance and good things will happen,” he advises. “If the market is going to grow 10 per cent, we want to be above 10 per cent and the beauty about a culture that orients itself around relative performance is that you actually control your destiny as opposed to being held accountable to an absolute number.”He also believes in taking the long view: “Five years from now, two thirds of the world’s population could have a [mobile phone] in their hands. They lose them, they break them, they upgrade them. So should I be more or less optimistic about the number of people who will be using wireless terminals? To me, that’s a no-brainer.”He sees TI chips helping to turn camera phones into camcorder phones over the next few years and handsets with built-in FM radios becoming terminals for live television. Other areas of expansion he is exploring include technology for the health sector and high-definition televisions.“Our job is to help companies such as Nokia and Motorola be successful. I want our customers to be the star of the show,” he says, explaining why he believes TI should stay in the background and not have a Microsoft or “Intel Inside” branding approach.“Where I’ve got great faith is if we do [make them successful] and we do it really well, all the other external metrics will take care of themselves over time.”It started with a calculatorLike many people working at Texas Instruments, Rich Templeton’s introduction to the company was the calculator he used in high school during the 1970s.TI invented the handheld electronic calculator in 1967 and its $150 Datamath model with a red LED display became its first consumer electronics product in 1972.TI went on to make own-brand watches, educational toys and computers, but only the calculator, in its different forms, survives today.It represents a tiny second division of the company next to the main semiconductor business – revenues of about $75m (£39m) are expected from calculators in the fourth quarter compared with $3.35bn from chips.Nevertheless, the calculator is profitable and its influence and historic relevance pays dividends: “It’s a good business in terms of the returns it generates, and it introduces future engineers and customers to TI,” says Mr Templeton.He is now building for TI a strong brand association with high-definition television through the group’s Digital Light Processing technology, designed for projectors and rear-projection TVs.He recalls speaking to students at Georgia Institute of Technology recently: “I asked what TI is known for and hands went up and the majority of them said ‘calculator, calculator, calculator’.“But a number raised their hands and said DLP TV – so what was probably represented there was our past and potentially some transition to the future.”
257;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Motorola shares fall on sales warning;;Shares in Motorola, the second largest mobile phone maker after Finland’s Nokia, fell by as much as 12 per cent in early trading on Friday after the US company warned that “an unfavourable geographical and product-tier mix of sales” meant sales and earnings in the fourth quarter would be lower than expected.The shares fell by $2.20, or 10.7 per cent, to $18.35 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after sinking as low as $18 earlier in the session – their lowest level since July 2004.Motorola’s disappointing outlook dragged down Nokia and chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and Qualcomm.The warning, issued on Thursday after the US markets had closed, triggered downgrades for Motorola from analysts who said that while unit sales remained strong, fierce price competition in the fourth quarter had driven down average selling prices.Motorola said it sold about 66m handsets during the quarter, up 23 per cent from the third quarter of 2006 and 48 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2005.However, analysts said that Motorola had cut prices of many of its most popular handsets in the run-up to the holiday season to maintain market share.Motorola’s popular but ageing Razr phone and the Q smartphone were among the handsets hardest hit, analysts said. Demand for the KRZR K1, the successor to the Razr, had been lower than expected.Motorola now expected to earn 13-16 cents per share on sales of $11.6bn-$11.8bn (£6bn-£6.1bn), down from estimates of $11.8bn-$12.1bn. The figure includes about 10 cents in charges.“We are very disappointed with our fourth-quarter financial performance,” said Ed Zander, chief executive.Motorola gave few details of the causes of the shortfall, other than saying the problems were in its mobile devices segment. Fourth-quarter results for both the networks, enterprise and connected home segments are expected to meet or exceed internal expectations at the start of the quarter.
258;TXN;Texas Instruments;2007-01-02T23:34:02Z;The market for mobile light switches;;"They used to fettle knives of locally forged steel in Jennic’s Sheffield headquarters. The steelmen are gone, but the building, refurbished inside and out, houses an activity at the cutting edge of a more recent technology.The privately held Jennic – the word derives from the founder Jim Lindop’s daughters Jennifer and Nicola – is unlikely ever to be a household name. But over the past 10 years it has achieved a reputation for world-class electronic circuit designs for top-tier customers such as IBM and Texas Instruments.Now Mr Lindop and his team are betting the company on a single wireless technology, the curiously named ZigBee, and a
market that hardly exists yet – that for wireless microcontrollers.Mr Lindop acknowledges the risk: “No other company is as focused on this as we are. We have to do this well. We have a single investor, a single chief executive and a single management team, and we have to make a success of this.”ZigBee is a wireless standard like Bluetooth – the technology often found in wireless mobile phone earpieces – but with a difference. ZigBee chips are cheap, have very low power requirements and can operate over hundreds of metres. They are at their best when connected to a network to control, say, heating and lighting in a building.For example, an ordinary light switch fitted with a ZigBee microcontroller would be able to operate the lights without wiring. The switch could be stuck on a wall and moved around to suit different decors.“You can save huge amounts of money by eliminating wiring in the walls of new buildings and improve environmental sensing and control in older ones. This is essentially what the wireless sensor market is,” says Mr Lindop.While he has taken a big bet on the success of the technology, Mr Lindop can take heart from the fact that ZigBee is an international standard supported by hundreds of companies world-wide through an industry lobby called the ZigBee Alliance.Jennic is manufacturing ZigBee chips by the thousand and gearing up for expansion. The company has spent £25m over the past six years and expects to spend another £15m before it turns a profit, possibly in 2009.An electronic circuit designer by training, Mr Lindop worked for Rolls-Royce, designed electronic musical instruments and spent some years as a consultant before founding Jennic in his native Sheffield 10 years ago. The company specialised in designing specialised electronic circuits to be embedded in silicon chips.The growth of the internet brought new demands for yet more specialised circuitry and Jennic, with only a handful of designers, felt the need for cash for expansion. At this point, a friend introduced Mr Lindop, who at the time was somewhat averse to venture capitalists, to the Healeys, a wealthy family looking for investment opportunities in the nascent electronics industries. The family agreed in 1999 to take a half share in the company for a cash injection of several million pounds. Jennic expanded in months from 20 to almost 100 engineers.Then, in 2000, the internet bubble burst. Orders dropped overnight as the company’s big customers switched off their subcontractors. Mr Lindop was forced to dismiss more than half his staff. The Healeys remained supportive, providing working capital while Mr Lindop and his team rethought their strategy.“We focused on what we were good at – designs which mixed digital and analogue signals on the same chip – and we looked for a large market opportunity.”The market for wired microcontrollers is worth some $8bn to $10bn (£4bn to £5bn) a year, which suggests that the opportunity for
Jennic could be substantial. In 2006 it sold 1,000 evaluation kits (at $1,000 a pop) to companies such as Johnson Controls and Honeywell.Mr Lindop, however, tempers optimism with caution: “What percentage of the microcontroller market will go wireless? I don’t think we know. The problem with an emerging market is that you can see it coming, but rarely as quickly as you expect.”But the US consultancy West Technology Research Solutions, an expert in ZigBee technology, believes the market for wireless microcontrollers has arrived and that Jennic has “catapulted itself into a position of market leadership”. According to Kirsten West, its principal analyst, “If there is one company in the ZigBee market most likely to repeat the success of Cambridge Silicon Radio [a world leader in Bluetooth], it is Jennic.”There are competitors: start-ups such as Ember and mature companies such as Texas Instruments and Freescale. But Jennic argues that in wireless microcontrollers, it alone can offer
a single-chip solution,
evaluation kit, software and support.“The thing we have to prove next is that we can scale this up,” says Mr Lindop. “We have to move from thousands to millions of chips a week. That needs different skills.”"
259;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-12-13T05:03:56Z;US to give tax relief for ‘phantom’ gains;;US President George W. Bush is expected to sign into law by next week a bill that will give relief to employees who were taxed on “phantom” share options gains they never received.The enactment of the legislation will allow refunds to be claimed from January by employees at companies such as Cisco and Intel that paid tax on the paper value of share options that later lost much of their value.The legislation will give relief to many of the employees hit hardest when the technology bubble burst.The bill reforms a tax on incentive on stock options that was designed to encourage long-term share ownership by employees, but exposed them to huge financial risk by taxing the theoretical gains they made when the stock was purchased, not when it was sold.Staff of those companies could have avoided disproportionate tax liabilities by selling their shares shortly after they exercised their options, but many did not get suitable financial advice and held onto the stock even as the shares declined.Jay Cena, who worked for Network Appliance in California in the late 1990s, said the financial advice available to first-time shareholders was inadequate because of overwhelming demand.“We were all working 12 hour days, we didn’t have time to read the fine print. My parents couldn’t advise me – they were blue collar and live in New Jersey. We had no experience of share ownership,” he said.“I was on medical leave undergoing chemotherapy treatment when I got a call from my account saying you have a big tax bill,” he added.Mr Cena was left owing more than $2.1m in tax on stock options once worth $3m, even though the shares had plunged.The former tech worker joined others in a long campaign for relief that was taken up by Congressman Richard Neal, who represents a Massachusetts district with many EMC employees, and Congressman Sam Johnson, who represents a district with large numbers of staff from Texas Instruments.The enactment of the bill – which was passed by Congress over the weekend - means those hit by the tax can expect to receive a cheque from the government in about a year’s time if they claim before April.But lobbyists said it was unclear how the Internal Revenue Service would treat those who faced penalties for earlier non-payment of the tax.
260;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-12-12T21:39:12Z;US stocks fall as Fed keeps rates unchanged;;US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors reacted to earnings news from Best Buy and Nucor and the decision by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, reported net income of 31 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 35 cents. Shares sank to close 5 per cent at $51.30.Steelmaker Nucor, which hit a 52-week high last week, was down 7.4 per cent at $59.60 after it provided a fourth-quarter forecast below analysts’ expectations, citing low prices for its products and high inventories.Other steelmakers followed Nucor lower, with US Steel shares down 5.1 per cent at $73.26.Goldman Sachs reported a 93 per cent jump in earnings for the fourth quarter ending November 30, boosted by record takeover activity and strong trading across markets.Earnings per share were $6.59, above 2005’s $3.35, and well ahead of an expected $6 a share.In spite of this stellar performance, shares in the brokerage were 1.2 per cent lower at $200.Citigroup, meanwhile, named Robert Druskin as its new chief operating officer, elevating him from president and chief executive of the bank’s corporate and investment banking arm. Shares in Citigroup slipped 1.2 per cent to $52.25.Texas Instruments, the maker of mobile phone chips, lowered its fourth-quarter sales and earnings forecast.The shares sank in overnight trade, but an upgrade from JPMorgan, to overweight from neutral helped push the shares 1.6 per cent higher to $29.77 by midday.Sabre Holdings jumped 5 per cent to $31.96 after it agreed to be acquired by private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group for about $4.5bn in cash, including $550m of debt, or $32.75 a share.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Stock Market formally launched its $5.3bn hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange, seeking to build upon its current holding of 28.75 per cent.The LSE has rejected Nasdaq’s overtures.Shares in the US exchange were 1.5 per cent lower at $35.57.The S&P 500 Index closed down 0.1 per cent or 1.48 points at 1,411.56 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.5 per cent, or 11.26 points, lower at 2,431.6.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent or 12.9 points at 12.315.58.Analysts said sentiment for stocks remained positive heading into year-end, a period often marked by a rally in prices.“Economic data have generally been mixed since the last FOMC meeting, with employment conditions remaining firm in the face of flagging housing activity,” noted William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS.
261;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-12-12T00:36:33Z;TI signals industry slowdown;;Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, on Monday signalled an industry slowdown as it lowered its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter.TI, considered a bellwether stock by semiconductor analysts, dropped its profit expectations from between 40 and 46 cents a share to 37 to 40 cents.“I would say wireless has weakened further than our expectations in October,” Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, told an analyst conference call.He was referring to a third-quarter results call when cell phones were already identified as TI’s main area of less-than-seasonal demand entering the fourth quarter.TI’s biggest concentration of chips is in high-end “smart” phones using next-generation technology.“3G continues to be an area of softness,” said Mr Slaymaker.The Dallas-based chipmaker, number three in the world, is a key supplier of chips for Nokia and other handset-makers. It can provide an early warning of slowdowns in the industry.The Gartner research firm last month raised its estimates for 2006 to 986m handsets being sold after 251m sales were recorded in the third quarter.But Informa Telecoms & Media predicted growth of about 16 per cent this year would fall to 3 per cent by 2011 as markets matured.TI said its fourth-quarter revenue expectations were in a lower range of $3.35bn to $3.50bn, down from $3.46bn to $3.75bn.It said its expectations for semiconductors in general were broadly lower.“We don’t believe this has bottomed yet, we’re likely to see first-quarter revenue lower than the current quarter,” said Mr Slaymaker.He said the company was taking action by constraining costs – cutting down on travel and new hires. It was also reining in production in its factories and in the third-party foundries it used.Despite this, its inventories had grown from the third quarter, peaking in November and on the decline since then. New orders were down and TI’s book-to-bill ratio was likely to be less than one for the current quarter.TI shares were flat at $29.29 on the news in extended trading in New York.
262;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-11-22T19:12:38Z;Nearing the magic billion;;"This is a golden year for the cellphone industry and all who sail with it.
More than a quarter of a billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in the third quarter, according to today’s figures from Gartner, and with the holiday season ahead, there must be a chance of hitting 1bn this year for the first time.
Sales of 251m in Q3 were up 21.5 per cent on last year and Gartner raised its full-year forecast to 986m units, with 281m forecast in Q4.
For chipmakers, it has been nothing but good news for the likes of Texas Instruments, the biggest supplier of chips for cellphones, and Qualcomm.
But this may be the best of times as slower growth lies ahead, according to Informa Telecoms & Media. It predicted last month annual growth of around 16 per cent this year will have declined to 3 per cent by 2011, when 1.255bn phones will be sold.
""The growth in developing markets such as India, China and Latin America is impressive but we are not seeing the same levels of phone take-up per capita,"" said Dave McQueen, Principal Analyst.
""With handset sales in saturated developed markets being much slower and reliant on replacement of old models, the net effect is a major slowdown in overall rate of growth from next year.""

263;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-10-24T20:58:11Z;Market Overview: Equity markets pause as investors await Fed;;US and European equity markets paused for breath on Tuesday as investors on both sides of the Atlantic digested the latest corporate earnings reports and awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting.At the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average pared earlier losses and was up 0.1 per cent at a new record close of 12,127.88 and the S&P 500 was 0.03 per cent firmer. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower, undermined by a disappointing statement from Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, on its earnings outlook.Overall the third-quarter earnings season in the US has been very positive, with 73 per cent of those companies that have reported beating expectations and only 13 per cent falling short, according to Thomson Financial.“This proves that the US economy is continuing to rock and roll,” said David Dropsey, research analyst.Europe has also seen an encouraging trend, with roughly two-thirds of companies that have reported so far beating estimates.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index, which recently enjoyed a nine-day winning run, retreated just 0.02 per cent from Monday’s five-year high. The strength of earnings growth appears to back up the confident stance adopted by equity investors in recent weeks although Dominic White, economist at ABN Amro, said this appeared to raise a fundamental inconsistency.“The equity market’s confidence about growth doesn’t seem to extend to the implications this has for inflation and interest rates,” he said. “With the US and global economies now operating near full capacity, even a modest recovery in growth could see inflation and interest rates rise further.”Although virtually no one in the markets expects the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday, there will be much interest in how the central bank sees the outlook for inflation and growth – particularly with regard to the housing slowdown. There has been some evidence that the US housing market might not be as problematic as many had feared.August housing starts unexpectedly jumped and Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, recently said he thought the worst of the slowdown was over.Christopher Towner, head of desk for risk management at HIFX, suggested that the equity market was picking up the baton in terms of momentum from the US housing market. He also noted that the housing markets in the UK and Australia, which were causing concern a year ago, had recovered.“The majority of wealth in the US is in housing. However, the Americans also have a large proportion of their wealth tied up in equities,” Mr Towner said.“If the Dow and lower oil prices can propel consumer confidence, then perhaps we will see the situation in the US economy follow the path to higher rates as in the UK and Australia.”The dollar initially rose against the yen and the euro amid continued expectations that the Fed would re-emphasise its worries about inflation. The greenback’s early gains faded away as the session wore on.Treasury bonds recouped some of Monday’s steep losses while European government bonds ended the day little changed as the market awaited Wednesday’s Ifo German business sentiment survey.Oil staged a modest rally, with December West Texas Intermediate edging back above $59 a barrel in New York. Gold bounced off a one-week low as it took its lead from the oil price.
264;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-10-24T20:55:11Z;US stocks quiet as Fed meets;;US stocks were caught in narrow ranges on Tuesday, as earnings continued flowing while unsettled investors were distracted by the two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.36 points, or 0.03 per cent, at 1,377.38 while the Nasdaq Composite was 10.72 points, or 0.5 per cent, lower at 2,344.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled up 10.97 points at 12,127.88, marking its fourth record close in five days.Some observers warn that the surge in equities since markets bottomed in July might not be sustainable. “The break-neck expansion of the past three months may give way to a needed short-term pause in the coming weeks,” noted David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Among steel-makers Nucor was up $6.47, or 11.74 per cent, at $61.58 and US Steel up $3.61, or 5.4 per cent at $70.19. Carmaker General Motors hit a 52-week peak for the second successive day with investors expecting good earnings on Wednesday as GM executes its turnround plan. GM rose $1, or 2.8 per cent, to $36.19 and is up 86 per cent for the year.Chemicals group DuPont, trimmed earlier gains, but closed 55 cents, or 1.2 per cent, higher at $46 after posting stronger than expected earnings and reiterating a solid outlook for 2006.Hurting the Nasdaq was a decline in Qualcomm. Its shares fell $1.37, or 3.6 per cent, to $36.71 on reports that its patent case against Nokia might be reviewed by the courts.Lucent rose 15 cents, or 6.4 per cent, at $2.49, on earnings of 7 cents per share, above consensus estimates of 4 cents. The telecomms equipment maker is being acquired by France’s Alcatel. The deal is expected to close at the end of the year.Taking a tumble was Tellabs, down 62 cents, or 5.6 per cent, at $10.40 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in profits, but its broadband division saw sales growth rise just 3 per cent.TD Ameritrade fell 79 cents, or 4.75 per cent to $15.84 while shares in Omnicom were up $6.23, or 6.6 per cent, at $101.11 after the advertising group delivered earnings of estimates.Appliance maker Whirlpool cut its estimate for appliance industry unit shipment growth in North America. Its shares were down $2.63, or 2.9 per cent, at $86.70.Reporting weaker than forecast results for the third quarter was Kraft Foods, which dropped 94 cents or 2.6 per cent, at $35.36.Texas Instruments was down $1.36, or 4.3 per cent, at $30.52 after it missed estimates and lowered guidance for the fourth quarter.First Data shares rose 54 cents, or 2.4 per cent, to $23.49 after the company announced a $700m share buy-back and first quarterly earnings since selling Western Union. Separately, Western Union rose 37 cents, or 1.9 per cent, at $19.95 after its earnings beat estimates.
265;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;TI sees slower mobile chip growth;;"Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, warned on Monday that orders declined in the third quarter and would probably lead to weaker semiconductor growth than normal in the fourth.TI blamed an inventory correction in Japan and a mix more weighted towards low-priced cell phones – echoing the comments of its biggest customer Nokia last week.The Dallas-based chip maker matched its own and Wall Street’s expectations of profits of 45 cents a share for the third quarter but fell short on revenues, reporting $3.76bn. Analysts expected $3.8bn, according to Reuters Estimates, and the company had narrowed its own range to $3.71bn to $3.87bn in a September update, for a mid-point of $3.79bn.TI shares fell 1 per cent to $31.55 in after-hours trading after closing 1.6 per cent higher in New York.Analysts had suspected a softer fourth-quarter for TI, particularly after Nokia’s comments. It reported a
4 per cent fall in third-quarter profits as average selling prices for its phones fell. This was caused by weaker sales of more advanced and pricier 3G phones in Europe and solid sales of low-
end phones in emerging markets such as China and India.Rich Templeton, TI chief executive, said its customers were also comfortable operating with lower inventories now that chip supplies had improved.In addition, NTT DoCoMo had built up its inventory in the first half, in anticipation of a surge in demand in the second half.Japanese consumers are able to take their existing numbers with them if they switch services from this month – tempting many to change operators and buy new phones."
266;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-10-10T20:16:04Z;Broadcom fails to block Qualcomm chip imports;;Broadcom has failed in its efforts to block US imports of millions of mobile phones containing chips made by its rival Qualcomm.The two chipmakers are engaged in a long-running legal battle over patents and access to the lucrative mobile phone market, but the latest decision, by the International Trade Commission, has favoured San Diego-based Qualcomm.Judge Charles Bullock said Qualcomm’s chips and the phones that contain them did infringe a Broadcom patent. But he said he did not recommend that an order banning Qualcomm chips in the US should also cover mobile phones made by other companies.Qualcomm shares were 2.8 per cent higher on the news at $37.27 in midday trading in New York, while Broadcom shares fell 2.8 per cent to $28.76.The judge ruled that Qualcomm had not infringed two other Broadcom patents. His decision is subject to review by the full commission and can then be challenged in the federal appeals court.Last week, a judge in San Diego tried unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the the chairmen of the two companies. Irwin Jacobs of Qualcomm met Broadcom’s Henry Samueli for more than five hours but they failed to reach a deal on extensive patent disputes that include allegations of theft of company secrets and anti-competitive actions.Court cases and complaints to regulators are also taking place in New Jersey, Europe and South Korea.Broadcom is appealing a New Jersey antitrust case that was thrown out in August due to insufficient evidence. It is also one of six chip and cellphone makers that complained to the European Commission last year, alleging anti-competitive practices by Qualcomm in charging royalties that were too high for its patents.Qualcomm is the number two maker of chips for cellphones behind Texas Instruments.
267;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-09-12T12:58:57Z;Wall Street ticks higher in nervous trading;;US stocks closed only marginally higher on Monday after a day of nervous trading with a sell-off in the commodities sector.Crude prices sank for a sixth straight day as Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment programme and ministers of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said they would keep production levels unchanged.The news drove crude to a six-month low, damping energy stocks, and the S&P energy index sank to an eight-week low.Chevron sank 3.5 per cent to $62.00 and ExxonMobil dropped 2.8 per cent to $64.94.Gold, meanwhile, suffered its biggest one-day fall since June, dragging Barrick Gold down 5.7 per cent to $29.58 and Newmont Mining 5.4 per cent lower to $45.57.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 0.62 points, at 1,299.54, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent, or 7.46 points, at 2,173.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 4.73 points at 11,396.84.The presidents of the Boston and St. Louis Federal Reserves both said the US economy was continuing to grow robustly, but warned that inflation was above the central bank’s comfort level. Markets were mostly unmoved by the comments.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said investors were largely trading in a vacuum until the consumer price index data is released on Friday.“We don’t have much to trade off for these first few days of the week,” he said. “You’re not going to be able to make much progress until the end of the week.”Broader fears of a slowdown in global economic growth depressed other commodity prices, especially copper. Phelps Dodge dipped 7.7 per cent to $84.05 and Freeport McMoran declined 7.5 per cent to $53.95.Steelmakers were bruised, with Nucor losing 6.6 per cent to a three-month low of $46.37 and US Steel off 3.5 per cent at $57.93.Dell Computer lost 2.1 per cent to $21.19 after it said it would suspend its share buyback programme and delay filing its quarterly report due to a probe by financial regulators.However, other technology stocks ticked higher. Chipmaker Texas Instruments jumped 2.5 per cent to $31.78, and Oracle added 2.4 per cent to $16.29.Freescale Semiconductor, which was spun off from Motorola in 2004, soared 20.5 per cent to $37.06 on news reports that it might be bought for $16bn.Pharmaceutical group Genentech said the Food and Drug Administration had requested additional safety information about its Avastin drug before it could be approved for use by breast cancer patients. Its shares slipped 4.6 per cent to $78.33.Aetna jumped 5.3 per cent to $38.43 after an executive said medical costs for the health insurer would not be as high in the rest of 2006 as it had predicted.
268;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-09-11T23:10:52Z;Texas Instruments warns of chip glut;;Texas Instruments on Monday narrowed the range of its third-quarter forecasts and said its sales of chips for cell phones would be hit by an inventory build-up at Japan’s NTT DoCoMo wireless operator.TI said revenues from continuing operations would be $3.71bn to $3.87bn, compared to the prior range of $3.63bn to $3.95bn. Semiconductor revenues would be $3.53bn to $3.67bn, narrowed from $3.45bn to $3.75bn.Expected earnings per share of 44 to 46 cents compared to its earlier forecast of 42 to 48 cents.Ron Slaymaker, TI vice president, told analysts that revenue growth for TI, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, was probably going to be a little below the seasonal norm for its wireless chips.He blamed an inventory build-up of cellphones caused by NTT DoCoMo in the first half as it prepared for a surge in demand in the second half. Japanese consumers will be able to keep their existing numbers if they switch services from next month, enticing many to change operators and buy new phones.Mr Slaymaker said the inventory build-up would mean lower sales of TI’s Omap chips.“Were it not for that, we would expect [the quarter] to be completely consistent with low double-digit sequential growth,” he added.Forecasts for TI’s Educational and Productivity Solutions – its calculator business – remained the same at revenues of $180m to $200m.The mid-points of the new figures remained virtually in line with analyst-consensus forecasts of earnings of 45 cents on sales of 3.804bn.TI shares were down 1.3 per cent in after-hours trading at $31.38 on the news.The figures did not include TI’s Sensors and Control business, which was sold earlier this year.
269;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-08-24T17:11:09Z;Lulu aims to wag the internet ‘long tail’;;"The Curta calculator, a mechanical adding machine shaped like a coffee grinder, was made redundant in the 1970s when its electronic successor was popularised by Texas Instruments. Bob Young, who collects the antiquated devices, wants to wreak similar havoc in the book publishing industry today.Such chutzpah might be dismissed if Mr Young did not have form for successful, disruptive ideas. As co-founder of Red Hat, the open-source software company, Mr Young has built a formidable challenger to the dominance of Microsoft by helping rethink the industry’s business model, making ­himself a billionaire in the process.Back in the mid-1990s, Red Hat broke with the industry tradition – in which a tightly knit group of software developers produced tools that were sold for ­royalties – by allowing anybody to contribute to programming code. With Red Hat, now the biggest distributor of the landmark open-source operating system known as Linux, Mr Young has proved that money can be made from providing installation and support.For his next business opportunity, Mr Young decided to “solve a social problem” while also building a new company – rather than using the money earned at Red Hat to make a large purchase. “I’m not Rupert Murdoch, so I’m not going to throw half a billion dollars at MySpace or whatever the next MySpace is. I’m an entrepreneur – so if I can find the next engineer building the next MySpace I’d be happy to help.”There is no guarantee, of course, that his latest venture, Lulu – a self-publishing outfit for books and films – will have the impact on dead trees and celluloid that Red Hat had on software. “I have no idea what I’m doing,” says Mr Young. “The guys running Google have no idea what they’re going to do. We’re making it up as we go along.”Lulu.com, a self-publishing site, and Lulu.tv, a novel way of distributing revenues to film-makers, are the twin weapons in this. Both rely on the internet’s “long tail” – the term describing its capacity to help niche products find an audience and make a profit.Authors write a description of their book, upload it, choose a binding, find a cover image and set the price. “We make you the publisher so you don’t have to go through Random House and get lots of rejection slips,” says Mr Young.The revolution is not only internet driven; it relies on advances in printing technology too. New professional digital printers can cost as much as their traditional offset rivals, but there is little or no additional cost for printing different books. Until recently, volume has been essential to profitability; but on a digital printer 1,000 copies of 30 different books costs the same as 30,000 copies of a single book.The Lulu top 10 bestseller list is an extraordinary ­collection ranging from Pay-Per-Click Search Engine Marketing Handbook at number one, through The Didymus Contingency, a supernatural thriller, to How to Become an Alpha Male, described as “the lazy man’s way to easy sex and romance with 20 or more women a month”.Although Lulu was founded on the possibility of exploiting the long tail, Mr Young still had to learn that traditional marketing could sometimes be futile. Near the beginning of the project, which was launched three years ago, Mr Young saw that a serious-looking ­scientific title had been uploaded to Lulu. He contacted the author to ask if he wanted a big promotional slot on the site.“The author said: ‘I should warn you that there’s a worldwide market for my book of about 162 people and I know 148 of them’,” says Mr Young. In traditional publishing, he contends, an academic imprint would have turned down the project or sought a high price from buyers for covering the costs of a short print run. “At Reed Elsevier, they would have a price of $1,500 and you would have sold three,” says Mr Young.With the self-publishing internet model, this part of the long tail can find its select band of readers, who pay a modest price – of which 20 per cent goes to Lulu and 80 per cent to the author. The motive for self-publishing is often to pass on specialist skills rather than make a quick buck. Mr Young says that a scientist-author, for example, “makes money on the project – admittedly not a lot of money but he makes the world a better place”.About 50 people are making a “decent wage” from publishing through Lulu, according to the company; and Lulu itself is seeing moderate but fast-growing sales as it takes a slice from each book. It made revenues of $1m in 2004, $5m in 2005 and is forecasting $15m (£7.9m) for 2006.The model has been “highly profitable” but most of the spare cash is ploughed back into Lulu and its associated projects. “We’d be even more profitable if we stopped doing wild and crazy things,” says Mr Young.Mr Young is in London to spread the message about one of these: Lulu.tv, the next step in his self-publishing vehicle’s evolution and the latest attempt to profit from the internet’s long tail. Constantly smiling, wiry and nervously energetic, the 52-year-old entrepreneur is evangelical about this latest assault on the media world.Video-makers pay $14.95 a month. Eighty per cent of the fees are put into a pot and this money is divided according to which videos attract the most viewers. Mr Young says the competition here is coming not just from the traditional media companies – although they are hungrily acquiring new media assets as their audience fragments – but from the new breed of online video companies such as YouTube and Google Video.“They’re doing a good job as channels but a less good job in funnelling back money to the creators,” says Mr Young.In contrast to Lulu the publishing vehicle, Lulu.tv is “embryonic”, Mr Young admits. Its business model is not as developed as the “dead-tree” side and, while publishers have been shaken by the digitisation of their medium, video has quickly attracted the biggest internet companies, including Google and traditional giants such as Viacom.Mr Young is not alone in seeking profits from the long tail. But given his record, he stands more chance of finding the right business model than being left with the latter-day equivalent of the Curta calculator.Inspired by Smith and JobsThe world of open-source software was once anathema to US software giants such as Microsoft and Oracle. Its emphasis on sharing intellectual property went against the grain of established companies that spent time and money safeguarding their products’ secrets.But Bob Young, who co-founded Red Hat, the open-source software company, is no anarchist. His hero is Adam Smith. “If the citizen and the consumer are the same thing in a free-market economy, the bigger the social problem you can solve, the bigger the business opportunity must be,” he says.Coming out of Red Hat in 2002 and searching for the “social problem” on which to base his next venture, he was struck by the controversy shaking the music industry over file-sharing on websites sites such as Napster.“We were watching the music industry suing their customers because they didn’t understand [the phenomenon],” he says. “It wasn’t about price. The music industry wanted you to get into your car, drive across town to the music store, pay $20 for a CD with 19 songs you didn’t really want, drive back home and somehow get the music on to your computer to listen to it.”“It took Steve Jobs, a computer geek [and CEO of Apple Computer], to see this problem and come up with the solution [the iTunes online music store and iPod music player].”He has a personal motivation, too, for setting up Lulu, his self-publishing venture. In 1999 he published Under the Radar, his account of the rise of Red Hat. Mr Young was upset about the quality of printing in the book, the meagre royalty payment he collected and the fact that several thousand unsold copies of the book were due to be pulped. He demanded they be sent to him and had them converted into furniture."

Investors are counting on the slowdown in housing to achieve the slowdow in the economy,” he said.Sun Microsystems rose 3.7 per cent to $4.80. Sun was the only company to gain market share in the worldwide server business during the second quarter, according to new data.

272;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-07-24T22:38:49Z;Texas Instruments sees growth for wireless chips;;Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, provided some good news for the semiconductor and mobile phone industries on Monday, reporting strong growth in sales of wireless chips.TI, the biggest maker of chips for cellphones, met analysts’ second-quarter expectations of earnings of 47 cents a share or $739m from continuing operations and revenues of $3.7bn. Revenues were up by 24 per cent on a year earlier and profits up 34 per cent.Its shares rose 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading to $28.85 as its outlook also matched Wall Street’s expectations.It scotched fears of a slowdown in the cellphone market with predictions of seasonal growth in its third quarter and revenues of $3.63bn to $3.95bn and earnings per share of 42 to 48 cents.Rich Templeton, chief executive, described it as another excellent quarter.“All regions of the world showed strong revenue growth from a year ago,” he said.“Revenue from our wireless semiconductors grew 27 per cent, including more than 70 per cent growth in 3G.“Going into the third quarter, our backlog of orders is up and our outlook is for seasonal growth.”Sales of TI’s high-performance analogue semiconductors grew 32 per cent and it reported more operators were adopting GSM cellphone technologies rather than CDMA. TI is the leading GSM chip vendor, while its US rival Qualcomm licenses and manufactures CDMA chips.Ron Slaymaker, TI vice president, told analysts its results had been helped by the performance of three of its biggest customers – Nokia, Motorola and Sony Ericsson – who had reported strong revenue growth from handset sales.TI also makes chips for its patented Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology for digital TVs and reported revenues grew 34 per cent on a year earlier.Overall orders going forward were worth $3.91bn, up $302m on the previous quarter.Semiconductors make up the bulk of TI’s business, accounting for $3.5bn of revenues in the second quarter. Its calculator business recorded sales of $192m, up from $74m in the previous quarter as retailers began to stock up for the back-to-school season. Revenues from the Sensors and Control division were excluded from the figures after its sale on April 27.
273;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-07-24T21:33:32Z;AMD to buy ATI for $5.4bn;;Advanced Micro Devices on Monday took its biggest gamble in its attempt to keep pace with its larger rival Intel, buying graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for $5.4bn in the second largest takeover in the semiconductor industry’s history.AMD has confined itself to building the central processing units (CPUs) of computers until now. The acquisition of ATI allows it to offer the accompanying logic and graphics chipsets in an own-brand “platform” approach that will match that of Intel.But it is buying ATI in the middle of a price war with Intel, at a time when it is committed to spending billions of dollars on expanding its manufacturing capacity and when its shares fell to a 52-week low of $17.41 on Monday.AMD said it would pay $4.2bn in cash and offer 57m AMD shares, which closed at $18.26 on Friday. This would mean it paying $20.47 for each ATI share, a 24 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday.AMD has obtained a $2.5bn loan commitment from Morgan Stanley to help finance the cash portion and has around $3bn in cash and short-term investments available.The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter is the biggest since Texas Instruments acquired Burr-Brown for around $6bn in 2000, according to the Wall Street Access research firm. It will create a company of 15,000 employees, with ATI’s top management team being integrated into that of AMD and its main Toronto facilities being maintained.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, told an analyst conference call he did not expect significant redundancies, although the elimination of overlaps would mean savings of $75m in 2007 and $125m in 2008.Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, said he believed the deal would be meaningfully accretive to earnings in 2008, before charges associated with the acquisition.The deal will mean major shifts in the industry. To date, AMD has worked with a range of chipset manufacturers to complement its microprocessors and relied on its Silicon Valley neighbour Nvidia and ATI to offer PC manufacturers best-of-breed graphics chipsets.AMD insisted on Monday that a relationship with Nvidia could still be maintained in some areas of its business. But the close competition between Nvidia and ATI in the graphics field, mirroring that of Intel and AMD in microprocessors, has taken on a new dynamic.Meanwhile, Intel has been a significant customer of ATI, using its chipsets in situations such as shortages of its own chips. It is highly unlikely to do so with ATI under the wing of its biggest rival.Dave Orton, ATI chief executive, said 30 to 40 per cent of revenues for its logic chips came from Intel in its last quarter and Mr Rivet said $80 to $100m a quarter in ATI revenues were Intel related.

276;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
277;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-06-27T17:10:37Z;Intel sells communications business;;Intel has finally admitted defeat in its attempts to become a major player in the mobile phone market, selling its communications and applications processor business to Marvell Technology for $600m.The world’s biggest chipmaker has achieved the dominant position in supplying microprocessors for personal computers, but it has been no more than a niche supplier in mobile phones, where chips from its US rivals Broadcom, Freescale, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments hold sway.The sale announced on Tuesday is the first indication of the restructuring taking place at Intel. Paul Otellini, chief executive, announced in April a 90-day strategic review of the company’s operations that would “leave no stone unturned” and would particularly scrutinise loss-making parts of the corporation.While Intel will not break out numbers, the communications division is believed to be unprofitable. Marvell is expected to take on the “vast majority” of its 1,400-strong workforce and will pay $600m in cash, although Intel has the option to take $100m in stock of its Silicon Valley neighbour, which specialises in storage and communications chips.Marvell will acquire Intel’s Xscale technology, including the “Hermon” processor that powers the Blackberry 8700 device. Its “Bulverde” processor is used in the Palm Treo smart phone, the Motorola Q and other devices.Intel began its assault on the cellphone market after it acquired the technology in 1998 in a complicated deal with Digital Equipment Corporation. This also included its IXP network processor business, which is also understood to be up for sale, with private equity groups appearing to be the most likely buyers.Intel has no plans to abandon its successful wi-fi business that has enabled wireless internet access through its Centrino mobile platform for notebook PCs. It is also continuing to support a new wireless standard that would give broad wi-fi coverage known as Wimax.“We are still big proponents of wi-fi and Wimax, but with cellphones, we decided this was a better fit for Marvell,” said Robert Manetta, Intel spokesman, on Tuesday.Intel shares were up 0.2 per cent in midday trading on the news at $18.32, while Marvell’s fell 13.4 per cent to $44.92.
278;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-06-11T18:23:51Z;Qualcomm braced for EU probe into fees;;Qualcomm, the company behind the CDMA mobile phone standard, is bracing for an investigation of its licensing fees by the European Commission, prompted by complaints from handset makers and rival chipmakers.Qualcomm is being scrutinised by the same team in Brussels that investigated Microsoft and Intel, which dominate PC operating systems and microprocessors.The San Diego-based company has achieved a similar position of influence over the mobile phone industry and its opponents are hopeful that a formal investigation is imminent over what they say is its refusal to license patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.“We gave in a response [to the complaints], so it’s a little bit of a waiting game now,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, told the Financial Times. “I guess I won’t be surprised if there’s an investigation.”Legal advisers to Texas Instruments and Broadcom, the two chipmaker complainants, say the conclusion of a Microsoft appeal against a Brussels decision that it abused its dominant market position means the Commission can now turn its attention to Qualcomm.Qualcomm’s opponents alleged last October that it had reneged on a commitment it made in the 1990s when Europe decided to move from the GSM system to adopt W-CDMA for third-generation (3G) mobile phones – a wireless standard partly based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology.TI, Broadcom, Nokia, Ericsson, NEC and Panasonic all complain Qualcomm has failed to honour a promise to license its technology on reasonable terms – levying the same royalty rate on W-CDMA as its own 3G brand – CDMA 2000 – when its intellectual property is a much smaller proportion of W-CDMA.Mr Jacobs said the royalty rate was a low single-digit percentage. It was justified by the company’s research and development that Qualcomm had carried out to develop a technology that had created a competitive market for other companies to make profits.He said an investigation would not have a big effect on the company he was willing to protect the company by breaking it up if needs be.
279;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-06-09T11:20:17Z;Tokyo stocks recover and join Asia rally;;Japanese stocks joined the rally in Asia, which followed decent results overnight from Texas Instruments of the US.The Nikkei 225 closed up 0.8 per cent to 14,750.84, a day after its worst fall in a year.The index has fallen over 7 per cent this week, its steepest one-week fall in four years. Japan has been caught up in the global rout, while its exporters - like those throughout Asia - suffer from uncertainties over the outlook for the US economy.Some of Thursday’s worst hit stocks made gains on Friday. The steel sector, which was pummelled on Thursday amid concerns of a US slowdown, perked up. Nippon Steel, the world’s number three steelmaker, rose 2.4 per cent to Y391 while JFE Holdings was up 2.8 per cent at 4,480.Banks were more choppy after Goldman Sachs - owner of preferred shares in Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation - issued a “buy” recommendation on the sector. That helped lift Resona Holdings by 4 per cent to Y339,000 but did not stop Mitsubishi UFJ, the goliath of the sector, from falling 1.3 per cent to Y1,490,000.Reports that fixed line giant NTT may have to cut the fees it charges other companies to access its fibre optic lines pushed the fixed line giant’s share price down by 1.7 per cent to Y531,000.
280;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-06-08T22:40:50Z;Strong demand aids TI forecasts;;"Texas Instruments, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, raised its revenue and profit forecasts for the second quarter on Thursday, citing strong demand for a number of its products.TI said sales should be in the range of $3.63bn to $3.78bn in the quarter to June 30. Its prior range had been $3.46bn-$3.75bn. Revenues for its main semiconductor business should be between $3.45bn and $3.59bn, up from $3.29bn-$3.56bn, it added. The company said it expected earnings per share of 46 to 48 cents, up from 38 to 43 cents.The revenues estimate included a $70m cash payment from Conexant Systems for the settlement of patent litigation and a sales-tax benefit for the Dallas-based company coming as the result of an audit process with the state of Texas. The two items were expected to contribute 5 to 6 cents per share to profits. TI shares rose nearly 3 per cent in after-hours trading in New York to $31.60 on the news.“The strength we are seeing is coming from a number of areas . . . we are, broadly-based, ahead of where we had expected,” said Ron Slaymaker, TI vice president.He singled out the chips TI was making for DLP (Digital Light Processing) high-
definition television sets, wireless base station chips and low-power microcontrollers for remote metering.Chips for mobile phones were “performing well, consistent with seasonal norms for the second quarter”.Both third-generation high-end mobile phones and low-end mobiles were selling well, Mr Slaymaker said. TI and its customers were optimistic that the second half would be normal and consistent with expectations.The Semiconductor Industry Association on Tuesday raised its forecasts for the year."
281;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Intel to sell off parts of business;;Intel is planning to sell several of its communications businesses as part of a restructuring of the world’s biggest chipmaker, according to people close to the negotiations.Paul Otellini, chief executive, announced in April a 90-day strategic review of the company’s operations that would “leave no stone unturned” and would particularly scrutinise loss-making areas of the corporation.The sale of Intel’s loss-making communications divisions was first reported over the weekend in the San José Mercury News.Intel has made a success of wi-fi wireless internet access through its Centrino mobile platform for notebook PCs.It is also pushing a new wireless standard that would give broad wi-fi coverage known as Wimax.Intel is not considering selling these operations, but is understood to have earmarked for disposal its loss-making Xscale and IXP chips made for mobile phones, portable devices and network equipment.Intel has so far failed to crack the cellphone market, which is led by Texas Instruments, a chip supplier.Intel’s Xscale application processors, originally acquired from Digital Equipment Corporation as part of a $700m deal, have been largely confined to the smartphone segment, including BlackBerry devices.Its IXP network processor business is also understood to be up for sale, with private equity groups appearing to be the most likely buyers.Bill Kircos, Intel spokesman, said: “We’ve been pretty upfront about our focus on looking at all aspects of our business, we’re not going to speculate on this and it would be inappropriate while we are still in the midst of [this review].”But Terry Garnett, partner at Garnett & Helfrich, a venture buyout group that recently helped Computer Associates and Nortel Networks spin off unwanted divisions, said: “I think it makes a lot of sense [to shed some business units]. This is a huge company that fits the profile.”“They’ve bought a lot of companies over time, and they’re going through the process of what we saw at Computer Associates and Nortel. They’re saying ‘we need to do a strategic review of everything’.”Analysts have also speculated that Intel could dispose of its “Nor” flash memory business, which was reorganised under a new head last month in a move that would make it easier to be sold or spun off.Mr Otellini has promised $1bn in cost savings this year and a $300m reduction in capital spending to boost the company’s performance.Revenues in 2006 are expected to be 3 per cent down on 2005 after a three-year run of double-digit sales growth and Intel’s shares have lost more than a quarter of their value this year.
282;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-05-11T21:06:22Z;Lex: 3G intellectual property;;"Investors are sceptical about 3G. After years of hype, only one in 10 global mobile users actually have 3G phones. Still, the spat between Nokia and Qualcomm over intellectual property suggests 3G has come of age.Qualcomm pioneered CDMA technology, but missed out on the 2G boom, which was largely based on the rival GSM standard. In 3G, however, its position is outstanding, with critical patents owned for both standards (CDMA2000 and WCDMA), which it licenses to handset and component manufacturers. Licence revenues should reach $2.6bn in 2006, of which half should be from 3G.Qualcomm’s model has benefits. Unlike GSM patent owners, it has no conflicts of interest with handset makers. For a fee, anyone should get access to the IP it owns or has aggregated. However, the question is whether that fee, of say 4 per cent of a handset’s price, is fair. Qualcomm says that it has amicable agreements with 130 manufacturers. Still, Nokia, NEC, Ericsson, Panasonic and Texas Instruments all claim that Qualcomm overcharges and discriminates against some chipmakers.These critics say that Qualcomm’s share of WCDMA IP is lower than for CDMA2000, while its royalty rates are the same. Qualcomm disputes this, but offers no other analysis. Financial metrics suggest massively excessive returns. Operating margins at Qualcomm’s IP division exceed 90 per cent. It is entitled to an economic return on its high risk investment. However, IP operating profits of about $2.4bn this year compare embarrassingly well with cumulative research and development spending of $4.6bn over the past decade.In spite of the evidence, Qualcomm exhibits the confidence of the ascendant. Rightly so. The absolute effect on prices to end users is too small to spark consumer outrage and regulators could take years to act. By that time, even the 3G boom may have come and gone.- Click here to add your comments

283;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-05-04T21:31:21Z;Microsoft calls up Qualcomm for smartphone pact;;Microsoft has signed a deal with Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, that will make it easier and quicker to build advanced smartphones running Microsoft Mobile Windows operating system.Under the agreement, which could help Microsoft boost its share of the smartphone operating system market, Qualcomm will build support for the Windows Mobile operating system into its next generation Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chipsets.Microsoft has been putting increasing effort into its attempts to establish Windows Mobile as one of the leading smartphone operating systems alongside rivals such as Symbian, the Palm operating system and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry device platform.The deal with Qualcomm could significantly reduce the time it takes to design and develop a new Windows mobile-powered smartphone, because it will remove much of the custom development work device makers previously undertook to build 3G Windows Mobile devices using Qualcomm chips.As a result, it should help phone makers to develop more affordable, feature-rich Windows Mobile powered phones, while also providing users with extended battery life and enabling them to run a broad range of familiar Windows business and entertainment software applications.“Having support for Windows Mobile on Qualcomm’s MSM chipsets will bring a familiar software experience to the next generation of smaller, lighter phones with more appealing form factors,” said Sanjay Jha, president of Qualcomm’s CDMA technologies division.The new Qualcomm chips supporting Windows Mobile 5.0 are due to begin shipping in the second half of 2006 and are expected to begin appearing in new smartphones next year.Qualcomm is the second-largest mobile chip supplier after Texas Instruments and the leading supplier of chips used in mobile handsets built around CDMA (code division multiple access) technology.After a relatively slow start, demand for Windows Mobile-based smartphones and converged communications devices has been growing strongly over the past 18 months.Today there are 47 device makers shipping Windows Mobile devices with 115 mobile operators in 55 countries. Gartner, the US-based market research firm, estimates that sales of Windows Mobile-based smartphones will reach 64.5 million by 2009.“We know that mobile operators are eager to attract and retain subscribers with an affordable portfolio of Windows Mobile-powered devices,” said Pieter Knook, senior vice-president of Microsoft’s mobile and embedded devices division. “More and more of their customers want capabilities such as mobile e-mail and Office productivity programs in a familiar and easy-to-use software experience.”
284;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-05-03T17:41:15Z;Qualcomm forecast shows strength of mobile market;;Qualcomm, the mobile phone chipmaker, on Wednesday signalled the strength of the handset market as it raised its earnings forecast for the current quarter.The company, the second-largest maker of mobile phone chips after Texas Instruments, said profits of 32-34 cents per share were expected for the quarter ending on June 25, up from its previous prediction of 30 to 32 cents.“The increase in our guidance reflects stronger than expected new orders for our very low-tier chipsets as well as increased demand for 1xEV-DO [3G] chipsets,” said Dr Paul Jacobs, chief executive, ahead of Qualcomm’s analyst meeting in New York today.About 60 per cent of handset sales growth comes from emerging markets, accounting for the strong sales of low-priced chips. US operators are also upgrading services to high-speed wireless such as 1xEV-DO, enabling features such as video streaming and music downloads over phones.On Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported sales of all types of chips rose 7.3 per cent in the first quarter to $59.1bn. But it said the growth was driven by very strong sales of mobile phones, with unit sales up 31 per cent from the first quarter of 2005 and expected to reach 1bn this year.The average semiconductor content of a mobile phone is now about $41 per unit, according to the iSuppli research firm.The SIA said that replacement cycles for phones declining from an average of 26 months to 18 months along with robust demand in China were two factors behind the growth.“China now has approximately 410m cell phone subscribers,” said George Scalise, SIA president. “It is adding new subscribers at the rate of 5m a month, and Chinese consumers appear to be choosing high-end phones with increased functionality.”Qualcomm said its sales for the quarter could be “at or slightly above the high end of prior guidance” of $1.77bn-$1.87bn, a range that represents a 30-38 per cent increase in revenues on a year ago. It said shipments of its Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chips were now expected to be 53m-56m from 50m-53m.The higher earnings numbers inferred higher chipset operating margins, according to UBS analysts, who raised their revenue expectations for the quarter to $1.88bn and earnings by 1 cent a share in a research note.
285;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-05-01T22:57:53Z;Intel strives for new route to domination;;"Twenty years after Intel made a transition that changed the technology industry, the world’s biggest chipmaker is engaged in a soul-searching exercise it says could be of equal importance.In the mid-1980s, faced with strong competition from Japanese manufacturers of D-Ram memory chips, Intel decided to get out of the business and focus instead on making microprocessors, the calculating brains of computers.The decision propelled Intel to domination of the emerging market for personal computers – its processors are still in four out of every five PCs – and its move sounded the death knell for most of the mainframe computer manufacturers that had held sway until then.It was one of those “inflection points”, according to Andy Grove, Intel’s former chief executive, that could lead a business to new heights or signal the beginning of the end.But the comparison by Paul Otellini, the current chief executive, last week of his 90-day strategic review with that turning point of two decades ago, has not rung entirely true with Wall Street. His promise of “the full commitment of the management team to make Intel a different type of company” left some with doubts at Intel’s analyst day in New York.“That would be an old dog learning new tricks. This is not a company or a management team that has been willing to admit they are making mistakes,” says Charlie Glavin, analyst at Needham and Company and a former Intel employee.He says Intel has failed to show the same kind of discipline as its rival Texas Instruments in getting rid of existing businesses that might compromise future growth.Mr Otellini’s comments also suggested contradictions. While he promised “no stone will be left unturned”, he said the company structure of five divisions introduced more than a year ago would remain in place.He predicted slowing PC growth this year – in high single-digits percentage-wise rather than the low double-digits forecast by market research firms – but still insisted Intel’s earnings would make a strong comeback in the second half after two poor quarters. “I think they are overly optimistic; you can’t say PC growth is slowing, but we are going to have our second-best second half ever,” says Mr Glavin.Unlike 20 years ago, Intel is not facing a major challenge from Japan but a nibbling away at its market share by a much smaller Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices.AMD’s success is in part due to Intel’s miscalculations. The NetBurst micro-architecture Intel introduced five years ago was aimed at boosting processor speeds to as much as 10 gigahertz. But the heat the chips produced and the power required was untenable and none ever breached the 4Ghz barrier.More recently, Intel has suffered shortages of the chipsets that accompany its processors and has had to resort to supplies from third parties. Meanwhile, AMD has introduced innovative processors that gave it 27 per cent of the server market in revenue terms in the last quarter, according to Mercury Research.Intel has sought to expand beyond the maturing PC market with its new Digital Home and Digital Health divisions, a Channel Products division dedicated to bringing more affordable PCs to emerging economies and a Mobility division that aims to make inroads into mobile phones.Sumit Dhanda, Bank of America analyst, says there is promise in Digital Home, with Intel predicting $1bn in revenues from its new Viiv brand in its first year.“I also share their optimism on emerging markets: look at mobile handsets, once they hit a certain price-point, adoption turned out to be massive, emerging markets are now where 60 per cent of handsets are sold,” he says.But the sources of savings of $1bn this year and a $300m cut in capital expenditure will not be fully clear until the strategic review is completed in the third quarter."
286;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-04-24T19:39:54Z;Bond issues reveal divide;;The gap between US and European government bond yields has made the euro market more attractive for companies that look to issue subordinated high-yield bonds.Sensata Technologies, the maker of automated sensors and controls, on Friday sold a total of $750m high-yield bonds to refinance part of a $3bn leveraged buyout by Bain Capital. Sensata was previously a part of Texas Instruments, the US technology company.The deal was notable for the mixture of financing, as it was one of the first times a company had issued dual-tranche high-yield bonds in which the subordinated issue was sold to euro investors and the senior un-secured bond was denominated in dollars.“Initially we assumed the dollar market would have strongest appetite for the riskiest piece of debt, which has been the norm in the past,” said Martin Thorneycroft, a high-yield syndicate official at Morgan Stanley, which managed the sale with Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. “What we found was that euro investors were much more interested in the subordinated notes.”Strong demand for senior dollar-denominated paper in the US led the company to change the original set up, which was to issue senior debt in dollars and euros and a junior tranche in dollars.The strong demand for the subordinated bond among European investors highlighted that portfolio managers remain hungry for risk, in spite of calling for higher-quality assets.“In recent months [European] investors have been asking for more BB rated paper, not CCC. But this transaction shows how yield-hungry investors still are,” said Mr Thorneycroft. Moody’s Investors Service rates Sensata’s subordinated debt Caa1 and the senior unsecured debt two notches higher at B2.Sensata issued €245m of 10-year bonds and $450m of notes with an eight-year maturity. Both issues were priced at par and the euro bonds were priced to yield 9 per cent and the dollar issue to yield 8 per cent.The key difference was in the spread over government bonds. The dollar note was priced to pay investors a yield 300 basis points (3 percentage points) more than the 2014 Treasury, which yields about 5 per cent.The subordinated euro bond was priced 509bp above the 10-year Bund, which yields just below 4 per cent.“The difference between European and US government bond yields means a borrower can offer euro investors a higher spread for a junior note but still achieve a cost effective yield in absolute terms,” said Mr Thorneycroft.
287;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-04-21T07:03:48Z;Auto sector leads Tokyo shares higher;;Sharp rises in auto stocks pushed up the Japanese market on Friday, making up for falls in many commodity-related shares.The Nikkei 225 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 17,403.96. The Topix also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,756.40.Carmakers were boosted after JP Morgan began coverage with a ”bullish sector stance”. Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker and JP Morgan’s top pick with an ”overweight” rating, leapt 2.7 per cent to Y6,900. Honda, rated ”overweight” as well, was up 4.6 per cent to Y8,120.Cellphone component makers rose following strong earnings from Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker. Kyocera jumped 3.3 per cent to Y11,500, with Ibiden up 0.7 per cent to Y5,570. They had already been boosted earlier in the week by high earnings from Texas Instruments.Sumitomo Metal Mining, Japan’s biggest gold producer, was down 3.1 per cent to Y1,698 after a sharp drop in gold prices. Declines in other commodity prices hit Toho Zinc, which was down 1.8 per cent to Y1,171, and Dowa Mining, a broad-based commodity producer whose interests include copper and zinc, down 3.4 per cent to Y1,394. Mitsui Mining & Smelting, the nonferrous metal manufacturer, declined 1.6 per cent to Y806.On the eve of the annual results season, which begins in earnest next week, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing dropped 1 per cent to Y2,420 after saying net profit fell 33 per cent in 2005-06 and forecasting another decline in 2006-07.Inpex, the upstream oil company, slid 2.4 per cent to Y1,200,000, hit by a fall in oil prices
288;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-04-19T23:08:16Z;Intel profits drop by a third;;Intel’s profits fell by a third in its first quarter, and gross margins are expected to drop below 50 per cent in its second, as the world’s biggest semiconductor maker struggles in the face of slowing PC growth.Intel’s earnings report, its worst since the bursting of the technology bubble, contrasted sharply with those of Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and that of Texas Instruments a day earlier. The trio of chipmakers is focused on a booming mobile phone market, and reported rising profits.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said Intel believed PC growth rates had “moderated over the course of the past few quarters, leading to slower chip-level inventory reductions at our customers and affecting our revenue in the first half of the year.”He announced revenues of $8.94bn and earnings per share of 23 cents – in line with analyst estimates that had been revised down after Intel issued a revenue warning in March. This compared to sales of $9.43bn a year earlier and profits of 35 cents a share. Intel reported first-quarter gross margins of 55.1 per cent, compared with its expectations in January of 59 per cent. It blamed lower microprocessor revenues and higher inventory write-downs.The company has suffered from its customers not requiring chips they had earlier ordered as demand for personal computers slowed – leading to inventory build-up. It has also been losing market share to its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices.There is worse to come in the current quarter – Intel said revenues were expected to be between $8bn and $8.6bn, below normal seasonal patterns. Gross margins would fall to about 49 per cent as it sold more of its cheaper processors and suffered higher costs. Intel is introducing more powerful and efficient chips based on a new micro-architecture in the coming months. Mr Otellini said the new processors would set the stage for a “strong second half”.However, this will not make up for the poor first-half performance – 2006 revenues are expected to be 3 per cent down on 2005 after a three-year run of double-digit sales growth. Intel shares were nearly 1 per cent higher in after-hours trading at $19.75.Qualcomm reported a 34 per cent rise in revenues year-on-year and an 11 per cent rise in profits.Freescale also reported higher sales and profits, while Texas Instruments had experienced a 42 per cent increase in profits in its first quarter.
289;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Buoyant results give Wall St bulls the upper hand;;Wall Street made further gains on Wednesday after Tuesday’s powerful rally as positive corporate earnings reports from sector bellwethers offset some worries about inflation.Internet stocks led the charge, with Yahoo, up 7.2 per cent at $33.54, recording its biggest one-day advance in two years after the release of first-quarter results.Although earnings fell from a year ago, its shares advanced because its revenues and adjusted earnings met forecasts. UBS raised its price target on the stock from $39 to $42, saying Yahoo’s earnings results were solid across the board and its search results were more than respectable.Solid growth in Yahoo’s online-advertising business boosted expectations for Google’s quarterly earnings, due today. Google shares rose 1.6 per cent to $410.50. Ebay rose 3.8 per cent to $40.35.Higher than expected quarterly earnings from chipmaker Texas Instrument and technology products and service provider United Technologies sparked further optimism for growth in the technology industry. TI shares rose 1.3 per cent to $34.45, having climbed 3.8 per cent in the previous session.United, which was upgraded by Merrill Lynch from “neutral” to “buy” jumped 6.6 per cent to $62.80.Overall it was a strong day for technology stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,370.88.However, gains in the wider market were checked by the release of higher than expected core consumer inflation data for March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a choppy session 0.1 per cent higher at 11,278.77 and the S&P 500 nudged up 0.2 per cent to 1,309.93.The advance came in spite of another spike in oil prices. Crude oil hit new highs after the Energy Department reported a drop in oil and gasoline inventories.The Amex oil index was up 0.9 per cent to 1,163.28.Elsewhere, Allstate led insurers higher after its first-quarter results topped analysts’ expectations as fewer catastrophes and less frequent claims helped increase profit. Wachovia raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”. The stock climbed 5.5 per cent to $54.82.Motorola slumped 6.6 per cent to $22.49 after the mobile phone maker reported a slight dip in first-quarter profit.Amgen reported higher first-quarter earnings, but revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts, pushing shares down 3.8 per cent to $68.30.Coca-Cola, which narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts with its 10 per cent jump in quarterly profit, rose 0.9 per cent to $41.69.JPMorgan Chase, which reported a 36 per cent rise in first-quarter net income, edged up 0.1 per cent to $42.62.Interest in exchange stocks continued after International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, said it was launching its own stock exchange.

15.84 points or 1.2 per cent. The benchmark closed at 1,383.19 on March 24.ASML, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment, jumped 3.5 per cent to €17.40 after it delivered a positive outlook for the coming year and unveiled plans for a €400m share buyback.Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein suggested that ASML’s shares might find support from the fact that orders for the first and second quarters of the year were slightly weak – raising the possibility of orders rising in the second half.But analyst Janardan Menon added that he remained concerned that the semiconductor cycle could peak early in the third quarter, while rising inventories in the first and second quarters could trigger alarm bells in the sector.“We maintain our ‘hold’ recommendation and €17 price target on the stock, while flagging up the possibility of short-term upside,” he said.Elsewhere in the semiconductor sector, Infineon rose 3.3 per cent to €9.05 and STMicroelectronics ended 2 per cent up at €15.20, helped by news of better than expected sales at US rival Texas Instruments.Shares in Philips Electronics fell on Tuesday despite it reporting a reassuring set of figures, but on Tuesday they recovered 4 per cent to reach €27.32.Ericsson came under pressure ahead of the release
of its first-quarter results on Friday after US rival Motorola disappointed investors with its quarterly figures. Richard Windsor,
at Nomura International, said Motorola’s report was a “little worrying” for Ericsson, as he reiterated a “sell” recommendation on the Swedish company’s shares.He warned that even a solid set of results from Ericsson would not mask the valuation issue facing the company’s shares.“Even with the most bullish of expectations for revenues and margins we can still only just reach the current share price,” Mr Windsor said.“We feel that a slowdown in mobile infrastructure will begin to be felt in the second quarter and that expectations may soon begin to slip. The share price looks likely to stagnate in the current range in the best instance.”However, Credit Suisse was more positive.“Despite our expectation of near-term volatility in margins, we note that the outlook for revenues remains strong,” said analyst Kulbinder Garcha.“We would become aggressive buyers on any weakness in the stock due to margin volatility.”Ericsson shares fell 1.7 per cent to SKr28.80.Finnish rival Nokia rose 0.4 per cent to €17.43 ahead of its results, due out today.Software group SAP, which is also scheduled to report today, gained 1.7 per cent to €183.20. Cap Gemini, the computer services company, rose 2.7 per cent to €43.40.ThyssenKrupp put on
4.2 per cent to €25.32 after UBS reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock and upped its price target from €25 to €30.“Despite the recent strong share price rise, we believe the market is still not fully rewarding ThyssenKrupp for internal restructuring initiatives, both in terms of its cost base and portfolio realignment,” said analyst Andrew Snowdowne.He added that he expected the company to report strong first-quarter results on May 12 and believed that management would raise their guidance for the full year.German pharmaceuticals group Schering, the subject of a bid from rival Bayer, edged up 0.3 per cent to €86.29. Schering said it was on track to achieve its 2006 targets after reporting a
4 per cent rise in first-quarter operating profits.European investment banks received a boost from a strong set of quarterly figures from US peer Merrill Lynch.Credit Suisse rose 2.4 per cent to SFr74.90, ING gained 2.4 per cent to €32.04 and BNP Paribas rose 1.6 per cent to €74.05.MAN, the German truckmaker, rose 5.8 per cent to €61.22, off a record high of €61.25, with traders attributing the advance to a positive note from broker Cheuvreux."

The Topix rose 0.3 per cent to 1,747.32.Investors in Japanese exporters took heart from strong US corporate earnings figures and a clear indication from the Federal Reserve that its rate-raising cycle might be near its end.This confidence pushed the electrical machinery sector, for which the US is a key market, up 1.1 per cent. Hitachi, the electronics conglomerate, gained 1.3 per cent to Y863. Kyocera leapt 3.1 per cent to Y11,170, rising along with other makers of mobile phone components following strong profits from Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest maker of wireless chips.

Promise fell 4.1 per cent to Y6,800.
293;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-04-18T14:29:33Z;Wall Street rallies on Fed minutes;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Tuesday as solid company earnings and a clear indication from the Federal Reserve that its rate-raising cycle might be near its end helped overcome worries over rising oil prices.The market jumped after the FOMC issued minutes of its latest meeting in which it said the end to rate rises was “likely to be near”.“The market was caught off guard by the dovish statement,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach. “However, if energy prices continue to go up, the Fed will probably continue with its cycle of monetary tightening.”Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards and Sons, was less concerned about spiralling crude prices.Although oil futures settled at a record high of $71.35, Mr Wren said the fact that the core producer price index only increased by 0.1 per cent in March was evidence that higher energy prices had not led to a more generalised inflation.“It’s wage-pushed inflation the Feds will be looking at,” he said. “Three-dollar gas might slow down consumer spending but that’s going be offset by strong economic growth.”The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.8 per cent, or 194.99 points, at 11,268.77, its biggest point gain in more than two years.The broader S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 1,307.65, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 2 per cent to 2,356.14.The Amex oil index gained 1.9 per cent, with bellwether ExxonMobil up 2.3 per cent at $63.49 and oil service provider Schlumberger up 2.9 per cent at $64.41.Rate-sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders advanced, while Texas Instruments led chipmakers higher with its 3.8 per cent advance to $33.93.The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 3.1 per cent after shedding 1.5 per cent in the previous session.Financials were boosted by Merrill Lynch, which rose 1.2 per cent to $79.38 after the group delivered a record $8bn in quarterly revenue.Wells Fargo also saw first quarter profits rise steeply. The stock gained 0.9 per cent to $65.06.IntercontinentalExchange surged 14.3 per cent to $66.16 after analysts at Bear Stearns initiated coverage on the stock with a favorable rating, citing potential for growth and the exchange’s appeal as a takeover target.Other movers included the internet travel services company Travelzoo.

294;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;AMD moves into Intel’s turf;;Intel’s stranglehold on the computer microprocessor market was loosened further by its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in the first quarter as it reported market-share gains in a new generation of chips.AMD opened the technology hardware earnings season on an optimistic note for the industry, with profits well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations at 38 cents a share, compared with an analyst consensus of 30 cents gathered by Thomson Financial.But its comments did not augur well for erstwhile bellwether Intel, which reports next week along with other major US chipmakers Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Freescale.“AMD had another great quarter,” said Bob Rivet, chief financial officer. “Building on our positive momentum, we believe we once again gained dollar market share based on strong customer demand for AMD64 single and multi-core processors.”The move to computing that addresses 64-bit instead of 32-bit memory and from single-core to dual-core processors has been driving sales for Intel and AMD, which share the market for the dominant “x86” family of microprocessors.In a Merrill Lynch report released last week entitled “Looking into the Q2 Abyss”, semiconductor analyst Joe Osha said Intel’s results next Wednesday would “probably be the worst set of results and forecasts that the company has delivered since the bursting of the bubble”.He cited excess inventory, pricing pressures and AMD’s long-held lead in processor technology for servers as raising short-term and long-term doubts about Intel’s ability to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.AMD shares closed 3 per cent higher at $35.42 in New York and were flat in after-hours trading. Intel’s fell 0.2 per cent to hit a 52-week low of $19.12.Intel still supplies the processors in four out of every five PCs made globally but AMD’s market share has increased significantly of late – rising from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent from the third to fourth quarters of 2005.Last month, Intel issued a first-quarter sales warning, in part blaming further market share loss.
295;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-31T21:31:27Z;Inflation anxiety sparks sell-off in US equities;;Leading US equities lost ground this week as investors fretted over a build-up of inflationary pressure in the world’s largest economy, but still managed to record their strongest first quarter for seven years.Any hopes investors had harboured that the Fed might adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates under the new chairmanship of Ben Bernanke were quashed on Tuesday. The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points and warned further tightening might be necessary to combat inflation.The news sparked an equity sell-off, which was exacerbated on Thursday as an unexpected spike in the quarterly core personal consumption expenditures index – an inflation measure known to be closely scrutinised by the Fed – sent 10-year Treasury yields to their highest level in 22 months.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the biggestleading fallers with utility Exelon falling 3.4 per cent over the week to $52.90, house builder Toll Brothers losing 2 per cent to $34.63, and bank Citigroup easing 1.2 per cent to $47.24.General Motors also weighed on sentiment as it tumbled 6.1 per cent to $22.65. The carmaker’s recent woes continued as its bankrupt parts supplier Delphi said it would seek to end certain supply contracts with GM and disclosures in its annual report prompted Standard & Poor’s to say it might downgrade the company’s credit rating further.There was no respite for investors on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 11,109.40, the S&P 500 eased 0.4 per cent to 1,294.85, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,312.82.Over the week, the S&P fell 0.6 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5 per cent. But for the quarter the two indices both rose more than 4 per cent – their best performance since 1999.However, the Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend this week, rising 1.2 per cent amid increasing demand for technology stocks. The index recorded a 6.4 per cent rise over the quarter, its best performance since the tech bubble burst in 2000.Investors snapped up shares of wireless technology companies this week following Nokia’s upbeat guidance for the mobile phone industry.Nokia said it expected global handset sales to rise 15 per cent this year, up from its previous estimate of 10 per cent. The guidance dovetailed with a note from Cowen & Co. that said the outlook for the handset market was largely positive.NYSE-listed shares of Nokia rose 1.1 per cent to $20.72 over the week. Rival Motorola added 2.6 per cent to 22.91 and Texas Instruments, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips, rose 5.1 per cent to $32.47.Interest in telecommunications stocks was further boosted by the possible merger between telecom equipment maker Lucent and French rival Alcatel. Although Lucent shares were largely unchanged over the five sessions, speculation that more consolidation in the sector might be ahead drove shares of other network equipment makers higher. JDS Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $4.17 and Ciena gained 1.2 per cent to $5.21.Computer makers also performed strongly. Sun Microsystems rose 3.2 per cent to $5.13 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock by two notches from “underweight” to “overweight”. The broker said it believed the company was set to launch a restructuring over the next six months which would give it an significant opportunity to improve its financial performance.Google, which joined the S&P 500 yesterday, saw its shares advanced 6.6 per cent to $390.00 as index fund managers added the stock to their portfolios.Apple Computer, meanwhile, rose 4.6 per cent to $62.72 this week on expectations that the delay of Microsoft’s forthcoming Vista operating system would boost sales of the group’s Macintosh computers during the crucial holiday sales-fuelled fourth quarter.Elsewhere, Surging metal prices boosted aluminium producers Alcoa and Alcan, pushing their shares up 2.4 per cent to $30.56, and 0.9 per cent to $45.73, respectively. Copper producer Phelps Dodge, up 7.2 per cent to $80.53, was given an extra lift after Morgan Stanley upgraded its recommendation on the stock from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.
296;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-30T21:38:57Z;Wall Street retreats as bond yields rise;;Technology stocks remained in focus on Thursday as Nokia’s upbeat outlook on the mobile phone industry sparked buying of wireless telecommunications shares.Nokia said it expected global handset sales to rise 15 per cent this year, up from its previous estimate of 10 per cent. The guidance dovetailed with a broker’s note on Wednesday from Cowen & Co. that said the outlook for the handset market was largely positive.NYSE shares of Nokia jumped 5.2 per cent to $21.28. Rival Motorola added 0.8 per cent to $22.96 and Texas Instruments, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips, rose 3.4 per cent to $33.08.The gains were enough to help the Nasdaq Composite build on its multi-year peak. The technology-heavy index closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,340.82, while the broader S&P 500 gave up early gains to trade 0.2 per cent lower at 1,300.25.The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6 per cent to 11,150.70 as rate-sensitive stocks such as financials, homebuilders and retailers were held back by rates concerns.Also weighing on the Dow was General Motors, which continued to lose momentum in spite of reports that it was edging closer to a deal to sell a majority stake in GMAC, its finance arm. GM, which was also in talks to sell its shares in Japan’s Isuzu Motors, fell 4.9 per cent to $21.06.General Electric was among the few rising blue chips, rising 2.1 per cent to $34.65 after Morgan Stanley upped its price target on the stock, saying the share price could double within the next three years.Elsewhere, a rise in long-dated bond yields weighed heavily on utility stocks. The Dow Jones Utility Average fell 1.1 per cent, led by Texas Utilities’ 2.5 per cent decline to $45.64.Metal and mining companies received a boost however from Morgan Stanley, which raised its metals price forecasts and said rising replacement costs would keep driving prices higher in the long term.Miner Phelps Dodge climbed 5.8 per cent to $81.48 after the broker upgraded its recommendation on the stock one notch to “overweight”. Earnings upgrades also helped aluminium producer Alcan, up 0.4 per cent to $46.73.Google, which is joining the S&P 500 today, said it would issue 5.3m additional shares to meet the demands of S&P 500 index funds. Shares of Google, up 15.5 per cent since last Thursday, when Standard & Poor’s announced the internet search engine’s addition to its benchmark index, fell 1.7 per cent to $388.44.Bank of New York jumped 4.4 per cent to $35.92 on reports it was to sell 300 retail branches to JPMorgan Chase as part of its strategy to exit the sector and focus on institutional accounts.Elsewhere, news that the Nasdaq Stock Market had dropped its $4.2bn bid for the London Stock Exchange pushed shares in the exchange 4.2 per cent lower to $40.11.
297;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-10T21:32:40Z;Inflation worries prey on Wall Street sentiment;;US equities put in a mixed performance this week amid fears about a build-up of inflationary pressure in the world’s largest economy.Worries that the Federal Reserve might extend its current cycle of interest rate rises pushed yields on 10-year Treasury bonds to their highest level for 21 months early in the week. This depressed share prices as investors focused on the impact of higher borrowing costs on corporate profits.Friday’s employment data offered the market some respite, however. Although US job creation in February grew at a faster pace than predicted, investors shrugged off fears of possible wage-induced inflation, preferring to focus on the implications for economic growth.“The employment report should be seen as broadly neutral, with the slightly stronger than expected increase in payrolls broadly offset by the tick upwards in the unemployment rate,“ said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. “With productivity still increasing and wages still not rising in real terms, the Fed shouldn’t be unduly worried by this.”By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1 per cent at 11.076.34, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,281.58 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,262.04.The rally took the weekly gains on the Dow to 0.5 per cent, although the S&P was still off 0.4 per cent and Nasdaq down 1.8 per cent.The technology sector was the hardest hit, with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, falling 2.3 per cent to $19.85, Advanced Micro Devices shedding 7.3 per cent to $36.63 and National Semiconductoroff 7.6 per cent at $27.12.“Technology stocks fell because they are the quintessential growth cyclicals,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Elsewhere in the sector, Texas Instruments lost 4.7 per cent to $30.77 after the world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips failed to deliver the strong earnings outlook some investors were hoping for. Shares in Google, the world’s most-used internet search engine, fell 10.8 per cent to $337.50 after the company urged investors to ignore a financial forecast unwittingly posted on its website.The week also saw a renewed upswing in merger and acquisition activity, including AT&T’s $67bn move for BellSouth.The deal, which would make AT&T the largest telecommunications company in the world, prompted speculation that more consolidation in the sector could be on the horizon as wireless, cable and conventional phone companies look for ways to counter AT&T’s newfound dominance.Verizon, the second largest US carrier, gained 1.8 per cent to $34.19 on the week, while Alltel and Sprint Nextel, widely seen as a potential takeover target for Verizon, climbed 2 per cent to $65.60 and 4.8 per cent to $25.37 respectively.AT&T shares ended the week 2.7 per cent lower at $27.16 while BellSouth, which was upgraded by Bear Stearns, surged 9.2 per cent to $34.35 over the five sessions.Meanwhile, Blackstone Group’s $5.6bn deal to acquire CarrAmerica Realty showed that rising interest rates have done little to damp interest in real estate investment trusts. Carr-America ended the week up 7.8 per cent at $44.30.General Motors was the top performing stock on both the Dow and the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $21.64.Its shares were lifted by a combination of positive factors, including reports it was near an agreement with the United Auto Workers union to cut labour costs.The NYSE Group received a warm welcome this week as trading got underway in the company formed from the New York Stock Exchange’s merger with Archipelago Holdings. The stock ended its first session up nearly 25 per cent. However, profit-taking eroded some of its gains and the stock ended the week 11.3 per cent higher at $74.55.
298;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-08T06:25:58Z;Tokyo shares lower ahead of BoJ decision;;Falls in domestic, export and oil stocks ahead of a major decision by the Bank of Japan sent Tokyo share indices down on Wednesday. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 15,627.49. The Topix fell 0.8 per cent to 1,605.58.The stock market in general was hit by nervousness ahead of the Bank of Japan’s decision on Thursday. Many analysts expect it to announce an end to quantitative monetary easing. This would clear the way for the bank to raise interest rates but the market is collectively undecided about whether higher rates are good or bad for Japanese shares. It is also unclear whether an end to quantitative easing will be followed by higher interest rates in the foreseeable future.Banking, one of the most important domestic sectors, was down 1 per cent. Mitsubishi UFJ, the world’s biggest bank by assets, fell 1.2 per cent to Y1,650,000.A forecast from Texas Instruments that disappointed investors sent chip-related stocks lower. Advantest, the world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, fell 1.9 per cent to Y12,860.Investors continued to adjust their positions in companies in the wake of UK mobile phone operator Vodafone’s news that it was selling its Japanese arm to Softbank, the internet conglomerate. Softbank fell a further 2.5 per cent to Y3,060 – adding to Tuesday’s sharp fall. NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s biggest mobile operator, was down 1.8 per cent to Y167,000 but its rival KDDI rose 2.1 per cent to Y575,000.Upstream oil companies fell as the crude oil price failed to recover recent losses. Teikoku Oil slid 4.5 per cent to Y1,495, with Inpex also down 4.5 per cent to Y1,050,000Real estate rose, boosted by a note from Goldman Sachs predicting share prices would be driven forward by a strong national land price survey in late March. Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s biggest property company, closed 2.7 per cent higher at Y2,475. Mitsubishi Estate, its largest rival, was 2.5 per cent higher at Y2,475. Sumitomo Realty & Development jumped 3.1 per cent to Y2,700.In the midst of uncertainty ahead of the Bank of Japan’s announcement, pharmaceuticals – classic defensive stocks – performed well. Takeda, Japan’s biggest drugmaker, rose 2 per cent to Y6,660. Chugai Pharmaceutical jumped 5 per cent to Y2,315 after JP Morgan raised it to “overweight” from “neutral”. JP Morgan cited the company’s ”relatively limited exposure to generic competition”.
299;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-07T19:22:00Z;Interest rate fears put squeeze on US equities;;A disappointing forecast by technology bellwether Texas Instruments, combined with fears about the outlook for US interest rates, sent equities broadly lower on Tuesday.Yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond remained close to nine-month highs, raising worries about the effect of higher borrowing costs on corporate profit.The uncertainty in the market was exacerbated by a government report showing falling US productivity in the fourth quarter, the first decline in more than four years, and an increase in labour costs.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,268.38 and the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent weaker at 1,275.88.But the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a rise of 0.2 per cent to 10,980.69, boosted by a rally from General Motors after the auto giant announced plans to reduce employee retirement benefits as part of a move to cut labour costs.GM shares rose 2.4 per cent to $20.29.The biggest drag on the S&P 500 was Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, which lost 3.3 per cent to $31.26.The company raised the lower end of its profit forecast but failed to deliver the strong earnings outlook some investors were looking for.However, analysts at Wachovia Securities reiterated their “outperform” rating, saying that TI was their favourite large-cap stock.“Despite near-term concerns, we believe business fundamentals remain sound,” they said.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker that last week cut its revenue estimates, fell 1.2 per cent to $20.06.The telecoms sector was in focus as analysts digested the fallout from AT&T’s takeover approach for BellSouth, which would make it the biggest telecoms company in the world.Qwest Communications International fell 6.7 per cent to $6.38 after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock from “hold” to “sell”, saying an approach for the fixed-line operator – widely seen as a potential target for Verizon, the second-largest US carrier – was unlikely.Shares in Verizon fell 0.7 per cent to $33.51 amid reports the company was looking to buy Vodafone’s 45 per cent stake in the telecoms groups’ Verizon Wireless joint venture.Kroger put on 1.4 per cent to $20.15 after the largest supermarket operator in the US swung into a fourth-quarter profit.Archipelago, the electronic trading systems operator, whose shares have risen over 30 per cent this year, fell 4.3 per cent to $64.25 on the last day of trading before its merger with the New York Stock Exchange.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average however, fell 0.4 per cent to 11,021.59, while the S&P 500 stood at 1,287.23, a 0.2 per cent fall on the week.Semiconductor stocks led the gains on the Nasdaq, in spite of yesterday’s warning from sector leader Intel, that its first-quarter gross margins would be hit by lower-than-expected revenue. Intel’s shares, which fell by as much as 2.3 per cent yesterday, ended the week down 0.2 per cent at $20.32.National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices were lifted after Mark Edelstone from Morgan Stanley said he expected positive earnings surprises from both companies.National, he said, would benefit from strong seasonal demand for mobile phones, while AMD had increased its penetration into the server and PC markets. Shares in National gained 7.7 per cent over the week to $29.34, but AMD reversed early gains to finish 2.5 per cent lower at $39.51.Altera climbed 5.9 per cent to $20.89 after Bear Stearns raised its rating to “outperform” from “peer perform”, and Texas Instruments added 8.8 per cent to $32.29 after Goldman Sachs said it expected the company to raise its financial outlook at its update on Monday.Google’s fortunes this week hinged on the company’s prospects for growth, and confidence took an early knock when chief financial officer George Reyes said on Tuesday there were signs it was slowing.The shares fell more than 7 per cent on the day, but recovered steadily over
the week as the damage control statements rolled out. “We still see significant opportunities to improve monetisation,” the company said just hours after the CFO’s comments.At its second annual analyst day on Thursday, Google described a robust growth outlook, which convinced several brokers. Citigroup “came away incrementally more positive” and re-iterated its “buy” rating and price target of $490. Lehman maintained its “overweight” rating, saying it was positive on short- and long-term prospects.The shares ended the week 0.2 per cent higher at $378.18.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the market had held up well in light of the turmoil in the technology sector.“Despite the non-bullish news we saw this week, the market has not given up much ground from its highs last week,” he said. “I have not had much of an occasion to be short-term bullish over the last six months, but that is changing now. I believe we will see the market press on.”Higher crude prices, pushed up by lingering concerns about supply disruption in Iran and Nigeria, made energy stocks one of the best performing industry group on the S&P 500 this week. Oil-field service provider Schlumberger climbed 3.2 per cent to $122.22 while drilling rig operator Noble jumped 6.1 per cent to $78.6.Rising energy prices also helped propel natural gas producer Chesapeake Energyinto the S&P 500 index this week.Chesapeake, whose market value more than doubled last year on strong gas prices, replaced car parts maker Dana, which filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday after it failed to make a $21m bond payment.Shares in Chesapeake ended the week 5 per cent higher at $31.51 while Dana plunged more than 56 per cent to $0.66.Financial stocks were under pressure this week as investors took profit following renewed concern over the prospect of further interest rate rises.Companies with significant lending operations were hit. Wells Fargo fell 1.2 per cent to $63.82 and Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $45.92, while mortgage financier Fannie Mae dropped 2.8 per cent to $54.52. Wachovia, which was downgraded by Morgan Stanley on valuation concerns, fell 4.3 per cent to $55.16.AK Steel, which surged 23.4 per cent yesterday after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported the company was in talks to be acquired by US Steel. On the week, AK was 21 per cent higher at $13.99, while US Steel shares gained 0.4 per cent to $57.98.Networking software maker Novell fell 18.3 per cent to $7.90 after its profit guidance for the second quarter fell short of market estimates."
301;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-03T20:30:13Z;Intel loses market share to AMD;;Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, on Friday disappointed the market for the second time in six weeks with its sales figures, blaming weaker demand for its processors and market share loss to AMD, its biggest rival.Intel, which has abandoned its practice of mid-quarter updates, issued a revenue warning, predicting sales of $8.7bn-$9.1bn in the first quarter, down from the $9.1bn-$9.7bn it forecast in January.The group said then that the mid-point of $9.4bn represented a decline of 8 per cent over the fourth quarter – 3 percentage points more than was seasonally normal.Intel said the revised forecast was “primarily due to weaker than expected demand and a slight market segment share loss”.Its shares were down 1.8 per cent at $20.12 at noon in New York and have fallen about 20 per cent this year, after fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. Intel, which is seen as a bellwether stock, led the US market slightly lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.06 per cent.“It’s a surprise, they are obviously in trouble with [market] share and are seeing weakening PC demand, which is worrying for the rest of the market,” said Apjit Walia, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.However, Intel’s problems were not mirrored in the fourth-quarter results of other semiconductor companies. In particular, AMD reported a 35 per cent increase in sales over the previous quarter, with its share of the “x86” processor market rising from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent. Intel has all but about 1 per cent of the rest of that market.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, had reported a tough December and this appears to have continued into January. Intel, whose customers have been suffering from a shortage of the chipsets that accompany its processors, has been forced to turn to third-party suppliers to meet demand.Mr Walia said he expected aggressive pricing from Intel in the next two quarters as it tried to reclaim market share from AMD.This would hit margins and Intel said on Friday that it expected first-quarter gross margin percentage to be “adversely impacted” by the change in revenues. It was already expected to fall 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter to 59 per cent.More clues to the health of the chip industry will be supplied in Texas Instruments’ mid-quarter update on Monday.
302;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-03-01T21:47:45Z;Wall Street climbs as chip sector rallies;;"Wall Street climbed on Wednesday as Google, which drove Tuesday’s sharp sell-off, recovered some poise, while semiconductor stocks gained after broker upgrades.Strategists were surprised by Google’s statement on slowing growth on Tuesday, coming in advance of today’s analysts’ day, but remained unperturbed in spite of that session’s 7 per cent fall.“We continue to see the best opportunities for Google as display advertising, international expansion and classified advertising,” said Mark Mahaney at Citigroup, reiterating a “buy” rating and $490 price target.Merrill Lynch, the bank at which Tuesday’s comments were made, said: “Growth at Google continues to remain very strong, but looking ahead, tension between top-line growth and margin pressure could keep the stock trading within a range near term, keeping us neutral.”Google shares added 0.6 per cent to $364.80.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6 per cent higher at 11,053.53. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent to 2,314.64, while the S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent to 1,291.24.Semiconductors put in the best sectoral performance after several upbeat offerings from brokers. National Semiconductor gained 5.1 per cent to $29.47 after Mark Edelstone, at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target, saying seasonally solid mobile phone demand and higher margins would drive a positive earnings surprise.The broker was also upbeat about Advanced Micro Devices, as the company “increased its penetration into the enterprise server and PC markets”. AMD climbed 3.6 per cent to $40.07.Bear Stearns upgraded Altera to “outperform” from “peer perform”, citing, among other factors, attractive valuation and healthy communications spending for 2006. The stock gained
5.7 per cent to $21.18.Texas Instruments completed a chip-making quartet to benefit from broker notes after Goldman Sachs said it expected the company to raise its financial outlook at its update next Monday. Shares rose 7.8 per cent to $32.18.Dow constituent Hewlett-Packard rose 3.8 per cent to $34.05 after it reached a deal over patent litigation with Gateway.Brown Forman, maker of Jack Daniel’s whiskey, gained 7.4 per cent to $76.71 after it said fiscal third-quarter net profit rose 13 per cent, beating estimates, thanks to sales growth in the US and Europe.Crude prices crept higher, pushing Sunoco 2.9 per cent to $76.21, and Valero Energy 2.1 per cent to $54.94. Chesapeake Energy, the second-biggest US supplier of natural gas, continued to trade higher on its impending entry to the S&P 500 index, adding 2.5 per cent to $30.43.AutoDesk, design software maker, was up 10.7 per cent to $41.68 after it reported unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter earnings and raised forecasts for 2007."
303;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-02-21T22:36:40Z;Wall Street falls on US interest-rate concerns;;Wall Street fell on Tuesday as strong results from the retail sector, rising oil prices and better-than-forecast economic data fuelled inflationary fears and expectations of more aggressive interest rate increases.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent at 11,069.06, while the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9 per cent at 2,262.49.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, fell 1.1 per cent to $45.74 in spite of a forecast-beating 13.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings as its outlook statement fell shy of expectations.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was little changed at $41.87 after it also unveiled better-than-expected results that included a 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by revenue growth across all divisions.Meanwhile, RadioShack, the troubled electronics retailer, reversed early gains and fell 0.4 per cent to $19 after a 62 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. Some strategists felt there was value in the stock, however, following the resignation of David Edmondson, chief executive.“We believe there is so much bad news priced in at this point, that disappointing near-term results will be discounted in anticipation of improvements from new management,” said David Strasser, at Bank of America, upgrading the stock from “sell” to “neutral”.Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said its acquisition of May Department Stores in August had helped drive a 59 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, while a tax settlement also helped boost earnings. The results, however, fell a little short of expectations and the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $70.40.Following the earnings-driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock and the computer hardware sector. HP shares were down 4.6 per cent to $32.51, while sector peers Dell and Apple fell 1.9 per cent to $29.81 and 1.7 per cent to $69.08 respectively.This weakness permeated the wider technology sector. Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $30.65, while rival Broadcom slid 2.8 per cent to $65.99 and Applied Materials lost 2.2 per cent to $19.29.Carnival, the cruise operator, was down 3.2 per cent to $51.83 after Credit Suisse cut its rating to “neutral” from “outperform” as it expected weaker-than-forecast peak season bookings and higher promotional costs.Oil stocks were among the biggest gainers after a rise in crude prices. Among them, ConocoPhillips added 2.9 per cent to $62.83 while Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, climbed 6.3 per cent to $72.85.On the data front, the Conference Board’s leading indicators, an index of 10 components including jobless claims and factory orders, rose for the fourth-successive month, suggesting robust economic growth.
304;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-01-23T23:26:28Z;Alliance formed to promote mobile TV;;Nokia, Intel, Motorola and other wireless equipment makers have formed an alliance to promote an emerging technology standard for delivering live TV to mobile phones.The partners said they would work together to develop and spread the use of DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld) – an open standard for broadcasting TV on wireless equipment – through a group dubbed the Mobile DTV Alliance.Texas Instruments and Crown Castle International, the US cell tower operator that is building a DVB-H network in the US, are also members of the alliance.The formation of the alliance represents a serious challenge for Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, that is backing a rival proprietary technology called Media Flow.DVB-H and Media Flow technologies will enable mobile carriers to provide video content to subscribers without overloading their 3G wireless networks.Mobile operators and video content providers in the US and elsewhere hope that delivering mobile TV and other video content to mobile phones will provide them with a new revenue stream. In the US, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which operate 3G networks based on Qualcomm’s CDMA technology, are expected to adopt Media Flow. Mobile carriers in Australia,Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and UShave been testing DVB-H technology.
305;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;TI profits hit top end of forecasts;;Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, announced fourth-quarter profits at the top end of expectations but revenues that stayed flat as semiconductor growth was offset by a seasonal decline in its calculator business.TI reported fourth-quarter earnings of 40 cents a share after 3 cents of stock-based compensation expenses, compared with its guidance of 38 to 40 cents in December and analyst expectations of 39 cents.Revenues of $3.59bn were at the lower end of its predicted range of $3.56bn-$3.73bn and below market consensus of $3.64bn surveyed by Thomson Financial. They were up 14 per cent on a year ago but were even compared with the previous quarter.TI said semiconductor growth had accelerated over the past year and sales rose 3 per cent in the third quarter to $3.23bn, representing 90 per cent of total revenues. It said demand was focused on its digital signal processors (DSPs) and analogue chips used in mobile phones and consumer electronics.Rich Templeton, chief executive, said TI had achieved its goal in 2005 of $1bn-plus in revenues for chips supplied for next-generation cellphones. Total sales for the year were a record $13.39bn, up 6 per cent on 2004, and operating margins hit a new high of 20.8 per cent. Sales for its Educational and Productivity Solutions division were $67m – down $110m on the previous quarter and $13m on a year previously. TI blamed a seasonal decline for graphing calculators and tighter inventory management at retail customers.Sensors and Controls sales were $302m, up $22m on the third quarter and $25m on the fourth quarter of 2004, due to higher demand for its sensor products.TI expects to complete the $3bn sale of the division to Bain Capital, announced earlier this month, in the first half of this year.TI shares were down 3 per cent in extended trading in New York at $30.74.
306;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-01-12T13:45:13Z;Lex: US technology M&A;;"Are the stars aligning for an uptick in technology mergers and acquisitions? Quite possibly. There are a number of reasons why 2006 could shine brightly.One catalyst is the increasing predictability of technology businesses as they mature. That has prompted private equity houses – flush with cash – to scour the sector for opportunities. Recent deals include this week’s $3bn purchase of Texas Instruments’ controls business.Second, deals are a way for maturing strategic buyers to access new growth opportunities. The consumer market is currently attractive – Cisco’s recent acquisition of set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta improves its position for selling to consumers. On the corporate side, meanwhile, big customers want to reduce the number of suppliers they deal with, giving an incentive for consolidation. Oracle’s takeovers of PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems gave its enterprise software business critical mass – to go alongside its core database offering – while providing big opportunities to cut costs.Finally, the fast-growing internet sector should remain hot for smaller deals. As Cisco once did in networking, companies such as Yahoo are using highly-rated paper or cash to buy young companies – almost like placing venture capital bets on new ideas or technologies. The acquired businesses have a better chance of success because they gain immediate access to the heavy internet traffic of an established site. Also, they cannot become serious competitors to the acquirer. Ebay’s acquisition of Skype, at up to $4.1bn, was bigger and more aggressively priced than most, but is a brave bet that Skype’s peer-to-peer telecoms service will mushroom within the auction giant’s system. Media companies are also keen to buy into the fast-growing sector.One potentially decisive factor for deals could be an increased willingness of technology companies to use cash piles or even gear up their balance sheets. The maturing sector makes valuations more predictable for strategic bidders and encourages deals motivated by cost-cutting. Availability of cash is not a good reason to make an acquisition. But some companies may prefer spending their money trying to boost growth prospects, rather than being forced to return it to shareholders.- Click here to add your comments

307;TXN;Texas Instruments;2006-01-09T20:01:42Z;TI sells S&C unit to Bain for $3bn;;Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, on Monday announced the sale of its Sensors & Controls business to Bain Capital, the private equity company, for $3bn in cash.The move was not unexpected – analysts have described S&C as lower-growth and non-core, while private equity has been growing more interested in tech businesses that generate strong, steady cash flow.S&C, acquired by TI in 1959, has about 5,400 employees and achieved $1.1bn in 2004 sales of its sensors and thermostats that monitor systems in household appliances, cars, trucks and aircraft and pressure levels in air conditioners. This represents about 8 per cent of TI’s total revenues and the division has been growing at about 7 per cent a year over the past three years, compared with 17 per cent for TI as a whole.Kevin March, TI chief financial officer, told the FT it seemed an appropriate time to sell the division with profitability of TI’s semiconductors overtaking that of S&C in the third quarter. “This lets us focus on growth and unlocks value for S&C, which won’t have to compete for resources within TI any more.”TI said it had no immediate plans for the cash generated.The acquisition of S&C is the latest in a string of private equity deals in the tech industry.Among the large US private equity firms, Bain has been among the most aggressive in pursuing such deals. In 2004, it participated in the $2bn purchase of Electronic Data Systems’ UGS-PLM software unit, which is now gearing up for an initial public offering.Last year, Bain was one of seven firms that acquired SunGard Data Systems for $11.3bn, the largest ever technology buy-out.Bain is also considering buying Affiliated Computer Services for about $8bn, alongside Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group, in a deal that is expected to be announced in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.Steve Zide, a managing director at Bain, told the FT: “The financing markets have been very receptive to tech transactions, also, thanks to the positive outlook that investors have about tech businesses as a whole.”Bain will be writing a cheque worth $1bn in the deal, with the remaining $2bn being financed through debt. The purchase price values S&C at 10-11 times ebitda – higher than most analysts were expecting.JPMorgan Chase advised Bain. TI, which ran an auction to sell the business, was advised by Morgan Stanley.
308;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Chipmakers lead way in new digital revolution;;Intel, the biggest maker of semiconductors, has given many of its processors names that recall base metals – such as Itanium and Pentium – as the slivers of silicon have become the hot inner core of millions of computers.But with the promotion of its new Viiv (which rhymes with “five”) brand at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, as well as the retirement of its “Intel Inside” logo, the company is leading a charge by chipmakers out of the confines of the PC and into the digital home.Chipmakers are set to benefit as high-definition televisions and entertainment centres become dependent on computer chips tuned to multimedia uses.While Intel has Viiv, its biggest processor rival AMD is on Wednesday chiming in with similar-sounding AMD Live!, while Texas Instruments will be pushing its DLP television technology and Da Vinci multimedia chips.Effective branding strategies will be key to their success in a world where Sony or Samsung is synonymous with stylish devices for the home.“Viiv is a departure for Intel,” says David Placek, whose company Lexicon Branding came up with the new name.“It still has a feeling of something elemental, but it reflects a leader moving to a different level that is now more human – there is a vitality and a vibrance in Viiv.“With the digital world becoming completely integrated with our lives, we believe Viiv, with its simplicity and aliveness, will be quite easy for consumers to embrace as part of their digital life.”But Intel may find the established players in consumer electronics less welcoming and even unwilling to have the Viiv badge displayed alongside their own brand.The chipmaker has adopted a separate strategy to win over the industry, based on its standards-setting work in the PC world, where it has championed innovations such as USB (Universal Serial Bus) connectivity.“In the living room, there’s a real problem of a proliferation of devices that do not interface with one another – how do you hook them up and share content?” asks Eric Kim, Intel’s chief marketing officer and former head of marketing for Samsung.The Viiv brand, he argues, will assure users of interoperability as content is exchanged between devices made by different manufacturers and Intel is in a unique position to help the consumer electronics industry achieve this.“I come from Samsung and it could clearly not do this for Sony or Philips or Panasonic, so there’s a real need for an industry third-party player that can provide leadership on interoperability,” Mr Kim says.Viiv will provide a platform of dual-core processors and chipsets designed to speed the handling of multimedia files in different formats and reproduce them in high-definition video and surround sound. It is appearing first in PC-like devices running Microsoft’s Windows Media Center software and AMD is developing its new Live! platform as an alternative for buyers of Media Center devices.Lacking the resources of its much larger rival, it will not launch a marketing blitz and will seek partnerships.“We are not trying to displace the devices that are already in the living room, we have a more collaborative approach,” says Hal Speed, marketing architect at AMD.“We are trying to bring together the best of both worlds, with partners such as set-top box makers where we can help combine the broadcast world with what comes over the broadband network.”TI made earlier inroads into consumer electronics with the DSP (digital signal processor) chips that it specialises in proving to be an ideal solution for many manufacturers wanting fast processing of multimedia content. It has innovated with its DLP (Digital Light Processing) technology offering an alternative to LCD and Plasma televisions.At CES, TI is likely to be pushing its Da Vinci multimedia chips, although the brand is more likely to be seen on an inner circuit board than on the outside of a product.“Our aim is to work with our customers and we don’t see any advantage to the customer in putting the TI name on the outside,” says Doug Rasor, head of TI’s worldwide strategic marketing.He warns: “I think Intel is going to have a hard time getting much traction with that strategy in the consumer space. It’s different from the PC world – in consumer electronics, you have to earn your business one customer relationship at a time.”
309;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-19T22:22:05Z;Wall St skids as nervous investors take profits;;Stocks fell for a third consecutive day on Monday as traders took profit at the expense of technology stocks and industrial blue chips.The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 29.74 points, or 1.2 per cent – its biggest one-day loss in almost 2 months.The decline was led by semiconductor stocks, which fell after brokerage Stifel Nicolaus cut its rating on six stocks in the sector, saying the market had already taken into account most of the industry’s strengths.Overall the Amex semiconductor index shed 2.3 per cent with chip giants Intel down 2.3 per cent at $25.78 and Texas Instruments down 3.1 per cent at $32.03.Meanwhile, sharp gains in the pharmaceutical sector failed to keep the other two indices afloat. A 4.7 per cent drop in Caterpillar and a 3.8 per cent pullback in General Motors forced the Dow Jones Industrial Average to reverse earlier gains and end the session 0.4 per cent, or 39.22 points, lower at 10,836.37.The broader S&P 500 dropped 0.6 per cent, or 7.40 points, to 1,259.92.Some analysts said the poor trading session was an indication that the year-end rally had run its course. However, there were others who argued that the market was still in the consolidating phrase following its huge rally in November.“You have to put the declines in perspective,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons. “This bull market has been going on for 38 months and it can’t continue to rock and roll day in and day out like it used to when the it was young and had lots of energy.”“This does not mean it’s going to die, but it justifies the indices having a longer period of R&R,” he added. “That said, a day or two more days like this, then that’s going to seriously affect my sleeping pattern.”Among the gainers, Pfizer surged 7.7 per cent to $24.32 after it won a key court ruling blocking generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol treatment. Under the ruling, generic versions of Pfizer’s drug are blocked until 2011, giving the company time to develop new moneymaking products.The news sent shares in fellow drugmaker Merck 7.5 per cent higher to $32.25 while Johnson & Johnson gained 2.1 per cent to $61.19.Bristol Myers and Forest Labs, companies that are also involved in patent disputes, traded higher too. Bristol climbed 2.3 per cent to $22.53 and Forest Labs rose 1.7 per cent to $41.81.On the Nasdaq, not even Google could buck the falling trend.Shares in the internet search engine skidded 1.3 per cent to $426.60 after having risen 1.4 per cent on reports that it was in talks with Time Warner to buy a 5 per cent stake in the company’s AOL division for $1bn.The deal would widen the existing advertising tie-up between the two companies while preventing Microsoft from getting a lift in the search advertisements market.Both Time Warner and Microsoft dipped 0.3 per cent, to $17.95 and $26.83 respectively.News that Cablevision Systems was cancelling last week’s $1bn bond sale sent shares in the multimedia service provider tumbling 3.5 per cent to $23.15. The new bonds would have breached covenants in its existing borrowings.The money from the sale was to have been used to pay a special $3bn dividend to stockholders.On the retail front, Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, surged 5.9 per cent to $22.51 after it swung into a third-quarter profit.Its rival Radioshack fell 4.6 per cent to $21.17 after Bank of America slashed its rating.Elsewhere, FPL Group confirmed plans to buy Constellation Energy in a deal valued at $11bn. FPL edged down 0.4 per cent to $42.76 while Constellation dropped 4.1 per cent to $59.10.
310;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-15T05:26:57Z;Intel to announce venture with BMW;;Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will on Thursday announce a wide- ranging partnership with the carmaker BMW, ranging from support for its Formula One racing team to co-operation on standards for in-car equipment.The deal represents the biggest example so far of chipmakers’ identification with fast cars and shows how they are competing to provide more sophisticated components for the automotive industry.Since 2002, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s biggest processor rival, has been a technology partner of Ferrari, a team that has since won three championships and 38 grand prixs. It is also technology partner for world motorsport’s governing body, the FIA, and the US’s Nascar organisation.Infineon, the German chipmaker, has paid to have a Nascar racetrack named after it in California and Texas Instruments sponsors a leading Nascar racing team.Intel said its technology would be deployed throughout the BMW Group and its worldwide dealer network. BMW would convert its corporate notebooks to those based on Intel’s Centrino processor and would work with Intel on an industry specification that would allow devices such as phones and portable media players to work with BMW vehicles.“Intel has a proven track record for establishing standards for markets and car infotainment is another major opportunity,” Eric Kim, Intel chief marketing officer, told the FT.“Larger enterprises are coming to the conclusion now that it is better to standardise on a common technology foundation. We think more and more companies will be taking BMW’s path.”Intel’s sponsorship of the Toyota Formula 1 team expires at the end of the month and there had been rumours for months that it would partner with the more successful McLaren team.But it will instead be the partner for BMW’s newly acquired Sauber team, replacing AMD, which is providing more than 500 of its Opteron processors for a supercomputer that analyses wind-tunnel results for streamlining the design of cars.“It will be interesting to see how they move forward with that,” said Morris Denton, AMD corporate marketing vice-president. “It’s not that simple to replace a supercomputer or the processors in it.”“We have existing relationships with a variety of the teams, so there are opportunities for our competitor to come in and do some [technology partnerships], we look forward to the competition.”
311;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-13T18:48:15Z;Simon London: Dust off those dancing shoes;;Market leaders should have all the advantages: resources, relationships, market power. So why do they rarely outperform for more than a few years? There is no more pressing strategic issue in the corridors of corporate America.Just ask senior executives at International Business Machines, Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Wal-Mart, General Electric or General Motors – market leaders whose stock prices are lower today than they were at the start of the decade.To be sure, it is not a new question. Almost as soon as Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy hit the shelves in 1980, it became clear that the Harvard Business School Wunderkind did not have all the answers. Market-leading companies such as Xerox, Digital Equipment Corporation and Texas Instruments – which looked impregnable when judged against Prof Porter’s “five forces” framework – were already struggling. Often they were embarrassed by competitors with fewer resources, inferior technology and less market power.Attempts to explain what was going on spawned such excellent books as Richard Foster’s Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage (1986), Richard Tanner Pascale’s Managing on the Edge (1989), Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad’s Competing for the Future (1994) and Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma (1997). From this decade or more of field work and theorising emerged two main themes.First, sustained corporate success is the exception. Very few companies return to growth once they have lost the momentum that propelled them to the top. Prof Christensen has since estimated that only about one in 10 large companies outperform the equity market over a decade or more, confirming that market leadership is less of a competitive advantage than you might think.Second, the few companies that defy the odds seem to do so by overcoming the laws of economics and human nature that drive managers to repeat whatever worked for them in the past. These organisations have a knack for developing new technologies, business models and organisational skills – even when such innovations undermine the business on which their success was built.Take Toyota: the Japanese car giant first gained an edge over its US and European rivals by institutionalising lean production and attention to quality. As GM, Ford, Volkswagen and others began to ape its manufacturing practices, Toyota worked to develop its vehicle design and marketing skills. The results can be seen in the success of the upmarket Lexus and youth-oriented Scion brands. With its competitors again making headway, Toyota is moving the goalposts once more: its hybrid power technology, used first in the Prius family car but now being rolled-out across the range, looks poised to become a source of significant competitive advantage.The language coined by Prof Hamel and Prof Prahalad in Competing for the Future remains apt. Toyota has used “stretch goals” (although its long-held ambition to become the world’s largest carmaker is no longer such a stretch: it is likely to overtake GM within two years) and has had the “foresight” to “develop competences far in advance of products”. Exhibit A: its long-term investment in hybrid technology when conventional automotive wisdom was that vehicles with both internal combustion and electric motors could never be sold at a profit.What prevents other big companies from acting with such vision? Every market-leading company is bursting with ideas about how customers can be better served, products improved and working practices made more efficient. Where managers seem to fall short is in their ability to select the right ideas and turn them into successful businesses.Prof Christensen sees microeconomics at work: market leaders are reluctant to invest in low-tech, low-margin products aimed at new customers when better returns are available from high-tech refinements of products aimed at existing customers. Thus big companies often retreat upmarket, leaving upstart competitors with seemingly inferior products to attack them from below. Such is the dynamic of “disruptive innovation”.Mr Pascale, in contrast, found fault in conceptions of what management entails. “The ultimate and largely ignored task of management is one of creating and breaking paradigms,” he wrote. “The problem is that we devote 99 per cent of energy to squeezing more out of existing paradigms.”Prof Hamel elaborated on this idea. His prescription for finding new paradigms involves implementing processes, metrics and reward systems to harness the untapped creative potential of organisations. His manifesto, fully articulated in Leading the Revolution (2000), is to take the mystery out of innovation.Management gurus continue to offer variations on these themes. In Making Innovation Work, Tony Davila, Marc Epstein and Rob Shelton offer their own step-by-step process for turning ideas into new businesses within large companies. Next month sees the publication of Dealing with Darwin, in which Geoff Moore, a Silicon Valley-based consultant, venture capitalist and confidant of John Chambers, Cisco CEO, offers a taxonomy of 14 different types of innovation and a guide to redirecting resources towards “core” activities.Will these frameworks and theories act like organisational Viagra, helping middle-aged market leaders (Cisco included) to recapture the vigour of their youth? Or will we be treated to the unsavoury spectacle of bloated bureaucracies trying and failing to act like virile start-ups? The next two to three years will be a fascinating test of how much we really know about innovation, scale and strategy.
312;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-09T22:34:25Z;Wall St hopes of Santa Claus rally fade;;Wall Street’s year-end rally sputtered to a halt this week as rising energy prices and lingering concerns about further interest rate increases kept buyers on the sidelines.The three main indices fell for a second week in a row, having rallied for five weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent over the five sessions, dragged down by losses in chip maker Intel and troubled drugmaker Merck. The S&P 500 was off 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7 per cent.“The market is still in a consolidation phase after the big upswing we had in November,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., of the falls.“Historically, when the market has a good run in November, December tends to be flat. It will take a significant macro catalyst to take the market out of this sideways action.”Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, also blamed the purging of the overbought level in November. However, he expected the rally to resume towards the end of December.“That is the time of the year when portfolio managers dress up their portfolio,” he said. “They tend to buy the best-performing stocks so that they can show ownership at the end of the year. This in turn should push the market higher.”The week’s losses would have been heavier but for a small recovery on Friday.The Dow, helped by General Motor’s 4.2 per cent rebound, closed up 0.2 per cent, or 23.46 points, at 10,778.58.The S&P 500 edged 0.3 per cent, or 3.53 points, higher to 1,259.37, while the Nasdaq added 0.5 per cent, or 10.27 points, to 2,256.73.The market’s concern about monetary tightening was underlined by the record high gold prices.But another rising asset - energy - threatened to dash any lingering hopes of a Santa Claus rally.The Amex oil index rose by as much as 1.7 per cent this week after prices of natural gas, heating oil and crude oil all climbed in response to the season’s first winter storm, which swept across the US mid-west and north-east.Sliding inventories and tight supplies also helped drove up prices. Close to 30 per cent of the natural gas production facilities in the Gulf Coast remain closed as a result of Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and Wilma.The index finished the week almost unchanged after crude prices pulled back sharply yesterday.The short-lived rally was enough to boost the energy sector (up 0.7 per cent on the week), while energy-sensitive stocks, namely transport and airline shares, suffered, the former falling 1.3 per cent.Retailers also retreated, falling 0.6 per cent on fears that higher heating bills would drain money from Christmas shoppers’ pocketbooks. Department store operator Kohls fell 2.1 per cent to $46, while luxury jeweler Tiffany slid 2 per cent to $40.22.Elsewhere, chipmakers fell victim to the adage “buy on the rumour, sell on the news”, after a rosy mid-quarter update from Texas Instruments on Thursday prompted more sell-offs in the semiconductor sector.The pull back was largely expected. Chipmaking has rallied strongly in November on anticipation that seasonal demand for consumer electronics goods would drive up sales.Overall, the Amex semiconductor index shed 3.3 per cent over the week, with Texas closing 2.2 per cent lower at $33.37 and Micron Technology down 6.7 per cent at $13.41.Sector heavyweight Intel also took it to the chin. Its shares sold off 4.9 per cent to $26.08 on the week, after it narrowed its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to $10.4bn to $10.6bn.On the deal front, a surprise $25bn bid from Boston Scientific sent shares in troubled medical device maker Guidant 8.7 per cent higher for the week at $67.20.Boston Scientific and rival bidder Johnson & Johnson both slumped on the news. But St Jude Medical gained 6.3 per cent to $51.32 on the week following speculation that the company might become an acquisition target for the loser of the Guidant deal.Meanwhile, investors paused to take profit on recent winners. Google fell 2 per cent to $409.20 for the week.
313;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-08T21:38:17Z;Wall Street follows semiconductor sector lower;;Chipmakers fell victim to the old market adage “buy on the rumour, sell on the news” on Thursday after a rosy mid-quarter update from Texas Instruments prompted more sell-offs in the semiconductor sector.Texas, the second-largest US chipmaker behind Intel, fell 2.8 per cent to $32.63 after it increased the low end of its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue forecast.The fall in Texas shares was largely expected. The chipmaking sector has enjoyed a healthy rally in November on reports of strong demand for consumer electronics goods in the run up to the holiday shopping season.Overall, the Amex semiconductor index shed 1.7 per cent as the other chip stocks also lost ground to the consolidation.Intel pulled back 1.7 per cent to $25.70 ahead of its mid-quarter guidance report, due after the close, while Xilinx fell 1.7 per cent to $26.02 after it too improved its forecast for the current quarter.The losses weighed on the wider market, which closed decidedly lower after having hovered around its Wednesday closing level throughout much of the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 0.5 per cent, or 55.79 points, to 10,775.12, dragged down by General Motors’ precipitous 4.5 per cent decline.The broader S&P 500 also backtracked, easing back 0.1 per cent, or 1.53 points to 1,255.84, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3 per cent, or 5.56 points to 2,246.45.The Amex oil index gained 1.5 per cent after crude futures rebounded as cold weather in the US northeast bolstered demand for heating oil.Homebuilders, which have seen heavy speculative activity in recent weeks as investors gauge the likelihood of a bursting of the housing price bubble, found respite in a drop in bond yields.The Philadelphia Homebuilding index bounced back 0.8 per cent, after slumping 2.3 per cent in the previous session on concerns over interest rate rises.Toll Brothers rose 3.6 per cent to $35.55 after unveiling a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit on a 40 per cent rise in revenue. However gains were limited by the company’s cautious outlook for fiscal 2006.Still on the earnings front, Brinker, owner of the the Chili’s restaurant franchise, had to lower its profit forecasts for the second quarter and the full year after a steak promotion lured in fewer customers than expected.The news drove shares down 9.7 per cent to $36.71.Retailer Costco slumped 2.2 per cent to $48.29 after its first-quarter profits came in below market expectations.Blackberry maker Research in Motion gave up early gains to close 1.4 per cent lower at $60.75.Its shares initially rose following reports that the company was in talks with NPT to end their long-running patent dispute.

Analysts said the sales target was around €1bn, a 10 per cent increase on the Euro 2004 football competition.Investors cheered Remy Cointreau after the champagne and spirit maker reported sparkling interims with a 129 per cent increase in net profit to €42.9m. Remy’s Chinese markets are expanding strongly with 30 per cent growth in the first half. Citigroup said the shares were undervalued and disposals of some champagne brands could unlock €6 per share. Remy rose 6 per cent to €39.24.Nokia increased 1.7 per cent to €15.41 after Texas Instruments said demand growth from the mobile phone industry had been stronger than expected.Both Merrill Lynch and UBS reiterated “buy” recommendations and raised their price targets on Nokia (Merrill to €18.3 from €16.7 and UBS to €18 from €16).Merrill said the market was missing the importance of emerging markets for the company, which should ensure 21 per cent earnings growth over the next three years.AHBR rose 14.1 per cent higher to €52.50 after the US private equity group Lone Star agreed to buy the Germany property bank but market talk suggested a counter-bid was possible.Morphosys added 8.3 per cent to €38.55 after the German biotechnology company raised its full-year guidance for net profits from €2m to €3.5m, well above current market expectations. Morphosys has extended its collaboration agreement with Bayer, up 0.6 per cent to €34.29 after upbeat comments on its cancer drug Nexavar, which could generate €1bn in sales.Encouraging passenger figures for November helped SAS, the Scandanavian airline, climb 5.5 per cent to SKr100.50. Air France-KLM rose 3.6 per cent to €17.50 while Deutsche Lufthansa ended 2 per cent higher at €11.98.KarstadtQuelle climbed 12.9 per cent to €11.84 after the German retail group moved to reduce its debt problems. Thomas Middelhoff, Karstadt’s chief executive, said there was no need for a further capital increase and announced restructuring plans including the disposal of some real estate assets. Slough Estates of the UK has agreed a €163.2m sale and leaseback property deal with Karstadt.Credit Suisse fell 1.2 per cent to SFr67 after Morgan Stanley said the Swiss
bank offered an interesting restructuring opportunity, although it preferred the risk/reward of UBS, off 0.2 per cent at SFr126.30, and Deutsche Bank, up 0.1 per cent at €84.05.The north American unit of EADS, the majority owner of Airbus, said its sales should grow 10 per cent next year and could reach $1bn, depending on future contract wins and possible acquisitions. The Franco-German aerospace giant has enjoyed a strong run this year but the shares edged 0.1 per cent lower to €32.68 yesterday.Novartis has won approval for the drug Femara to be used for a wider range of British women with breast cancer but the Swiss pharmaceutical company’s shares eased 1.1 per cent to SFr67.80.Heineken rose 0.4 per cent to €26.26 after the Dutch brewer said one of its joint ventures was looking at Fujian Sedrin, a Chinese brewery that is for sale.Kuoni climbed 3.1 per cent to €512.00 following the sale of its loss-making US unit, Intrav, to First Choice Holidays for SFr82m."
315;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-08T08:44:27Z;Nikkei suffers largest loss in two months;;The Nikkei 225 saw its biggest absolute loss in two months on Thursday, finishing the day down 301.30 points at 15,183.36. The Topix fell 1.9 per cent to 1,568.73. The sharpest falls were in the securities sector after a brokerage faced large losses from accidentally placing a sell order.The Nikkei’s 1.9 per cent loss also reflected particularly heavy falls in some domestic sectors – although many export-focused companies were also down sharply.Investors blamed profit-taking, with companies such as banks and department stores dropping sharply as investors locked in their sharp recent rises. The banking sector declined 2.7 per cent. Mitsubishi UFJ, the world’s biggest bank by assets, was down 3.1 per cent to Y1,580,000.Among department store operators, Takashimaya plunged 6.9 per cent to Y1,867 after Deutsche downgraded it to “sell” from “hold”, citing the rapid rise in its share price. Rival chains suffered a similar fate, with Isetan down 8 per cent to Y2,480, Mitsukoshi down 4.5 per cent to Y655 and Daimaru down 3.5 per cent to Y1,660.Securities houses were depressed partly by news that an unnamed brokerage was set to suffer a large loss after accidentally placing an order to sell 600,000 shares in recruitment company J-Com – more than 41 times its outstanding shares – on Thursday. Mizuho Securities, brokerage unit of the Mizuho banking group, admitted to the error after the market close. Earlier, the three biggest securities houses fell sharply despite denying involvement. Nomura declined 3.7 per cent to Y2,085. Daiwa Securities, its biggest rival, lost 3.2 per cent to close at Y1,221. Nikko Cordial, the smallest of the big three, declined 3.3 per cent to Y1,755. The sector plunged 3.5 per cent as a whole.Real estate dropped 2.4 per cent. Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s biggest real estate company, was down 2.4 per cent to Y1,991. Mitsubishi Estate, its largest rival, also fell 2 per cent to Y1,871.Insurance companies, heavily exposed to the vagaries of the stock market, dropped 3.7 per cent. Millea, Japan’s biggest non-life insurer, was down 3.3 per cent to Y2,020,000. T&D, the life insurer, fell 4.4 per cent to Y7,750.Upstream oil companies also declined as crude prices dropped back below US$60 a barrel. Inpex fell 1.9 per cent to Y1,020,000.In such a bearish environment, even chip-related stocks failed to gain much from a positive earnings forecast from their US rival Texas Instruments. Advantest, the world’s largest maker of chip-testing equipment, was down 0.6 per cent to Y10,860. Disco, which makes equipment used in the chip-manufacturing process, was down 1.5 per cent to Y5,800.
316;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-12-07T23:50:22Z;TI issues more optimistic Q4 forecast;;Texas Instruments on Wednesday issued a more optimistic revenue and profit forecast for its fourth quarter, citing the strength of demand for its wireless semiconductors for mobile phones and its digital television chips.TI also said it was suffering from low inventory levels that meant it was struggling to meet demand from customers, but maintained other component providers faced similar problems.In a mid-quarter-update, the second-largest US chipmaker after Intel said revenues should be between $3.560bn and $3.705bn, compared to its prior forecast of $3.425bn to $3.715bn.TI expected earnings per share of 38 to 40 cents, compared to the 36 to 40 cents predicted at the end of the third quarter.Semiconductor revenues, which account for the bulk of sales, should be between $3.2bn and $3.325bn, compared to $3.075bn to $3.325bn. Sensors and controls could reach $295m to $305m, narrowing the prior range of $290m to $310m. The forecast for its Educational and Productivity Solutions division, best known for TI’s calculators, narrowed from $60m to $80m to $65m to $75m.“We are seeing strength in a range of areas, wireless is running ahead of expectations, as is DLP [television chips] and high-performance analog [chips],” Ron Slaymaker, investor relations head, told an analysts’ conference call.But the company’s inventories were lower than desirable and its operations were stretched, he added.“I can’t say we’re completely meeting customer demand, but you’ve got many other component companies in the same situation. It could be that if we did ship more, customers might not be able to use [the inventory] because they don’t have the other components they need.”Xilinx, which makes chips for digital cameras and high-definition televisions, also increased its forecasts yesterday for its current quarter, reporting stronger-than-expected demand in North America and Asia.Intel will issue its mid-quarter update later today [Thu], with analysts expecting it to raise its existing fourth-quarter guidance of $10.2bn to $10.8bn in revenues, helped by increased demand last month for both its notebook and desktop PC processors.The Semiconductor Industry Association said on Friday that strong demand for consumer electronics drove worldwide chip sales to $20bn in October, up 6.75 per cent on a year earlier.
317;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-11-16T23:40:03Z;Consumer products to drive chip sales;;Global sales of microchips will reach $309bn in 2008, up 45 per cent on the $213bn recorded in 2004, according to the annual forecast of the Semiconductor Industry Association trade body.The SIA predicted a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10 per cent for 2005 to 2008. It sees sales increasing nearly 7 per cent to $227bn this year, having earlier predicted flat growth when an inventory build-up signalled a possible slump. Sales growth should rise steadily – by 8 per cent in 2006 to $245bn, by 10.5 per cent to $271bn in 2007, and by 14 per cent in 2008, it said.“Consumer products will be the major growth-drivers in the years ahead,” said George Scalise, SIA president. He cited cell phones, portable media players and digital TVs as the major products boosting the chip sector.“Consumers are now driving most of the advances in personal computers, which have become the hub of home technology,” he added.“Fast-growing consumer markets are expanding demand for leading-edge products for digital signal processing, flash memory, and power management.”The SIA anticipates digital TVs and MP3 players both enjoying 52 per cent growth rates next year, compared with 9 per cent for digital cameras, 10 per cent for PCs and 13 per cent for cell phones.Digital Signal Processors, the major products of Texas Instruments, should enjoy the strongest growth among semiconductors at 17.2 per cent as more are used in phones and a broader range of consumer devices.D-Ram memory-chip sales are expected to fall 10 per cent due to a “mild cyclical decline”.In a separate report, the Gartner research firm yesterday forecast modest growth during the next few years with a mild slowdown in 2007 when growth would be only 5.1 per cent, less than half the figure predicted by the SIA.Gartner said there was something of a void in semiconductor demand to be filled as the PC and cell phone markets entered maturity and lost their ability to fuel strong growth.
318;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-11-03T22:04:25Z;Multi-chip tariff deal set to boost global trade;;The US has reached agreement with the European Union, Japan, Korea and Taiwan to eliminate tariffs on computer chips used in cell phones, digital cameras and Blackberry devices, a move that should accelerate trade in a $4bn global industry.The deal, announced in Washington on Thursday, will boost sales for large US makers of the so-called multi-chip integrated circuits, or MCPs, such as Intel, Micron and Texas Instruments.US companies account for more than half of global production of the circuits, and annually export about $1bn (€830m, £550m) in MCPs.It may also give a boost to the deadlocked Doha round of global trade negotiations in advance of a critical meeting of trade ministers in Hong Kong next month.“A key goal of the US in the [Doha] negotiations is to eliminate tariffs on manufactured products in all sectors,” said Rob Portman, the US trade representative. “This agreement will serve as a shot in the arm for these talks.”Most global trade in computer-related products has been duty-free since the completion of the 1996 Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a 66-country pact that removed tariffs on many knowledge-based and high-technology exports.But MCPs slipped through the net because they were not invented when the agreement was negotiated.The US currently levies a 2.6 per cent duty on imports of MCPs, while EU duties are at 4 per cent and Korean tariffs at 8 per cent.Under the agreement, those duties will all be eliminated from January 1. Japan does not charge a tariff on MCP imports.MCPs allow producers to place memory and processing chips in the same package, drastically improving the functionality and quality of communication devices. Already a $4.2bn industry, MCP production is expected to double by 2008.The US, the European Union, Japan, Korea and Taiwan currently account for about 70 per cent of global MCP production.The US hopes to turn yesterday’s agreement into a global pact under the World Trade Organisation, which can happen after countries accounting for 90 per cent of world production have signed the deal.Mr Portman leaves on Sunday for a series of meetings on Doha in Europe, Africa and Asia in an effort to craft a deal in the critical agriculture negotiations before the Hong Kong ­summit.“We have 40 days now before the Hong Kong ministerial [meeting] and I intend to do everything that we can as USTR and as the United States to maximise the possibility of having a successful Hong Kong meeting,” he said.
319;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-10-28T19:36:37Z;Qualcomm rivals take case to EU;;Nokia, Texas Instruments and other leading makers of mobile phones and the chips that power them have formally complained to Brussels that Qualcomm, the US mobile chipmaker, has unfairly used its patents on 3G technologies to squeeze excessive royalties and licensing deals out of the industry.US chipmakers Broadcom and Texas Instruments, and Ericsson, NEC, Nokia, Panasonic Mobile Communications have each filed complaints to the European Commission requesting it investigate Qualcomm and take action to stop its alleged anti-competitive conduct.Qualcomm holds patents on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology that have generated billions of dollars in royalties. It is seeing worldwide adoption of its own next-generation CDMA2000 technology and the WCDMA standard it played a large part in creating. It earns royalties from both.In a statement, the companies said Qualcomm had refused to license patents to chipset competitors on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms” while “offering lower royalty rates to handset customers who buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm”.They also said Qualcomm’s royalties on WCDMA were “excessive and disproportionate”, given that Qualcomm charged the same rate for CDMA 2000, despite less of its technology being used in WCDMA.“Major telecommunications equipment companies on three continents are standing up and saying that Qualcomm’s business practices are unfair, uncompetitive and ultimately illegal,” said David Dull, general counsel at Broadcom.Analysts said the unexpected coalition exposed the sector’s fears that Qualcomm could take the lion’s share of the spoils from the development of next-generation technologies.Maurits Dolmans, partner at Cleary Gottlieb, the law firm representing Nokia, said Qualcomm’s practices were keeping the costs of 3G technology prohibitively high, and were ultimately hurting consumers purchasing next-generation handsets.“The amounts are very significant – possibly in the billions of dollars,” he said.Broadcom has already made a separate complaint in the US legal system, but has gathered a wider coalition to take the issue to the European Commission, Europe’s leading antitrust authority.The company said on Friday: “Qualcomm cannot comment at this time.”The Commission invariably takes months to scrutinise the legal arguments and facts of a case after receiving a complaint.
320;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-10-25T20:39:48Z;Equities battle to make headway;;World equity markets had a more subdued session on Tuesday as the relief rally that accompanied Monday’s nomination of Ben Bernanke to replace Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve showed signs of fading.Weak US consumer confidence data and a disappointing outlook statement from Texas Instruments added to the uncertain mood on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 was off 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent weaker.European stocks also failed to make any headway. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 per cent.On Monday, the Dow and S&P recorded their biggest one-day point gains for six months as Wall Street applauded Mr Bernanke’s nomination to be the new Fed chief. “Bernanke represents, in many ways, continuity of the Greenspan tradition,” said Toby Nangle, director of fixed income at Baring Asset Management.“He fosters an attitude of benign neglect with respect to asset bubbles. He has demonstrated an asymmetric concern with downside risks to the US economy, has Republican sympathies and believes in Bush’s tax agenda.“The fact that Bernanke’s assessment of the economy differs significantly from that of the Fed suggests that the chances of a Fed policy error (over-tightening) decrease with Bernanke at the helm, and the chances of a policy error on the over-easing side will increase.”Meanwhile, Tuesday’s main US economic release showed an unexpected decline in consumer confidence to a two-year low.“We had suspected that the market was being a little too optimistic in looking for a rise today, particularly given the University of Michigan sentiment index had already told a similar story to this report,” said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets.“Nonetheless, with consumer energy bills likely to come down gradually and employment prospects remaining pretty good we believe that confidence is likely to recover in the coming months.”The US confidence figures contrasted sharply with the latest survey on German business sentiment from the Ifo economic institute.The Ifo’s headline index rose to a five-year high of 98.7 in October, from 96 in the previous month.Dirk Schumacher, economist at Goldman Sachs, pointed out that neither political developments, stock market declines nor high oil prices seem to have affected conditions or expectations in the least.“If maintained for the next couple of months, this kind of [Ifo] reading will convince the European Central Bank that the recovery may have moved finally into a higher gear,” he said.The Ifo report helped drive the euro back above $1.21 as the market took the view that a rise in eurozone interest rates was more likely.But European government bond prices fell back, with the yield on rate-sensitive two-year notes rising 6 basis points to 2.54 per cent.Treasury bond prices weakened slightly in spite of the poor US confidence data. The yield on 10-year paper were up 8 basis points to 4.528 per cent.Crude prices rallied in the wake of the sharp falls seen last week. December West Texas Intermediate traded on Nymex was up $2.12 a barrel at $62.44 at the close of New York trade.Gold rose sharply in Europe, helped by the weaker tone of the dollar against the euro and the rebound in crude oil prices.
321;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-10-25T20:30:42Z;Wall Street pauses for breath;;Wall Street bulls paused for breath on Tuesday after their broadest rally in more than a year as several downbeat earnings forecasts encouraged profit-taking.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at Charles Schwab’s CyberTrader unit, warned clients that Monday’s rally “does not guarantee” further gains, even though such broad rallies tend to herald more durable advances, rather than their conclusion.Shares in Texas Instruments fell 7.7 per cent to $28.55 after the maker of mobile phone chips gave a lower guidance than expected for earnings for the fourth quarter.Also in technology, Lexmark International was 6.5 per cent lower at $39.69 after the printer maker reported sharply declining third quarter profits.PortalPlayer, which makes chips used in Apple’s iPod music players, tumbled 27.7 per cent to $20.15 after the company announced a secondary share offering aimed at raising cash.Altera shares gave up 7.3 per cent to $16.43 a day after the maker of programmable chips said its third quarter revenues would fall short of earlier estimates.Similarly, Altiris saw its shares decline 4.3 per cent to $16.90 after the software company reported falling profits in its third quarter.There was some excitement away from technology stocks as Primedia shares plunged 35.1 per cent to $1.98, a day after the news that its chief executive had left while the niche publisher was exploring plans to split itself into two units.In the same sector, Cablevision Systems lost 12.8 per cent to $24.26 after news its owners, the Dolan family, gave up on taking the cable television operator private.Among Dow components, DuPont, the chemicals manufacturer, saw its stock gain 3 per cent to $40.80 as the announcement of a share buyback offset news of quarterly loss and a warning of profits below expectations in the fourth quarter. Dow Chemical, a rival, was 0.9 per cent lower at $43.89.Also on the old economy side of the market, Sherwin-Williams shares lost 9.1 per cent to $40.75 after the paint manufacturer warned of higher raw materials costs weighing on its latest and future earnings.Against the predominantly negative backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 7.13 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 10,377.87 at the close of the session. The broader S&P 500 index fell 2.84 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,196.54 and the Nasdaq Composite index retreated 6.38 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,109.45.Arthur Hogan, the chief US markets strategist at Jefferies & Co, said that Tuesday’s session amounted to “a whole lot of nothing. However, he said that the stage had been set for a 1,000-point move of the Dow industrials in either direction. “As such, we’ll take flat instead of 100-points down any day,” he said.Defence contractors also suffered, with Lockheed Martin off 1.8 per cent at $61.23 as analysts raises concern about its growth outlook, despite the company reporting 39 per cent growth in third quarter profits.Peer Northrop Grumman was 1.8 per cent off at $52.92 after it reported stalling profits, adding that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico had damaged its shipyards.
322;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Demand drives Texas Instruments to record;;Texas Instruments reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly revenues to a record $3.59bn as more of its chips were used in mobile phones and electronic devices.TI said third-quarter sales were up 11 per cent on the previous quarter and 10 per cent on a year earlier. Profits of $631m equated to earnings per share of 38 cents, which matched the previous quarter, but were hit for the first time by a 3 cent adjustment for the expensing of stock options, as well as 1 cent for higher taxes. Earnings per share were 32 cents a year ago.Wall Street had expected earnings of 40 cents on revenues of $3.5bn, according to Thomson First Call. TI’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $29.88 in after-hours trading.It predicted revenues in the fourth quarter of $3.425bn to $3.715bn with earnings per share of 36 to 40 cents after 3 cents of stock-option expensing were taken into account. Analysts were expecting earnings of 41 cents and sales of $3.63bn.The company said its growth was driven by semiconductors, up 13 per cent on the previous quarter and a year ago, “with particularly strong demand for digital signal processors and analogue chips used in a variety of communications and entertainment electronics”. TI said it had reached new highs for gross margin at 49.3 per cent and operating margin at 22.7 per cent.“TI continues to hold leadership positions in semiconductors for both the high and low ends of the cellphone market,” said Rich Templeton, chief executive.Revenue from 3G phones was on track to exceed $1bn this year while low-priced phones with TI chips were penetrating markets such as China, India, Brazil and Africa, he added.Inventory was at “less than desired levels”, down $44m on the previous quarter at $1.16bn on September 30.
323;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-10-12T20:41:26Z;Tech stocks suffer on Wall Street;;Disappointing quarterly earnings and downbeat analyst comments kept Wall Street technology stocks on the back foot on Wednesday.Apple Computer weighed on the sector a day after the maker of iPods reported below-forecast quarterly revenues, sending its shares 4.5 per cent lower to $49.25. PortalPlayer, which supplies the chips for iPods, was down 3.2 per cent to $26.13.The decline made the tech-laced Nasdaq Composite the worst performer of the three main US equity gauges and sent it to its lowest point in 3½ months.Downgrades compounded the technology sector’s woes. Prudential downgraded Intel, as well as the rest of the semiconductor sector. Shares in the world’s largest chipmaker headed 0.8 per cent lower to $23.24.Intel pulled its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in its wake. AMD’s above-forecast quarterly results were overshadowed by dented hopes of higher margins. The Prudential analyst who was downbeat about Intel was positive about AMD, but this still did not prevent AMD shares from falling 12.5 per cent to $20.99. AMD has still managed to outperform the Philadelphia Semiconductor index so far this year.The chip index eased 0.4 per cent, with more than half of its 19 components bucking the downward trend. Risers included Texas Instruments, up 2.2 per cent to $29.72, and KLA Tencor, up 1.5 per cent to $46.55.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent, or 35.70 points, to 10,217.47, while the broader S&P 500 index edged off 0.6 per cent, or 7.15 points, to 1,177.72. The Nasdaq Composite index was 1.2 per cent, or 23.62 points, lower at 2,037.47.Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the market was approaching oversold levels fast and estimated that “being bullish sometime in the middle of next week will be the right camp to be in”.The Dow received strong support from Pfizer, which gained 2.2 per cent to $24.84 after a British judge blocked an attempt by a rival company to copy Pfizer’s highly successful Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol drug.Elsewhere among drug stocks, Merck put on 0.2 per cent to $26.80 while GlaxoSmithKline’s US-listed shares added 1.2 per cent to $50.73. However, it was Schering-Plough’s 4.2 per cent advance to $20.67 that led the gains for the Amex Pharmaceutical Index, which climbed 0.4 per cent.The drumroll of earnings reports continued, and Harley-Davidson shares added 2.9 per cent to $46.94 after the maker of the iconic motorcycles reported a 16 per cent increase in quarterly profits.True Religion’s guidance to better-than-expected profits was not enough to halt a 13.4 per cent decline in the clothing maker’s stock to $13.81. Analysts at Wedbush Morgan downgraded it, citing valuation concerns.
324;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-10-04T20:35:29Z;Wall St sells off amid rising inflation fears;;Wall Street staged a late sell-off to close sharply lower on Tuesday after Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, heightened fears of rising inflationary pressures.Mr Fisher said inflation was “near the upper end of the Fed’s tolerance range” and the central bank needed to be “especially vigilant”, which raised the spectre of yet tighter monetary policy.As a result the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9 per cent lower at 10,441.11, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,214.47 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8 per cent to 2,139.36.The market had earlier been supported by lower oil prices. But Joe Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck, said stocks would stay under pressure until evidence emerged that the US economy had proved its resilience in the wake of damage from hurricanes Rita and Katrina. “The real challenge is stagflation: declining economic activity with heightened inflationary pressures,” he said.Lexmark International. the computer printer maker, slumped 28.6 per cent to $43.50 after warning third quarter earnings would be less than half its prior estimate owing to falling demand.Bleach to cat-litter maker Clorox also unveiled a profit warning, cutting its full-year forecast owing to rising energy costs. Despite saying it would raise prices to partially offset this, its shares fell 1.4 per cent to $53.81.Procter & Gamble, 2.1 per cent softer at $58.08, was hit by similar concerns with Citigroup Smith Barney downgrading the consumer products group on concerns over rising raw material costs.But airlines were a bright spot, thanks to lower oil prices and strong traffic data, with Continental Airlines rising 5.8 per cent to $10.48 and AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, up 4.4 per cent at $11.57.Mylan Laboratories rose 5.5 per cent to $20.44 as the Food and Drug Administration gave it the go-ahead to market a generic version of Norvasc, Pfizer’s blood pressure medication. Abbott Laboratories, 3.6 per cent better at $44.02, was aided by FDA approval for Humira, its arthritis drug.But Chesapeake Energy, the third-largest US natural gas producer, slipped 3.2 per cent to $38.61 after agreeing to buy Columbia Natural Resources for $2.2bn in cash from Triana Energy Holdings, a private equity groupEastman Kodak fell 3.9 per cent to a 22-month low of $23.16 as JPMorgan downgraded the photography company, warning profitability in its new digital markets remained weak. Chipmaker Texas Instruments fell 5.3 per cent to $32.08 on a downgrade, in the belief margins have reached their cyclical peak from Goldman Sachs.Sun Microsystems closed 0.6 per cent higher at $4.21 after Google announced it would distribute Sun’s Java technology, a rival to Microsoft’s Office system. Sun had risen to $4.56 in anticipation of a more lucrative tie-up. Google fell 2.4 per cent to $310.91. Microsoft lost 2 per cent at $24.98.
325;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Technophile: Hector de Jesus Ruiz;;What’s in your pocket? I always carry my RIM Blackberry. I’m on the road a lot and having instant access to my e-mail and my updated calendar no matter where I go is tremendously valuable.First crush? I worked at TI [Texas Instruments] when the company introduced the TI-3000 calculator, the word’s first single-chip calculator in the early 1970s. I was a part of the team in the labs that developed a method to test for defective parts.Because of the simplicity of the design, TI enjoyed a significant manufacturing and cost advantage over competitor’s multi-chip calculator design.A simple calculator that can only do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division doesn’t seem too awe-inspiring these days, but at the time, the TI-3000 was a major achievement in electronics and it was a great honour to have been a part of it.True love? The internet. Because it allows for real-time global communications and universal access to vast amounts of information, the internet is one of the most empowering technologies that ever created.There is nothing I have ever seen with the ability to have such a positive impact on daily life around the world. Now, we just need to make sure as much of the world’s population has access to the Internet as possible.Latest squeeze? I love my Acer 4000 Ferrari laptop. It looks great, and does everything I want to do with a computer, all in a lightweight package that I can easily tote around the world.It is the world’s first notebook to harness the same carbon fibre technology pioneered and perfected in the world of Formula One racing and the aerospace industry and features a powerful AMD Turion 64 processor. The performance and looks are everything you would expect from a Ferrari.What makes you mad? Technology that is bigger or faster but not better. A lot of companies in the technology industry have been guilty of pushing the limits of innovation because they can, with no connection to what users really want or need.I don’t need to listen to MP3s on my mobile phone but I do need a super-slim global phone with a battery that lasts a month that doesn’t drop calls.To me, innovation is only worthwhile if it is focused on solving real-world problems. Anything else is just innovation for innovation’s sake.What was your biggest tech disaster? I like to watch movies. At home, I wanted to build a super-high-tech, state-of-the-art home theatre system.With a PhD in electronics, I thought it would be fun and challenging to set it up myself. Was I ever wrong. I eventually had to pay someone to come out and set up my new system. It was so complex, I couldn’t get it to work properly for all of my efforts. Even now that the system is set up, the remote control is so complex that sometimes I struggle to do the simplest things, like play a movie.The whole experience was very frustrating, and reinforced a belief I’ve had for a long time. Technology is only as powerful as it is accessible and useable.If money were no object? Every Ferrari model ever produced.PC or Mac? A PC with AMD64 processors. Of course.Linux or Windows? On PCs, I use Windows.Google or not? I lean toward MSN, but also use Google and Yahoo. I find each service has its own strengths, and the fact that they are all competing to give users a better search experience results in constant improvements. It is the free market on internet time, and every user wins.Previous technophile columns
326;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-09-13T20:23:52Z;Retailers drag Wall Street into the red;;An unexpected decline in the US trade deficit and a smaller than expected rise in producer prices failed to buoy Wall Street on Tuesday as sagging retailers helped drag stocks into the red.Northwest Airlines plunged more than 50 per cent on bankruptcy fears.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 85.50 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 10,597.44. The S&P 500 lost 9.35 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,231.21, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 11.08 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,171.75.The slide followed a mixed performance on Monday as investors struggled to get to grips with a wave of mergers and acquisitions.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said a slow period for earnings news and technical trading patterns indicated that stocks would remain rangebound over the next four to six weeks.“Outside of crude oil and energy prices, there is little out there to act as a catalyst for the market,” he said. “It’s a market that is better for traders than investors.”The leading US indices failed to rally in early trading on Tuesday after economic data came in better than expected. A government report showed that producer prices rose 0.6 per cent last month, less than the expected 0.7 per cent.A separate report showed that the US trade deficit narrowed by 2.6 per cent in August to $57.9bn. Analysts said the unexpected pullback would likely be reversed by the recent spike in oil prices, which tends to increase the dollar value of US imports.Retailers were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after Best Buy, the electronics retailer, issued disappointing third-quarter guidance. Shares in Best Buy, which reported a 47 per cent rise in earnings in the second quarter, slipped 11 per cent to $44.79. Circuit City, a rival, lost 2.7 per cent to $16.46, while RadioShack fell 2 per cent to $25.68.Other retailers also fell on fears that high petrol prices could hit consumer spending in the second half. Wal-Mart, which last month warned about the impact of higher fuel prices, fell 1.8 per cent to $45.07, while rival Target fell 2.2 per cent to $54.19.Airlines suffered steep losses amid concerns that Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines were preparing to file for bankruptcy. Northwest plummeted 52.6 per cent to $1.57. Delta shares fell 8.2 per cent to 78 cents. Both carriers have been hit hard by soaring fuel costs.Semiconductors bucked the downward trend to notch the strongest performance on the S&P, with Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, rising 2.5 per cent.Ford Motor gave up early gains to slip 1 per cent to $9.82 as investors assessed the carmaker’s decision to sell its Hertz car rental unit to a consortium of private equity groups for $5.6bn.Knight Ridder, the newspaper group, fell 5.3 per cent to $61.46 after it said third-quarter profits would fall about 20 per cent.Home Depot, the building supplies retailer, was among the biggest drags on the Dow, with shares off 1.8 per cent at $40.60.
327;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
328;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-09-13T17:41:00Z;Nokia lifts its earnings forecasts;;"Nokia, the world’s largest mobile-phone maker, on Tuesday raised guidance for the third quarter on the back of higher-than-expected volumes and firmer pricing, sending the company’s shares up nearly 4 per cent.The Finnish group said a combination of “stronger than expected sales during the first two months of the quarter, good cost control and one-time positive items” had led it to alter its forecasts for the three months to the end of September.Investors reacted positively, sending the company’s shares up to close at €13.55. Analysts put the reaction down to relief in the market; in July the shares slumped 10 per cent after Nokia warned of a weak third quarter.The company’s more bullish stance on Tuesday came as no surprise to analysts, however. They pointed to an improvement in sales in recent months across the industry. Last week, Texas Instruments, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, upgraded its financial outlook for the quarter on the back of strong demand.“This is nothing dramatic following Texas Instruments’ upgrade last week,” said Per Lindberg at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. He also cautioned that the earnings upgrade was almost entirely attributable to extraordinary gains worth just over 1 cent from disposals that are expected to be completed this quarter, rather than any improvement in operating margins.“Nokia has spent a lot of money on marketing, which is leading to higher revenues and higher costs which are linked to muted income changes,” he added.Nokia said it was increasing earnings per share guidance from a range of €0.14-€0.17 to a range of €0.18-€0.19. Revenue guidance is up from a spread of €7.9bn to €8.2bn ($9.7bn-$10.05bn) to €8.4bn to 8.5bn.The group said that geographical sales mix and a firmer pricing also meant the decline in the average sales price was lower than anticipated."
329;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-09-08T21:59:56Z;Intel and TI upbeat on sales growth;;Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor company, said on Thursday it was on course to hit third-quarter sales forecasts, while its nearest US rival, Texas Instruments, felt confident enough to raise its profit forecast significantly.TI also announced a challenger to Intel’s Viiv brand, launched last month to target the digital home. TI said its new DaVinci platform was the most advanced semiconductor technology in the world for next-generation digital video.In its mid-quarter update, Intel said it expected revenues to October 1 to be between $9.8bn and $10bn - narrowing the previous range of $9.6bn to $10.2bn.“The company continues to see double-digit year-over-year growth driven primarily by strong demand for notebook PC platforms,” it said.Gross margins were expected to be 60 per cent, plus or minus a point, while its tax rate should be around 30.5 per cent, it said. The Silicon Valley company warned the tax rate would probably be hit by additional taxes of about $250m due to a potential repatriation of about $6.3bn of accumulated income earned abroad.Texas Instruments raised its expected earnings per share to September 30 from the 31 cents to 35 cents range, to 36 cents to 38 cents. Sales were expected to be between $3.48bn and $3.62bn, compared with $3.29bn to $3.56bn previously. Revenue forecasts for semiconductors, the bulk of its business, were raised from $2.835bn-$3.065bn to $3.02bn-$3.14bn.“We are seeing good solid growth across the product lines,” said Ron Slaymaker, investor relations vice-president. The expected increase in earnings per share was due to improved gross margins, operating expenses being under control, higher levels of factory utilisation and an improved product mix, he said.Intel shares were down 1.3 per cent at $25.76 in after-hours trading, while TI’s were up 1 per cent at $34.09.Rich Templeton, TI chief executive, told a news conference its DaVinci platform would dramatically reduce the complexity manufacturers faced in producing video equipment.DaVinci is expected to compact six to eight chips into one with TI’s fastest digital signal processor (DSP) at its core. It will also provide software support to handle the difficult transcoding of video in different formats between devices. Synchronising this at present was “as pointless as trying to listen to a CD on your old record player”, he said, predicting DaVinci would double already dramatic growth in devices such as TV set-top boxes, digital cameras and portable media players.Intel’s Viiv brand will be introduced in homes on PC-like devices running Windows Media Center software. Mr Templeton said TI would work more with consumer electronics manufacturers.“We’ve moved from an era where the PC has driven technology to an era where technology is being driven by entertainment,” he said.
330;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-08-22T20:20:55Z;Oil price climb curbs Wall Street gains;;Merger and acquisition activity gave an early fillip to US stocks on Monday but the main indices had a choppy day, as oil prices extended Friday’s gains, and markets stayed in relatively neutral territory.By close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 10,570.53. The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,221.79, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,141.44.Mergers and acquisitions announcements served to give the market an early stimulus.OSI Pharmaceuticals agreed to buy Eyetech Pharmaceuticals for about $935m, helping Eyetech shares surge 29.6 per cent to $18.13. OSI fell 21.7 per cent to $31.92.Canadian oil producer PetroKazakhstan surged 18.4 per cent to $53.75 after the company agreed to be bought by China National Petroleum Corporation for $55 per share.Meanwhile, television and radio broadcaster Emmis Communications said the company would sell nine of its 16 television stations for $681m to various television broadcasters. Shares in Emmis were up 9.2 per cent to $23.58, and they have gained more than 50 per cent since May.Department store Nordstrom said the company would buy a stake in Jeffrey, a company that owns high-end boutiques in New York and Atlanta. Shares were down 1.1 per cent to $33.18Later in the session the Maytag acquisition saga ended when the company signed a formal agreement to be acquired by Whirlpool. Maytag was down 0.1 per cent to $18.69 while Whirlpool shares were down 0.4 per cent to $81.48Merck shares continued falling after a ruling in Texas late on Friday required Merck to pay more than $250m to the family of a person who died after using its painkiller, Vioxx.Investors fear that the company might face thousands of lawsuits in regard to the drug. Merck said it would appeal against the decision. Shares were down 0.6 per cent to $27.89. The two-day loss for the company is almost 8.3 per cent.Technology issues also gained, defying some analysts’ forecasts that growth stocks would take a fall in the coming months.Motorola gained 2.3 per cent to $20.91 after the company said that it would book a $780m gain regarding completion of Sprint’s acquisition of Nextel. Microsoft shares also increased 0.7 per cent to $26.91.Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments rose 2.5 per cent to $31.95, while Intel shares lifted 1.6 per cent to $26.06. The semiconductor and semi-equipment sector enjoyed the biggest advance for the day on all S&P indices, up 1.5 per cent.Northwest Airlines shares climbed after the airlines had few important interruptions during the weekend after the threat of a workers’ strike. Flights ran smoothly despite the company’s mechanics going on strike. Shares were up 5.2 per cent to $5.66.
331;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-07-26T21:20:25Z;Positive earnings fail to inspire Wall Street;;Another batch of positive earnings failed to inspire Wall Street on Tuesday, as several companies, including bellwether Texas Instruments, reported better-than-expected earnings.Analysts said the market was largely waiting for key US economic data that will be reported later in the week, as many investors have already priced expectations for positive earnings into the markets.At the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 was at 1,231.16, up 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent at 2,175.99, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent at 10,579.77.“The market has already discounted the fact that the earnings are better than expected in general, so the earnings play isn’t going to be a major focus,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach. “What will be the focus are the upcoming economic numbers later in the week.”But that did not stop some US blue-chips advancing strongly on the back of positive earnings reports.Texas Instruments shot up more than 5.6 per cent after it reported second quarter profits that beat expectations. The Dallas-based chipmaker said earnings rose in the quarter to 32 cents a share, not including a one-off tax gain. Analysts had forecast 29 cents a share.The company also announced it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent to 3 cents and said it would buy back an additional $2bn in stock.Advanced technology and phone service provider Avaya rose after reporting that earnings per share had more than tripled to 40 cents per share from 13 cents for the same quarter last year. The company was up 16.4 per cent to $10.74.McGraw Hill also jumped 4.7 per cent to $46.53, as the company said second quarter earnings leapt 18 per cent to 51 cents.The rise in results came on the back of the lucrative financial services segment, which accounted for more than 80 per cent of operating profits.A number of Dow components reported on Tuesday, including DuPont, the country’s second-biggest chemicals company. It announced that net income in the second quarter more than doubled from the same period a year earlier. However, its shares were down 6.6 per cent to $41.15.Elsewhere, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, owner of the largest US futures exchange, said record derivatives trading volume helped second quarter net income rise to $2.36 a share, from $1.66 a year ago. Analysts, however, had expected earnings of $2.38 a share. The stock dropped sharply early in the day but recovered to be up 2.2 per cent at $303.50 at market close.Lexmark, the second biggest printer maker in the US, reported a 42 per cent fall in second quarter profit as it cut prices aggressively to compete with market leader Hewlett-Packard.Sales of original inkjet and toner cartridges also fell as customers sought cheaper generic products.ImClone Systems, the biotechnology group, reported second-quarter net profit of 30 cents a share, up from 29 cents a year ago, as sales of its Erbitux colon cancer treatment rose rapidly. However, excluding costs associated with the closure of its molecule research unit, underlying earnings rose to 37 cents a share, compared with 33 cents expected by analysts. Shares however were down 2.8 per cent to $34.09.
332;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-07-25T22:45:43Z;TI tops up dividend on strong sales;;Texas Instruments underlined the bullish mood among chipmakers by promising a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend together with continuation of its stock buyback programme.The second-largest US semiconductor company will pay a quarterly dividend of 3 cents a share from October, up from 2.5 cents.The board also authorised a new $2bn share buyback programme following a quarter in which TI invested $1.3bn in its own stock.Announcing second quarter earnings in line with Wall Street expectations, Rich Templeton, chief executive, said TI was benefiting from strong demand from manufacturers of consumer electronics.The company specialises in digital signal processing and analogue chips used in mobile telephones, music players and other electronic gadgets.The figures followed good financial results last week from chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom.Intel on Monday announced that it had selected Arizona as the site for a new chipmaking plant expected to cost about $3bn and create 1,000 new jobs.However, TI, despite the strong outlook, kept its capital expenditure forecast for this year unchanged at $1.3bn.Intel last week increased its capex forecast by $300m to $5.9bn.In the three months to June, TI achieved revenues of $3.2bn, unchanged from last year. Sales gains in some sectors were partially offset by disposals.Net income was $628m,or 38 cents a share, upfrom $441m or 25 cents a share.Earnings were boosted by a one-off tax benefit equivalent to 6 cents a share.Mr Templeton said growth in new orders left TI well placed to deliver “solid growth” in the current quarter. Semiconductor orders were $2.9bn, 7 per cent higher than a year ago.The company forecast earnings of 31-35 cents in the three months to September on revenues of $3.3-$3.56bn. Analysts were forecasting earning of about 32 cents.Optimism was underpinned by an improved performance from TI's Digital Light Processing (DLP) business, which makes chips based on proprietary technology that power big-screen televisions.Slower than expected growth of sales of DLP-based TVs in the fourth quarter of 2004 caused TI to slow production of DLP chips to prevent a build-up of inventory. Mr Templeton said the process of reducing inventories was now complete.TI stock gained 1.16 cents to $31.76 following the announcement, which came after the close in New York. The shares started this year at about $25.
333;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-07-13T08:19:48Z;Alan Cane: Brilliance is a matter of timing;;Here is how the UK failed to lead the world in microchip development. In 1952 Geoffrey Dummer, an engineer working at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern in England delivered a speech at a conference in Washington in which he described “electronic equipment in a block with no connecting wires. The block may consist of layers of insulating, conducting, rectifying and amplifying materials, the electrical functions being connected directly by cutting out sections of the various layers”.He was describing an integrated circuit, a slice of silicon on which transistors, resistors and capacitors are inscribed with a combination of photographic and chemical procedures. He was ahead of his time. The government failed to recognise the significance of his concept or fund its development and it was left to the Americans.Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments, who died last month, and the late Robert Noyce of Intel jointly claim the credit - and deservedly so - for the single most important contribution to the IT revolution, the development which made the miniaturisation of electronic devices possible.Neither Kilby, nor Noyce, who submitted their patent applications in July 1958 and January 1959 respectively were aware of Dummer’s ideas. Kilby said later: “Dummer’s thinking was valid and I think that, had we known about it, it might have accelerated the timing of things.”Dummer, Kilby and Noyce were engineers and the integrated circuit was an engineering solution to problems of size, cost, reliability and performance in electronic equipment. The science, the creation of the transistor and the explanation of its mechanics, had been carried out more than a decade before by Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain.It takes nothing away from the pioneering brilliance of Dummer, Kilby and Noyce to say that it would have been only a matter of time before a bright engineer hit on the idea of integrating transistors and other components on a semiconductor material. After all, Paul Eisler, the Austrian refugee who invented the printed circuit board had established the general principles some years earlier.He eliminated the tangles of wiring by printing patterns on copper-covered boards using an acid-resistant ink. Immersion in acid dissolved the unwanted copper leaving a pattern of electrical connections. He noted in his autobiography: “I am sure the basic concept of producing whole multi-layer circuits by integrating passive components with the conducting network…must have contributed in the mind of the American scientists to the creation of integrated circuits on a chip”.Kilby and Noyce’s first microchips integrated a few components and were more expensive than the discrete circuits they replaced. Today, Intel’s Itanium 2 microprocessor integrates some 410m transistors at a cost per transistor of some fraction of a cent. The integrated circuit made possible small, cheap circuits that rarely failed. Their performance was limited by the speed at which electrons moved in the wires connecting the chips together rather than the speed of the central processor.The number of transistors which can be inscribed on a chip has increased regularly over the past 40 years. This phenomenon is known as Moore’s Law, following an empirical observation by Gordon Moore of Intel that the number of components on a chip and computational capacity seemed to double every 18 months to two years at constant price. Moore’s Law continues to hold true today - more or less - and it is the key to the savage economics of the semiconductor industry. If a manufacturer is two months late with a chip which took three years to design, it is likely the product will be obsolete before it appears in the catalogue.But how long will Moore’s Law continue to hold sway? There are already problems with heat and power consumption which are stopping attempts to create ever denser chips in favour of what are called “multi-core processors” where computing operations are carried out by more than one processor on the same chip.Moore’s Law must fall foul of the laws of physics. In a recent interview, Moore speculated it might have only another 10 or 20 more years before it came up against the limits of molecular size. Some think him optimistic, others, like Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University and Glenn Starkman of CERN in Switzerland, too unambitious. In a recent paper, Krauss and Starkmann suggest: “Moore’s Law cannot continue unabated for more than 600 years for any technological civilisation.”If it does, it promises some staggering developments in a few years, an acceleration towards the “technological singularity” an expression used by the inventor Ray Kurzweil to indicate a rate of technological change so rapid that it will rupture the fabric of human history. It is a giant leap from that first simple circuit. Kilby used to tell the story of a rabbit and a beaver by the Hoover Dam. “Did you build that?” the rabbit asked. “No, but it was based on an idea of mine,” the beaver replied.
334;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-07-06T18:29:38Z;Oil price holds Wall Street back;;Upbeat economic news failed to stir Wall Street on Wednesday as stocks were undermined by the continued strength of oil prices.While figures from the Institute of Supply Management showed that growth in the US services industry accelerated more than forecast, obstinately high oil prices restrained the market.The ISM’s index for non-manufacturing companies was at 62.2 for June, compared with 58.5 in May.By mid-afternoon in New York the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 1,201.68, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.4 per cent to 10,331.75 and the Nasdaq Composite was slightly up at 2,081.83.Edward Hemmelgarn, chief investment officer of Shaker Investments, said the market was being pushed around by different “cross currents”.“The first is oil at $60, the second is that the better economic news makes people think that the Fed will keep raising rates. The third is that this is a very reasonably priced market, which is why there is so much takeover activity.”Zions Bancorp was the day’s biggest loser on the S&P 500 after the bank dropped 5.6 per cent to $69.25. The company has agreed to buy Amegy Bancorp for $1.7bn to extend its branch network in Texas. Amegy’s shares were down 3.9 per cent to $22.08.ADE saw its shares tumble by 20.2 per cent to $23.17 after the semiconductor equipment supplier cut its outlook for the first quarter on Tuesday.Texas Instruments the world’s largest maker of chips for mobile phones, was boosted after JPMorgan raised its earnings view on the company. Its shares climbed 1.6 per cent to $29.40.Another riser was Serologicals, the biological products company, that benefited from Banc of America’s decision to raise its rating to “buy” from “neutral”. The shares initially gained more than 5 per cent but were just 1.9 per cent higher at $21.11 by mid-afternoon.The pronouncements of Bryan Elliot, an analyst at Raymond James, knocked some of the wind out of the sails of companies that run restaurant chains.Mr Elliot warned that mid-market restaurants would be hit by rising fuel costs eroding consumer spending power. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers fell 4.3 per cent to $59.50 while Darden Restaurants, which operates Red Lobster Restaurants, lost 2.9 per cent to $31.87.Some of the gains made last week by Bausch & Lomb were reversed as the eyecare company fell 3.2 per cent to $84.74. The company had made sharp gains on the news that it will acquire a 55 per cent stake from Sino Biopharmaceutical.General Motors shares slipped 1.1 per cent to $34.40 despite news that a federal court had ruled in favour of GM in its bid to recover as much as $253m from the federal government for one of its underfunded pension plans.
335;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-07-05T18:46:08Z;Broadcom attacks rival over 3G mobile prices;;Broadcom has opened a new front in its legal battle with Qualcomm, alleging that its rival in the communications chip business is unfairly driving up the cost of third-generation mobile phones.In a complaint filed in the district court of New Jersey, Broadcom said Qualcomm was breaking federal antitrust law by failing to license its 3G technology “on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms”.Qualcomm said it was looking into the complaint but believed it was “without merit”.The suit revolves around the use of code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology, developed largely by Qualcomm and used as the basis for mobile phone services offered by a number of US network operators. A wideband version of the technology, W-CDMA, is incorporated in the international UMTS standard for 3G services.When the UMTS standard was drawn up in the 1990s, Qualcomm agreed to license W-CDMA on fair and reasonable terms. Broadcom alleges that it has breached this undertaking by offering favourable terms to companies that buy its chips instead of simply licensing the technology.“Qualcomm's monopoly in CDMA technology has increased the price of cell phones in the US and we are hoping that the courts will prevent the same thing from happening with the next generation of 3G cell phones,” said Scott McGregor, Broadcom chiefexecutive.In a separate suit filed in May, Broadcom charged Qualcomm with several violations of its patent portfolio.Qualcomm has been aggressive in defence of its intellectual property, suing a number of companies over their use of CDMA.Last month, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected Qualcomm's claim that Texas Instruments had violated the terms of a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies.
336;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-21T22:36:48Z;Jack Kilby, integrated circuit inventor;;Jack Kilby, the inventor of the integrated circuit that lies behind a trillion-dollar electronics market, has died at the age of 81.Texas Instruments, his employer at the time of his invention in 1958, said the Nobel Prize winner died in Dallas on Monday after a brief battle with cancer.Robert Noyce, co-founder of chipmaker Intel, made a similar silicon-based invention shortly after Mr Kilby and the two are now considered co-inventors of ICs.Mr Kilby is also credited as co-inventor of the handheld calculator and the thermal printer, but he will be best remembered for cracking the problem created by the invention of the transistor in 1947.Transistors replaced bulky and unreliable vacuum tubes but, as engineers hand-soldered more complex circuits using them, the circuit boards became more costly and prone to failure.Soon after joining TI in 1958, the electrical engineer came to the conclusion that “semiconductors were all that were really required that resistors and capacitors, in particular, could be made from the same material as the active devices [transistors],” he later wrote.“I also realised that, since all of the components could be made of a single material, they could also be made in situ interconnected to form a complete [integrated] circuit.”He demonstrated this to TI management with a transistor and other components on a slice of germanium, but it was several years before the invention gained credibility with defence industry orders and with the commercial success of TI's handheld electronic calculator.Without ICs, man would never have landed on the moon and computers would not have progressed beyond mainframes to today's desktop and mobile versions. Tom Engibous, TI chairman, said on Tuesday: “In my opinion, there are only a handful of people whose works have truly transformed the world and the way we live in it Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers and Jack Kilby.“If there was ever a seminal invention that transformed not only our industry but our world, it was Jack's invention of the first integrated circuit.”His achievement was recognised with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2000. IC sales totalled $179bn in 2004, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, and supported sales of electronic devices worth $1,186bn in 2003.
337;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Mobile phone chip dispute deepens;;A patent dispute between two leading cellphone chipmakers intensified on Monday with the US International Trade Commission launching an investigation.Broadcom said in a statement that the ITC would look into whether its rival Qualcomm had engaged in unfair trade practices by importing baseband processor and other cellphone chips that infringed Broadcom patents.Qualcomm makes many of its products in Taiwan before importing them to the US. Broadcom is seeking a permanent ban on the importation of such products.Broadcom had filed two complaints with the ITC a month ago. At the same time, it filed similar suits in a federal court in California, where the two companies are headquartered.The court action cited the infringement of 10 Broadcom patents and sought unspecified damages. Qualcomm has yet to respond publicly to its rival's allegations.Analysts have characterised Broadcom's actions as an attempt to raise its profile in a market dominated by Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. The company says it held months of fruitless discussions with Qualcomm over royalty payments for its patents.The dispute centres on chipsets for high-end phones using the latest technologies including 3G, Bluetooth, WiFi, voice over IP and multimedia processing. Broadcom is also focusing its action on the baseband processor, one of the highest value chips in a mobile phone.The company said its ITC case had been referred to a judge who would schedule a hearing and make an initial determination, expected to be issued early next year. A final decision should follow in the second half of 2006.
338;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-10T16:54:38Z;Bid rumours help Eurofirst to 3-year high;;A combination of bid speculation, strength in the oil sector and resurgent tech stocks helped drive European indices to fresh three-year highs this week.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed at 1,130.34, up 0.6 per cent on the day and 1.1 per cent on the week. The Paris and Frankfurt markets also finished at three-year peaks.Mediobanca was easily the best-performing European blue-chip amid persistent rumours that Stefano Ricucci, the property developer, was building a stake in the Italian investment bank. On Wednesday, Mr Ricucci denied he was buying shares.More than 5 per cent of Mediobanca’s capital changed hands on Thursday, and about 0.6 per cent of the company’s stock was traded in a single block on Friday.The shares ended the week at €15.75, up 10.7 per cent on the week and just off a seven-year high.Insurer Generali, which is 13.6 per cent owned by Mediobanca, was caught in the bid speculation, as was its unit Alleanza. Generali shares rose 4.5 per cent over the week to €26.10 while Alleanza added 3.5 per cent to €9.12. Financial services group Mediolanum rose 4.5 per cent to €5.42.Meanwhile, Dutch publishing group Wolters Kluwersaw its shares rise to their best level for nearly four months on talk that it could be a takeover target for Canadian rival Thomson. Wolters shares rose 5 per cent to €14.91.Semiconductor stocks continued to recover from the sharp losses incurred in the first quarter.The sector was boosted by a brace of positive outlook statements from US chip giants Intel and Texas Instruments, and further help came from news that the Semiconductor Industry Association had raised its forecast for 2005 sales.STMicroelectronics ended the week with a gain of 2.6 per cent at €13.13 and Infineon rose 2.5 per cent to €7.71.However, Stephen Pope of Cantor Fitzgerald Europe warned that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index in the US was approaching a key resistance level, which could hamper further progress for European chipmakers.Siemens, the electronics group, rose 3.2 per cent to €62.43 after it announced the sale of its loss-making mobile phones unit to BenQ of Taiwan.Deutsche Bank on Friday downgraded Siemens from “buy” to “hold”, although it raised its target price from €65 to €67.Heavily weighted energy stocks were among the week’s best performers in spite of modest losses for crude prices. Total gained 2.8 per cent to €187.70, Royal Dutchadded 1.6 per cent to €49.12 and Eni firmed 1.8 per cent to €21.56.Austrian oil and gas group OMV raced up 8.3 per cent to €315 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock and raised its price target.Richemont firmed 2.2 per cent to SFr41.95 after strong results from the Swiss luxury goods group prompted several brokers to raise their price targets for the stock.But French food retailers were weak on concerns that reforms designed to hand power back to consumers could be fast-tracked by Dominique de Villepin, prime minister.
339;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-09T21:53:19Z;Intel raises prediction for sales in Q2;;Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, on Thursday raised its second-quarter revenue expectations as it reported continuing strong demand for its notebook computer chips.In a mid-quarter update after the New York market closed, Intel said its expected sales range of $8.6bn to $9.2bn had been lifted to $9.1bn to $9.3bn. Gross margins should also improve in the quarter to July 2, from about56 per cent to 57 per cent, it said.Analysts have predicted that Intel's growth will be driven by the strength of its Centrino chip platform for notebook PCs. Current Analysis, a research firm, reported this week that US notebook retail sales in May exceeded those of desktop computers for the first time in a calendar month. Intel said gains from equity investments and interest would be higher than previously thought at around $100m, from $70m. An increase in research and development credits would reduce Intel's tax rate to about 26 per cent, compared to the previous expectation of 31 per cent.The company said all other expectations were unchanged.In a good week for Intel and the chip industry, Apple revealed on Monday that it was switching to Intel processors for its range of notebook and desktop computers.Texas Instruments, the number-two US chipmaker, said on Tuesday that it was seeing improved demand as it raised forecasts for second-quarter profits and salesThe Semiconductor Industry Association's 2005 forecast returned to growth on Wednesday as it revised estimates from flat sales to a 6 per cent increase for the year. It cited demand for mobile phones, computers, digital televisions and cameras as the key driver.Intel shares, which have enjoyed a run-up from $22 in mid-April, were down 1.2 per cent in after-hours trading at $27.36.RBC Capital Markets analysts upgraded their price target to $29 on Thursday as they raised their revenue forecast for the third quarter to $10.1bn and earnings per share from 33 cents to 36 cents. Intel would continue to outperform the semiconductor sector over the next few months as its margins tracked higher, they said in a note.“A big driver for Intel's strength over the past few quarters seems to be notebooks and government spending from devleoping countries that are trying to grab their share ofthe global PC renaissance,” RBC said.
340;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-09T20:29:57Z;Greenspan makes little impression on Wall St;;The latest assessment of economic growth and inflation prospects from Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, led to moderate gains on Wall Street on Thursday, led by technology shares.The broader market advanced in moderate trading volumes. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 10,503.02, while the S&P rose 0.5 per cent to 1,200.93 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8 per cent to 2,076.91.The labour department reported before opening that initial jobless claims last week fell by 21,000 to 330,000, near economists’ expectations. Much of the attention remained on Mr Greenspan, however.The Fed chairman said the US economy was on a “reasonably firm footing”, and indicated that the central bank would continue to fight inflation by raising interest rates at at “measured” pace.Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry handheld devices, fell 5 per cent to $73.55 after having hit a wall in its attempt to settle a patent dispute.Merrill Lynch analysts raised their 2006 revenue forecast on Google, saying it expected the company to continue benefiting from growth in the paid search format. Google shares were up 2.4 per cent to $286.31.Elsewhere in technology shares, Intel was up 2.2 per cent to $27.70 ahead of the mid-quarter update from the world’s largest semiconductor company, due after the close. The market looks to Intel’s news to shed light on the outlook for demand for technology and the end products powered by its chips. Intel said it expected sales to reach the higher end of its estimated range.Shares in H&R Block reached a 15-month high in morning trade after the tax and financial consulting company said it would split its stock, increase dividend and forecast results above analysts’ estimates. By the close, H&R Block was up 10.9 per cent to $56.18.In bid news, the shares of Niku rose 25.2 per cent to $20.66 in one of the leading performances among Nasdaq stocks, after Computer Associates said it would take over the software company for $350m in cash. CA was virtually unchanged at $27.01.On a less upbeat note Delphi, the auto parts group, saw its shares lose 4.9 per cent to $4.46 after announcing its treasurer’s resignation. It was one of the worst showings on the New York Stock Exchange, as Visteon, a competitor, fell 1.3 per cent to $6.72.Among telecommunications stocks, Qualcomm eased 1.1 per cent to $36.54 after a court ruled Texas Instruments, a rival, did not break licensing agreements with the company. TI shares inched up 0.5 per cent to $28.03.Shares in American International Group, the biggest US insurer by capitalisation, rose 1.1 per cent to $55.55 after Maurice Greenberg resigned as chairman. Mr Greenberg earlier this year stepped aside as chief executive of the insurer.
341;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-08T21:12:36Z;Overview: Low bond yields continue to baffle;;"World markets trod cautiously ahead of critical testimony by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to US Congress on Thursday.With few obvious macro news leads to digest, investors continued to be pre-occupied with trying to explain the conundrum of low global bond yields.US Treasury bond prices eased as yields edged higher. But yields on German, Swiss and Swedish bonds fell to record lows as further evidence of a weak European economy spurred investors into fixed-income assets.The benchmark 10-year bund yield touched a low of 3.12 per cent in early trading with traders increasingly betting that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates.By late trade in New York, the US 10-year note yielded 3.943 per cent, up 3.6 basis points, as investors took a wary stance ahead of the congressional testimony by Mr Greenspan. After the Fed chairman, in a Monday night speech via satellite to a Beijing conference, forecast long-term yields were likely to remain low, there was apprehension among investors that his congressional commentary might be
less positive for bonds.“It is very much a waiting game ahead of the testimony to Congress. The general expectation is that Greenspan will confirm what other Fed officials have been saying recently – that we are getting close to the top of the interest rate cycle,” said John Hatherly, head of global investment analysis at M&G Investments.“That is what the markets are banking on. As such, anything less than that will come as a disappointment.”Other analysts are saying the investment case for buying into bonds at current low yields is becoming increasingly stretched.“We are getting very close to the capitulation point with the bond bears throwing in the towel and trying to explain why bonds are good value at these levels,” said Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management. “We even saw signs of capitulation with Greenspan when he said that he did not understand why bond yields were so low but they were likely to remain so for a while.”Mr Talbut said the bond market was starting to move into territory where investors were “pricing in an almost perfect outcome for bonds and that there will be plenty of mug buyers” to sustain low yields. “Unless we are seeing a complete change in the way markets price bonds, we are getting close to the point where the brave call is to move out of bonds and into equities.”Equity markets were mixed. Wall Street had an early lift from an upbeat earnings forecast from Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, but gains were trimmed after the release of data showing showed a fall in oil inventories in the US.The US Department of Energy reported that crude supplies had fallen by 3m barrels to 330.8 mln for the week ending June 2, against forecast of a rise of 300,000 barrels.The data initially pushed prices for West Texas Intermediate for July delivery up, but the rally fizzled and the contract settled down $1.22 to $52.54 a barrel. Brent crude fell $1.02 at $52.11.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 10,476.86, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,194.67 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 6.98 points to 2,060.18.In Europe, markets were weaker despite a boost to semiconductor stocks from the Texas Instruments forecast. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.29 per cent, or 3.29 points, to 1,123.60.In Asia, Chinese shares saw their biggest one-day jump in three years on government moves to boost the market. The Shanghai composite index rose 8.2 per cent to 1,115.6 points. In Tokyo, the tech-heavy Nikkei 225 rose by 0.6 per cent to 11,281.03."

The S&P 500 fell 2.59 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,194.67, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 6.98 points to 2,060.18.A sputtering late-afternoon performance erased early gains and mirrored the stock market’s disappointing showing on Tuesday, when the Dow firmed but the S&P and Nasdaq ended lower after trading higher for much of the day.Semiconductors led technology shares higher after Texas Instruments raised its guidance for the coming quarter. But investors hesitated ahead of testimony on Thursday from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who is expected to provide guidance on the likelihood of further interest rate rises.Margaret Patel, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said low bond yields meant stocks remained attractive in spite of their dithering this year.Ms Patel said she was putting money into shares in speciality chemicals groups and other economically sensitive sectors.Texas Instruments rose 2.3 per cent to $27.90. The company said cost savings and a pick-up in demand should lead to profits at the high end of the expected range.National Semiconductor, an analogue chip rival, rose 0.3 per cent to $19.90.Shares in Intel, the world’s biggest maker of computer chips, traded 0.9 per cent higher at $27.10. The company is expected to give an update on its third-quarter prospects today.International Business Machines slipped 0.3 per cent after it said it would open up the source code of one of its computer chips to developers.Google, the internet search company, pulled back after nearing $300 a share on Tuesday. The shares fell 4.6 per cent to $279.56.Tobacco shares rose after the US Justice Department cut the amount of money it wants to claim from tobacco companies to help fund anti-smoking campaigns.Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, rose 1.4 per cent to $68.75. Reynolds American, which makes Camel cigarettes, rose 0.6 per cent to $83.48.IAC/InterActiveCorp, the media group controlled by Barry Diller, jumped 4.8 per cent to $25.81 after it agreed to sell its 5.4 per cent stake in Vivendi Universal, the entertainment group, to NBC Universal for $3.4bn.Shares in General Electric, which owns 80 per cent of NBC, fell 0.1 per cent on news of the deal.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, fell 1.2 per cent to $29.23 in spite of same-store sales rising in May.General Motors, the carmaker, rose 4.2 per cent to $32.02 after Kirk Kerkorian, the financier, raised his stake to 7.2 per cent. Mr Kerkorian fell short of his stated goal of raising his stake to 8.8 per cent.Siebel Systems fell 1.9 per cent after the software group gave in to shareholder pressure and declared a quarterly dividend. Investors had been clamouring for a piece of the company’s significant cash pile.
343;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-06-08T16:17:36Z;European bourses slip from three-year highs;;European semiconductor stocks got a boost on Wednesday from a rosy earnings forecast from Texas Instruments of the US, the world’s biggest maker of microchips for mobile phones.STMicroelectronics led the way with a rise of 2.4 per cent to €13.07, further helped by an upgrade from UBS.“We estimate that if STM successfully implements restructuring measures, it could achieve annualised cost savings of $800m a year from the second half of 2006,” said UBS analyst Jonathan Dutton.“We have raised our target price to €16 [from €10] and rating from ‘reduce’ to ‘buy’,” he added. STMicro shares traded as low as €10.83 at the end of April.Philips Electronics, the Dutch consumer electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, rose 2.3 per cent to €21.72. WestLB raised its price target for the stock from €22 to €25, citing the recent recovery of the share price of components producers and the record order for liquid crystal display screens placed yesterday with Philips by Hewlett Packard.Elsewhere in the sector, Infineon inched up 0.1 per cent to €7.33 while chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML added 0.5 per cent to €13.30.However, the broader market drifted back from Tuesday’s three-year high. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index slipped 3.3 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 1,123.6.Oil stocks were mixed in spite of a strong rebound for crude prices following news of an unexpected fall in US crude inventories.Royal Dutch fell 0.5 per cent to €48.39, Repsol YPF retreated 1 per cent to €20.02 but Total rose 0.2 per cent to €185.10.Norway’s Statoil rose 2.3 per cent to NKr121 after it said it was aiming to double its annual natural gas output to 50bn cubic metres by 2015.The banking sector continued to attract interest amid rumours that an agreed takeover for Germany’s HVB Group by Italy’s UniCredito could be announced as early as next week. A merger would create Europe’s ninth-biggest bank by market value.The two have reportedly yet to agree on a price but the deal is likely to be mainly or all in stock. A ratio of five UniCredito shares for each HVB share has been mentioned. That would value HVB at some €15.8bn or €21 a share.HVB shares rose 1.9 per cent to €20.40 while UniCredito added 0.1 per cent to €4.155.The cost of the bid could increase if UniCredito is required by the Austrian takeover panel to launch a bid for the 22.5 per cent of Bank Austria that HVB does not already own. Bank Austria shares edged back 0.4 per cent to €81.15 but rival Erste Bank climbed 2.2 per cent to €41.95.Meanwhile, Mediobanca jumped 4.3 per cent to a seven-year high of €15.29 following reports that it would be named as an advisor to UniCredito on its bid. The stock was the best performer in the Eurofirst 300.Deutsche Postbank rose 2.8 per cent to €40.94 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy” and raised its target price from €36 to €45.5.Postbank’s total profit growth potential was highly attractive, Deutsche said in a research note. “We see underlying profits in core business growing 10 per cent per annum,” the bank said.Postbank shares have risen some 25 per cent since the start of the year.On the results front, Remy Cointreau blamed hefty impairment charges for a big drop in its full-year profits.But the company said it still intended to take part in the industry’s consolidation in the medium term, and it predicted strong operating profit growth this year.Remy shares rose 2.5 per cent to €34.50.France Telecom fell 0.2 per cent to €22.75. Credit Suisse First Boston upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “outperform” and raised its revenue forecasts for 2005-07.“FT is showing encouraging trends in its wireline business. Broadband growth in France continues to accelerate, and FT has succeeded in stabilising retail market share in recent quarters,” CSFB said. It raised its price target by €1 to €26.Linde, the German engineering group, rose 1.6 percent to €59.25 after S&P revised its outlook on the company from “stable” to “positive”.Swiss-based rival ABB rose 3.1 per cent to SFr8.64 after Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch was said to have increased its price target on the stock from SFr8.5 to SFr9.5.

However, the market pared morning gains in afternoon trading.Investors also bought blue-chip exporters, taking advantage of cheaper share prices in the wake of yen strength in recent days.Japanese technology shares reacted to the news that Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest maker of microchips for mobile phones, had raised its second quarter earnings forecast.Printer and camera-maker Canon rose by 1.9 per cent to Y5,940. Advantest, the measuring instruments maker, increased by 1.4 per cent to Y8,110. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, rose by 0.5 per cent to Y3,910.Among carmakers heavily reliant on the export market, Nissan increased by 1.1 per cent to Y1,071, while Toyota rose more modestly, with a 0.3 per cent increase to Y3,840.Toho Zinc, the metal smelter, jumped by 14.6 per cent to Y330 after announcing it would produce indium - a metal used by manufacturers of liquid crystal displays and flat-panel computer monitors - for the first time in almost two decades.Consumer finance companies rose after a favourable report from Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Goldman said the sector had entered a cyclical recovery. It upgraded Japan`s biggest consumer finance company, Takefuji, to “outperform,” upgraded rival company Promise to “in line” from “underperform”, and added Aiful, another consumer finance company to its “current investment list.”Takefuji rose 2.3 per cent to Y7,060, Promise went up 2.4 per cent to Y6,700, and Aiful rose 3.8 per cent to Y8,100.Generic drugs makers gained after a report that the government wants to increase their use ito rein in health costs. Sawai Pharmaceutical rose by 10.4 per cent to Y3,290 and Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical increased by 4.4 per cent to Y995.
345;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Intel looks for mobiles break;;Intel on Thursday announced its latest attempt to break into the mobile phone market, with the release of a handset in Europe. The UK-based operator O will launch a camera and music phone next week featuring a re-engineered version of Intel's first-generation Manitoba processor, which had signally failed to attract handset makers and service providers since its introduction in 2003.Intel has been unable to penetrate a market dominated by Texas Instruments, with its expertise in PC processors challenged by the smaller power requirements and form factors of phones.But Sean Maloney, head of Intel's Mobility Group, presenting to journalists and analysts, said Intel's application processors for phones were gaining acceptance in the industry.“We feel we are finally getting traction, we are getting significant volume designs,” he said. “It's a totally new business for us, designing and developing a new architecture is a big deal, it takes a while.”He added that Intel was on track to release the second generation of its processor later this year. Intel would not reveal the handset maker behind the new phone, but said it had worked with the manufacturer beforeThe company also provided an update on its efforts to push a new wireless standard known as Wimax, which it said was complementary to 3G, offering broadband connectivity over wide areas.Mr Maloney said the company was hitting its milestones and its first Wimax chip, code-named Rosedale, was rolling out to customers. Sixty-eight carrier trials were taking place in 2005 of Wimax, which requires a new infrastructure.Intel also announced a verification programme for 3G similar to one it ran to promote the spread of wi-fi for notebook computers. It also announced a new service where notebooks could now be integrated with the Tivo To Go service, allowing TV programmes to be transferred wirelessly to laptops from the popular digital video recorder.
346;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Broadcom seeks injunction in IP war;;Broadcom, the semiconductor company, is seeking an injunction preventing Qualcomm, its larger rival, from selling a wide range of mobile phone chips that it claims infringes its patents.The litigation opens a new front in the intellectual property war between chip companies trying to secure a share of the likely profits from sale of third-generation mobile phones.Qualcomm has been involved in protracted litigation against Texas Instruments, which it claims broke the terms of a licensing agreement by selling chips based on its CDMA technology.Broadcom's action relates to technology used to combine voice services in a single 3G handset with digital video, digital audio, Bluetooth, data storage and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) capabilities.In addition to seeking an immediate injunction, Broadcom is asking the District Court for the Central District of California for unspecified damages.It has filed a separate action with the US International Trade Commission alleging that Qualcomm has acted unfairly by importing chips that infringe on its patents.“Qualcomm has not recognised the value of our intellectual property,” said Scott McGregor, Broadcom's chief executive. Qualcomm declined to comment.While litigation between chipmakers is common, analysts said Broadcom was being unusually agGressive by seeking an immediate injunction. Charlie Galvin, an analyst with Needham & Co, described the move as “a bit shocking” in a research note to clients.David Rosmann, Broadcom's vice-president for intellectual property litigation, said the request for an injunction was likely to be heard within a few weeks.The ITC case should go to trial in the early months of next year, he said, with the district court case heard later in 2006 or early in 2007, unless a settlement is reached in the meantime.
347;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-05-16T18:06:28Z;STMicro unveils more job cuts;;STMicroelectronics, the Franco-Italian chipmaker, announced an additional 1,700-1,800 job cuts on Monday, saying the continuing weakness of the dollar was forcing the company to restructure its cost base.The cuts come on top of some 1,200-1,300 cuts announced previously. The company said it planned to cut a total of 3,000 jobs outside Asia by mid-2006. This represents about 6 per cent of its global workforce of just under 50,000. Of the 3,000 jobs, about 1,500 will be transferred to Asia.Carlo Bozotti, STMicro's new chief executive, also told investors he was “considering all options” for the company's unprofitable flash memory division.The additional cuts had been widely expected after first-quarter results last month showed STMicro had fallen into the red, with a net loss of $31m compared with a profit of $77m. Much of this was due to the flash memory business, which made a loss of $62m.STMicro said it was suffering from slowing demand for its products, and from the weakness of the US dollar. Both STMicro and Infineon, the German semiconductor company, reported losses last quarter, in contrast to strong performances from Intel and Texas Instruments in the US.STMicro had said last month when reporting its loss that there were “signs of improvement in certain segments of the marketplace”, including the distribution market and a pick-up in wireless markets.However, it said it saw strong price pressure in several markets, notably memory. Research resources would be reallocated to “higher priority categories”.“On the one hand it is adverse currency effects, which have been going on for three years now,” said Sean Murphy, analyst at Nomura.“On the other hand it is a belated recognition that STMicro's European customers simply aren't as strong as they used to be.”STMicro is a key supplier of chips for European mobile phone operators, many of which have begun to suffer from competition from aggressive Asian challengers such as Samsung and LG.Mr Bozotti expects the company's restructuring efforts to save more than $500m a year from mid-2006.Its shares rose 0.4 per cent to €11.64, as investors said the restructuring measures fell short of expectations.
348;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-05-11T22:41:11Z;Texas raises the prices of simpler chips;;Texas Instruments, the second-largest chipmaker in the US after Intel, said on Wednesday it was raising prices of commodity chips to try to revive the fortunes of the low-cost silicon business.Kevin March, chief financial officer, told the company's annual analyst day in Dallas that volumes shipped of its less sophisticated chips had grown 70 per cent since 2002.?But at the same time we have seen significant price erosion, which has been averaging down our revenue growth rate and operating margins.?Texas Instruments was taking action by raising prices for its commodity logic and linear products, he said.Mr March said broadband had also been a disappointment for the company as it was suffering from the same industry pressures of commoditisation.?While we have enjoyed very robust growth, there has been a harsh pricing environment and R&D [research & development] expenditure for us.?To combat continuing operating losses, the broadband chip operations were being restructured to reduce costs. Texas would also focus on higher-value areas such as supplying digital signal processors (DSPs) for ?residential gateways?.These offered more services than low-cost data modems connecting to the internet, with video, wi-fi and voice over IP enabled by a doubling of the number of TI semiconductors in such modems.TI also said there was a near-term drag on its Digital Light Processing (DLP) business, whose optical semiconductor is used in advanced displays and projectors. Its customers had been over-optimistic about its 2005 growth and had created an inventory build-up.Nevertheless, the technology was driving down prices of new consumer projectors that would show films and television to as low as $599. More than 6m DLP chips had now shipped and they were present in 350 products.Rich Templeton, chief executive, told the meeting he believed passionately that TI was in the right markets at the right time. TI is the biggest provider of wireless chips in the world.?The cellphone may be the most important electronic product for the next ten years,? said Mr Templeton.
349;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-05-04T15:27:32Z;Market Insight: Investors losing their appetite as chipmakers turn sour;;It has been a painful few months for the European semiconductor industry.The region’s two biggest chipmakers, STMicroelectronics and Infineon, have seen their share prices tumble 24 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, since the start of the year. ASML, which manufactures chipmaking equipment, has fallen 3.4 per cent.By comparison, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index has edged up 2.5 per cent.Recent results from all three have been disappointing. Both STM and Infineon swung to a quarterly net loss after reporting a profit in the same period a year earlier.Even more worrying for investors were accompanying comments from both companies. STM warned of “strong price pressure, especially in memory”, while Infineon warned that it saw “no major improvement in demand” in the current quarter.While ASML unveiled a near five-fold rise in first quarter net profits, this was still short of expectations, and the company said it remained cautious on both its own outlook and the prospects for the industry.“The semiconductor industry is in the midst of a classic cyclical downturn – and increased pricing pressure, reduced order rates, falling utilisation rates and declining profitability have been the result,” says Stuart Adrian, analyst at Morgan Stanley.“What is true globally for the chip industry has been exaggerated in Europe as the dollar/euro currency devaluation has worked against the majority of players and new product cycles have been disappointing.”That view was backed up by the more upbeat tone of the leading US manufacturers.Texas Instruments reported first quarter net income that exceeded expectations. And Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, not only beat forecasts with its figures but also raised its capital spending forecast for this year.Cost-cutting is likely to be the key for European manufacturers in the near term, although some analysts remained sceptical about how long it would take for margins to improve.Sean Murphy at Nomura International, commenting on STM’s figures, said: “While cost reduction measures are under way and up to 10 per cent of research and development engineers are being ‘redeployed’, the message is of unremitting price pressure and tough market conditions. These are undeniably poor results.”Wolfgang Ziebart, Infineon’s chief executive, said he would continue to focus on cutting costs and that the main foundations of restructuring measures would be in place within four months.But Janardan Menon at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said while Infineon’s woes might be reaching an end, “in the short-term, it may be better to remain cautious on the stock”.For ASML, the chief worry was about declining orders. Goldman Sachs said the company’s cautious view on the order environment fitted with its similar outlook on the semiconductor cycle.Some might see the current share price weakness in the sector as a buying opportunity. But it could be a long wait before investing bears fruit.Stephen Pope, head of equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said: “At the moment, the investment community have decided that they can find better returns elsewhere and will only return to the sector when the industry is past the initial downward bend of the ‘J-Curve’ recovery.”
350;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-27T03:44:12Z;Infineon, STMicro swing to loss on restructuring;;Europe’s two largest chipmakers, Germany’s Infineon and Franco-Italian STMicroelectronics, announced on Tuesday they became loss-making businesses in the last quarter as they restructured their operations to become more competitive.Infineon issued a gloomy outlook for the next three months as it delivered a worse-than-expected loss for the second quarter. STMicro predicted sales growth of minus 1 per cent to 7 per cent after it announced a net loss of 3 cents a share compared with analyst forecasts of a profit of 2.5 cents.The poor figures underscored a divergence in the chip sector, which has suffered a downturn over the past three quarters. Intel and Texas Instruments of the US both posted strong results last week. But earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices was hit by weakness at its flash memory arm. STMicro said on Tuesday it was also suffering from strong pricing pressure in the memory chip market.“In the sector as a whole it looks like a mixed picture,” said Gunther Hollfelder, analyst at HVB. Referring to the strong results by the large US chipmakers and some smaller companies, he added: “This gives us some confidence that the bottom of the cycle will be reached in the first half.”Infineon made a net loss of E114m in its second quarter compared with a profit of E142m in the first, as it was burdened by a E74m charge for restructuring its wireless communications unit.It said it saw “no major improvement” in demand in the third quarter but hoped to earn a profit before interest and tax. The chipmaker also refused to comment on when the communications unit, which makes mobile phone chips, would return to profit. The division made an operating loss of E142m in the quarter as demand slowed across the mobile phone industry but in particular from Siemens, which is one of its biggest customers.Its other segments also suffered from a weakening performance with D-Ram memory chips, which generate about 40 per cent of group sales, seeing a fall in operating profit from E196m to E17m quarter-on-quarter.Wolfgang Ziebart, chief executive, said he would increase efforts to slash costs and shut loss-making businesses.His words were echoed by Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of STMicro. “ST is sharply focused on on improving the competitiveness of the company,” he said.This would mean fresh steps to streamline its cost structure including the closure of several non-manufacturing sites, he added.STMicro incurred $78m in impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs in its first quarter, compared to $33m a year earlier.Sales of $2.08bn were down 10.5 per cent on the previous quarter but up 2.6 per cent compared to a year earlier. The net loss was $31m compared to a profit of $77m a year earlier.
351;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-20T16:32:49Z;Europe lower despite tech gains;;European shares finished lower on Wednesday as US inflation data suggested there could be a heightened pace of monetary policy tightening in the world’s largest economy. This was after early gains driven by a buoyant technology sector.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,064.63.Fiat, Italy’s largest carmaker, hit a fresh all-time low amid continuing concerns over the company’s future.Chairman Luca di Montezemolo reaffirmed that there was no problem with liquidity at the company. Speculation about liquidity problems had led chief executive Sergio Marchionne to deny that the company was in talks to renegotiate the terms of a €3bn convertible loan. However, analysts remained concerned that the company had yet to make a statement on a restructuring plan, and predicted that the shares would remain under pressure until the market saw signs of action.Fiat fell 4.8 per cent to €4.533.European technology stocks benefited from forecast-beating first-quarter results from Texas Instruments and Intel in the US, with Intel upping its profits forecast for the year.ASML, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment, was the pick of the chip-related stocks, up 2 per cent to €11.75. German chipmaker Infineon added 0.7 per cent to €6.90.Mobile phone makers also received a boost, with Finland’s Nokia rising 1.8 per cent to €11.79 and Sweden’s Ericsson putting on 0.5 per cent to SKr20.10.French telecoms group Alcatel rose 2.2 per cent to €8.92 on speculation it was seeking closer ties with Thales, the defence electronics group. Both companies announced board changes on Tuesday, inflaming rumours that Alcatel was tightening its grip on Thales, in which it already owns 9 per cent.Austrian banks were among yesterday’s biggest risers. The sector has benefited this year as investors look to tap into growth in central and eastern Europe.JPMorgan singled out Erste Bank as one of its top picks in the European banking sector, saying it also saw domestic growth potential. Analysts rated the stock as “overweight” and said that they expected “strong earnings momentum to extend well into 2006 and 2007 driven by central and eastern European growth and gradual improvement in domestic Austrian business.”Erste Bank rose 2.8 per cent to €39.30 and rival Bank Austria moved 0.6 per cent higher to €73.42.Svenska Handelsbanken benefited from a broker upgrade, climbing 2.4 per cent to SKr171.50. Investment bank Carnegie raised the Swedish bank to “outperform” from “neutral” and said share buybacks or cash purchases were likely before the second quarter report. The broker noted Handelsbanken had the lowest gearing in the sector.Shares in Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, fell despite a flurry of broker upgrades on the back of Tuesday’s expectation-beating first-quarter results. Profit taking saw the stock fall 1.2 per cent SFr139.40, having hit a high for the year of SFr142.80 after Tuesday’s announcementElsewhere in the sector, German drugs and chemicals group Altana fell 1.4 per cent to €50.58. Worries over the performance of pantoprazole, its potential blockbuster ulcer treatment, led Citigroup to downgrade the stock to “sell” from “hold”. However, an initial 2.1 per cent sell-off was partially reversed as US drugmaker Wyeth beat expectations, reporting flat sales of its anti-ulcer medicine Protonix, which is made using Altana’s pantoprazole.Electrolux fell 1 per cent to SKr157 after results from the household goods maker failed to live up to expectations. First-quarter pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent and the core white goods unit saw profits fall 40 per cent. The rising cost of raw materials, especially steel, ate into costs. To cut costs the Swedish company, famous for the Zanussi and Frigidaire brands, warned it may close two factories - Fuenmayor, Spain, and Parabiago, Italy - and reduce two others.Schneider Electrical, the French electrical equipment maker, fell after it reported a 6.7 per cent rise in first-quarter sales and stuck to its full-year targets after strong growth in its American markets. However, a weaker European performance saw it miss analysts’ targets. “We see little opportunity for consensus earnings per share upgrades for Schneider in the current year,” said analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. Shares fell 0.4 per cent to €57.
352;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Acquisition of Artisan strengthens Arm;;Arm Holdings, the UK-based chip designer, on Tuesday reported a doubling of profits in the first quarter and reaffirmed plans to increase revenues by at least 20 per cent this year as its acquisition of US rival Artisan begins to pay off.Revenues in the three months to the end of March rose from ?35m to ?55m ($67m-$105m) year-on-year.Warren East, chief executive, said that, compared with pro-forma aggregated numbers for Arm and Artisan last year, revenues rose 23 per cent from $83.6m to $103.2m (?54m).?Ninety days into the new year we have already seen a 23 per cent rise. That is a good start,? he said.Fears over the integration of Artisan, which Arm bought for ?913m last year, were allayed as Artisan reported a 12 per cent rise in revenues to $24m.The announcement last August prompted Arm shares to fall by almost a fifth. However, the company said at the time that the deal would enable it to improve the value of the technology it sells to customers such as Intel and Texas Instruments for use in mobile phones, digital cameras, personal computers and other applications. It hoped to cross-sell to Artisan's customers mainly foundries that manufacture semiconductors.Last quarter, group revenues dipped from $25m to $15m owing to the strain of the integration process, and investors had been concerned the fall might prove more than a temporary blip.Mr East said he expected Artisan to record at least 20 per cent growth over the year. There was also further evidence that cross-selling opportunities from the acquisition were beginning to materialise, as two Artisan licences were sold to Arm customers in the first quarter.Licence revenues, the one-off payments Arm receives for the use of its chip designs, increased from ?14m to ?24.7m, as Arm signed 17 new licensing deals, including nine with new customers.Royalties, which Arm receives from devices that use the company's chip designs such as mobile phones and iPod music players, rose from ?13.4m to ?20.9m, with Artisan accounting for 20 per cent.Pre-tax profit, excluding acquisition-related charges, doubled from ?9.4m to ?18.8m. Including the ?6m in acquisition charges and ?300,000 of deferred stock-based compensation, pre-tax profits for the first quarter were ?12.5m.Earnings per share were flat at 0.6p, which factored in the dilution following the issue of shares related to the Artisan deal.Shares in Arm, which have been heading downwards since the beginning of March, fell more than 2 per cent to close yesterday at 94?p.
353;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-19T20:47:13Z;Market Overview: Markets enjoy a bounce;;"World stock markets enjoyed a rebound on Tuesday as investors’ frazzled nerves were soothed by positive corporate results and muted US inflation data.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, suggested that US investors might have got carried away at the end of last week.“I seriously doubt that the bear is awakening from hibernation,” he said. “Although the market might not have seen its lows just yet, I would rate a sell-off from here as a buying opportunity.”By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 10,127.40. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,152.83, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 1,932.26.Sentiment received a lift from improved first-quarter earnings from Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones. Forecast-beating earnings from Coca-Cola and Pfizer added to the positive mood, although news of a $1.1bn quarterly loss at General Motors served to remind investors of some of their recent earnings concerns.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent to 1,070.90. Pharmaceutical stocks again spearheaded the advance following the release of strong first-quarter sales figures from Switzerland’s Roche.Asian markets also joined in the party, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 Average climbing 1.2 per cent, South Korean shares rising 0.8 per cent and Hong Kong climbing 0.7 per cent.On Monday, the Eurofirst suffered its biggest one-day fall for eight months while the Nikkei tumbled 3.8 per cent to a four-month low. Last week, the Dow recorded its biggest weekly fall for more than two years.The recent hefty sell-off in stock markets was foreshadowed by Merrill Lynch’s
latest survey of fund managers.Released yesterday but conducted in the week to April 10, this showed an increase in caution about the prospects for global growth, corporate profits and margins.Meanwhile, US financial services company State Street said that global investor confidence in April had suffered its sharpest drop in 10 months.And there was some grim news in Germany, where the ZEW indicator of German investor confidence fell to its lowest level since last December.But better news on the economic front came from the US producer prices
figures for March. The core Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.1 per cent month-on-month, less than had been expected, taking the year-on-year rate down to 2.6 per cent from 2.8 per cent.The dollar slipped after the PPI’s release as investors took the view that the Federal Reserve would maintain its measured pace of interest rate rises.“So far, oil prices have damped activity but had little impact on core inflation,” said Dominic White at ABN Amro. “If [today’s] CPI is similarly muted, rate expectations should ease further.”Sterling pushed higher against the dollar after strong UK inflation data rekindled the prospect that the Bank of England could raise interest rates again.US oil futures moved higher as gasoline prices increased following a series of refinery problems.On Nymex, May WTI settled up $1.92 at $52.29 a barrel. June Brent was $2.16 higher at $52.94.Gold edged up to its best level for about four weeks in Europe as the metal benefited from fund buying as the dollar weakened against the euro."
354;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-19T20:37:48Z;Earnings news drives gains on Wall Street;;Low expectations helped fuel a rally on Wall Street on Tuesday, as stocks pulled back from five-and-a-half-month lows. Better-than-expected first-quarter results from prominent companies helped offset falling shares in General Motors after the US automaker revealed a $1.1bn quarterly loss.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 10,127.40. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,152.83, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 1,932.26.The swing came as a welcome relief to investors frustrated as indices struggled to find direction on Monday. Last week, all three indices hit their sharpest declines of the year, and the Dow was hit with its biggest weekly loss since March 2003.Chris Johnson at Schaeffer’s Investment Research warned that investor jitters about a host of economic concerns meant that any gains could be short-lived. “Everything has to be just right for this market even to tread water,” he said.On Tuesday, data showed core producer prices rose in line with forecasts in March. A separate report showed a dramatic drop in housing starts, which David Greenlaw at Morgan Stanley said was likely a delayed result of poor winter weather.GM fell 0.4 per cent to $26.09 after reporting a $1.1bn quarterly loss, its worst three-month performance in 13 years. Investors had expected worse, and the low expectations helped keep losses in check. Ford, GM’s rival, which reports today, fell 0.6 per cent.Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, rose 5.5 per cent to $24.17 after better-than-expected results after the closing bell on Monday. Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor company, which was due to reported earnings after the close, rose 1.9 per cent to $22.63.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola Co rose 3.5 per cent to $42.40 in spite of an 11 per cent fall in net income. The results were better than some analysts had expected.Pfizer, the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals company, slipped 0.7 per cent to $27.42 after it reported lower profits and cut its year’s outlook. The company said tax charges on foreign profits and the suspension of its Bextra painkiller hit its bottom line.Johnson & Johnson, a rival to Pfizer, was flat at $68.58 after it reported earnings up 17 per cent.Elsewhere, Viacom, the owner of the CBS and MTV television networks, rose 1.6 per cent to $34.72 after posting higher profits. The company said it was interested in buying cable groups aimed at ageing baby boomers.Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, rose 1.5 per cent to $54.17 after it increased its quarterly dividend. The bank said net income fell 3 per cent in the first quarter.Earnings beat expectations for Lucent Technologies, the telecommunications equipment group as shares rose 10.6 per cent to $2.61.
355;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-18T22:34:50Z;Chip sector relief at TI earnings;;Texas Instruments, the largest supplier of silicon chips for mobile phones, soothed frayed nerves across the technology sector by meeting earnings targets and issuing better than expected guidance for the current quarter.Shares in the Dallas-based company gained $1.25 to $24.17 following the announcement, which came after the close of regular trading in New York.TI increased net profit by 12 per cent to $411m in the three months to March. Earnings per share were 14 per cent higher at 24 cents, up from 21 cents.?The market environment is improving,? said Rich Templeton, chief executive.Technology stocks fell sharply last week following disappointing earnings announcements from IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices. However, TI said demand for its products had improved during March and were contining at that pace.Although revenue was barely changed at $2.97bn, earnings were boosted by higher capacity utilisation at TI's chipmaking plants, lower administrative costs and the company's active share buyback programme.Almost $1.5bn was invested in the quarter to buy back 58m shares. A further $1.5bn remains available for investment.TI expects revenues in the current quarter to be $3bn-$3.24bn, with earnings of 25-29 cents. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of around 26 cents.The figures do not include any impact from the expensing of employee stock options, which will be required from next year by US securities regulators. TI plans to begin expensing options from the third quarter of this year, it said.TI last month scaled-back its outlook for the first and second quarters because of weaker than expected demand for big-screen televisions and projectors powered by its proprietary 'digital light processing' (DLP) chips. DLP revenue declined by 25 per cent as equipment manufacturers agressively cut inventory.Although the impact will continue to be felt in the current quarter, the rate of inventory reduction is expected to be less pronounced raising hopes that the DLP business will return to growth. DLP-powered televisions took 18 per cent of the US big screen TV market in December and January, TI said.Revenues from wireless chips used in both mobile phone handsets and wireless infrastructure equipment grew by 15 per cent as increased sales of 3G chips more than offset the expected decline on older, 2G technology.
356;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Wall St mixed as indices regain some ground;;US markets closed mixed on Monday as investors struggled to get to grips with conflicting earnings reports from a handful of prominent companies and a fresh round of mergers and acquisitions.The broader US indices regained some ground after their steep losses last week.By the closing bell, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,145.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 1,912.92.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,071.25, however, extending last week’s losses that saw the blue-chip index record its biggest weekly fall in more than two years.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Smith Barney, said investors had probably overreacted to a series of downbeat corporate reports and economic data last week. “There seems to be a greater punishment being meted out than is deserved,” he said.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said the sharp sell-offs in recent sessions had come in spite of seemingly solid underlying economic fundamentals. “The undertow is good,” said Mr Paulsen.He said that in spite of an expectation of slowing corporate earnings growth this year, many companies could see earnings growth rise into the double digits this quarter.3M, the diversified manufacturer and maker of Post-It notes, led decliners on the Dow. Its shares fell 6.1 per cent to $75.90 in spite of higher quarterly earnings. Net income rose 12 per cent but sales growth was the smallest in 2½ years.Adobe, the software group, fell 9.7 per cent to $54.77 after it agreed to buy Macromedia, maker of Macromedia Flash and other interactive online media applications, for $3.4bn in stock. Macromedia shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $36.72.Bank of America helped lift shares in financial groups, which were among the day’s best performers on the S&P 500.

357;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-04-15T11:21:34Z;Samsung Electronics’ profit halves;;Samsung Electronics? profits halved in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, worse than analysts had feared, as Asia's most valuable technology company suffered from an invidious combination of weak pricing power, oversupply, narrowing profitability and an unfavourable exchange rate.Coming on the back of IBM?s surprise announcement of first-quarter earnings that were substantially below expectations, Samsung?s results underline the challenges facing the IT sector.?This will contribute to negative sentiment in the industry ? IBM, Apple, Texas Instruments and now Samsung all reported disappointing earnings,? said Thomas Choi of PCA Asset Management in Seoul. ?But what?s most concerning is that consensus forecasts were not that aggressive so Samsung did not even beat conservative expectations.?Samsung ? the world's top flat screen maker, the second-largest chipmaker and the third-biggest mobile phone producer ? on Friday admitted that the second quarter would also be tough, but remained optimistic about the longer term.?The second quarter is seasonally weak but we will maintain solid earnings. And we expect to create earnings at a different level in the second half,? said Chu Woo-sik, head of investor relations.Samsung reported that net profits fell by 52 per cent to Won1,498bn ($1.5bn) in the first three months of the year. This was dragged down by a 4.2 per cent decline in sales revenue to Won13,810bn, the first fall in seven quarters.Its bottom line was hurt by a Won700bn hit it took from its bail-out of Samsung Card, its loss-making credit card affiliate of which it owns 47 per cent, and by the Korean won?s rapid appreciation against the US dollar since the beginning of last year. Samsung exports more than four-fifths of its products.The South Korean company experienced lower performance in all of its core divisions, although it said it expected to see across-the-board improvements in the second half.Operating profits from its liquid crystal display division were 97 per cent lower at Won20bn, while in its semiconductor business, operating profits fell by 22 per cent from the first quarter of last year to Won1,385bn.Although Samsung sold a record 24.5m mobile phones in the first quarter, operating profits fell by 33 per cent from a year earlier to Won841bn. Margins weakened from 26 per cent at the beginning of last year to 17 per cent in the latest period.Samsung said the business environment had been difficult in the first quarter because of the almost 20 per cent rise in the Korean won since the beginning of last year and the continued depression in the IT industry.?The biggest risk we are facing is the exchange rate, as most of our sales are made in dollars. If the won goes up further, we will face bigger difficulties,? Mr Chu said, adding that the won?s appreciation cut Samsung?s operating profit by Won900bn in the first quarter compared with a year ago.

The S&P was off 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4 per cent.Friday’s slump followed a closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the computer chip group. Intel raised its sales guidance and said profit margins were better than expected, but shares slipped 2.6 per cent yesterday to end the week at $24.20The report failed to breathe life into the beleaguered chips sector, which fell sharply after Texas Instruments narrowed its quarterly guidance on Tuesday.

Verizon, the biggest US telecommunications group, which has been stalking MCI, fell 0.2 per cent yesterday to $36.09.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, fell sharply after slower February sales growth sparked downgrades. Its shares fell 4.1 per cent for the week to $32.56.Delta Air Lines fell 14 per cent for the week after the company warned on Thursday that lower margins and high fuel costs would lead to significant losses in 2005. Oil prices and inflation held sway over market sentiment throughout the five-session period, as the price of the US crude benchmark approached the $55 a barrel mark.Analysts said that inflation fears, fuelled in part by the rising price of oil, were the key culprits behind the market’s steep mid-week losses. Those fears sparked a steep jump in bond yields on Wednesday and prompted a flight from equities.Among other stocks making news this week, the International Securities Exchange turned heads when its shares shot up 69 per cent on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering. Shares in the US’s first publicly listed options exchange closed 69 per cent higher for the week at $30.40.Energy stocks found little joy in rising oil prices as investors moved to cash-in positions.

Merrill Lynch on Wednesday was rumoured to have bought $897m worth of Exxon stock at a discount to the market price to execute a trade for an anonymous client. Traders said the move was probably the result of a big institutional investor liquidating its position in the company.Energy groups have been among the best-performing stocks over the past year.Mergers and acquisitions were also in the spotlight after two big deals were revealed on Monday. United Defense Industries agreed to a $4.2bn takeover by the US arm of BAE Systems, the UK defence group, sending shares up 25 per cent for the week to $73.08.Capital One Financial slipped 0.2 per cent for the week after it announced a $5.3bn takeover of Hibernia, the Louisiana-based bank. Hibernia shares ended the week 23 per cent higher at $32.70.Colgate-Palmolive added to the M&A buzz by dropping an anti-takeover provision three years earlier than originally planned. The move followed a big shake-up at the company and followed the $57bn merger between Procter & Gamble and Gillette, which has put pressure on other groups in the sector.Colgate shares fell 0.9 per cent for the week.
359;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-03-08T23:17:36Z;Wall St slides after TI narrows guidance;;Wall Street stocks slid on Tuesday after a disappointing earnings update from Texas Instruments put pressure on semiconductor shares.By the closing bell, the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.8 per cent to 2,073.55. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 1,219.40 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,912.62.The slide, which followed a mixed performance in the previous session, cast a further pall over a burgeoning rally that had appeared to be gathering strength late last week amid a fall-off in oil prices and an upbeat jobs report.The prospect of a slowdown in earnings and concerns about the sustainability of the US trade deficit have kept stock market gains in check this year, disappointing market watchers who had been hoping the sharp rally that closed out 2004 would continue through early 2005.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the market’s lacklustre performance was surprising given recent upward revisions to estimates for key economic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and business capital spending. “The fundamental things that drive performance have improved,” he said. “At some point you are going to see this market doing better as people recognise that the business conditions are better than expected.”Narrowed earnings guidance from Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, provided much of the downward momentum. TI shares fell 3.8 per cent to $26.34. Other chipmakers also suffered. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, slipped 1.2 per cent to $24.80. Qualcomm, TI’s chief rival, gave back 2.9 per cent to $36.29 following Monday’s 5 per cent rise. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which tracks a basket of chip stocks, drifted 1.4 per cent lower to 435.44.McDonalds led shares in food groups lower. The fast food chain fell 2.1 per cent to $33.48 after it reported February same-store sales up just 1.6 per cent – its worst performance since 2003.

Sunoco rose 2.1 per cent to $105.25.
360;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Market Insight: Earnings and commodities weigh on stocks;;Leading stockmarkets eased on Tuesday on concerns over a slowing earnings outlook amid resurgent commodity prices.Wall Street slipped further back from the 3½ highs scaled last week as a disappointing profits forecast from Texas Instruments, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors for mobile phones, added to weakening sentiment on the wider earnings outlook.By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Index fell 0.1 per cent to 10931.17 while the S&P 500 Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 1221.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.4 per cent to 2081.50.Strategists raised concerns that margin pressure will lead to progressive downgrades of current earnings forecasts. Earnings for companies in the S&P 500 Index are already expected to fall to about 11 per cent in 2005 from 23 per cent in 2004, according to consensus forecasts compiled by FactSet JCF.The pressure on margins is expected to come from possible interest rate rises and high prices for inputs like oil and metals. Prices for West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery leapt $1 to $54.90 a barrel on Nymex yesterday while metal prices saw sharp gains. Copper hit a 16-year high on the London Metal Exchange while aluminium struck a 10-year peak.Henry McVey, the Morgan Stanley strategist, said analysts were still too optimistic about the US earnings outlook despite downgrades since the start of the year.“After analysts under-estimated growth by 800 basis points last year, we think they are now over-estimating growth by 280bp this year - and that is after a 60bp reduction since January 1,” he said.Mr McVey said he saw risks to earnings in areas such as autos, technology and telecommunications. He said the market was “bifurcating between the Haves and Have Nots” in pricing power.“A pricing power leader like the energy sector is up 20 per cent year to date. meanwhile price takers like autos and technology hardware are down 11 per cent and 6 per cent respectively,” he said.“”We see the S&P 500 at 1250 by the year-ened but we think that far fewer stocks and sectors will take us there relative to 2003-04.”The commodity price rises partly reflected a fall in the dollar to its weakest level against the euro since early January as traders took a cautious stance on the US currency ahead of trade data on Friday.By mid-session New York trading, the dollar was down 1 per cent at $1.3339 to the euro, 0.8 per cent lower at $1.9294 against sterling, 0.5 per cent down at ¥104.55 against the yen.US treasuries also saw a sell-off as investors repositioned portfolios ahead of the auctions of 5-year and 10-year notes this week. By late morning in New York, the yield on the two-year note was up 2.5bp points at 3.623 per cent. The 10-year note yield was up 5.5bp at 4.369 per cent.Spreads on emerging market bonds over US Treasuries reached an all-time low. The asset class benchmark EMBI+ Index firmed to 329bp over US Treasuries in early trade - below the previous record of 332bp reached in October 1997.European stockmarkets mirrored the weaker US trend. The FTSEurofirst 300 Index dropped 0.58 per cent to 1100.6, weighed down by a disappointing outlook statement from Volkswagen and mixed results for a key drug of Sanofi-Aventis.On Asian stockmarkets, Tokyo ended a 8-day streak of gains as concerns over the performance of Vodafone’s Japanese business provided the trigger for profit taking. The Nikkei 225 Average finished down 0.3 per cent at 11,886.91, while the Topix index was 0.4 per cent weaker at 1,195.39.Sydney hit a new record high as firmer commodity prices and news of BHP Billiton’s bid for WMC Resources boosted mining issues. The market was also bouyed by news that Southcorp, the country’s largest wine maker, had invited brewing group Fosters to consider merger talks. The S&P/ASX 200 finished 0.1 per cent higher at 4,242.

363;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-03-07T23:49:27Z;Weaker TV sales hit demand for TI's chips;;Disappointing sales of flat-screen televisions over the holiday period led Texas Instruments, the Dallas-based semiconductor company, to predict lower than expected revenues and earnings for the current quarter.TI said sales of TVs and projectors powered by its proprietary ?digital light processing? chips were lower than expected in the last few weeks of 2004, leading to a build-up of inventory among manufacturers.?Customers are taking aggressive actions to reduce these inventories as quickly as possible,? it said.DLP is one of TI's most profitable and fastest-growing businesses, delivering revenue growth of 79 per cent during 2004. The technology allows consumer electronics companies to offer large, flat-screen TVs at prices lower than liquid crystal display or plasma alternatives.TI emphasised that DLP-based TVs and projectors had gained market share over rival technologies in 2004. However, end-of-year sales were weaker than manufacturers had expected.Revenue for the three months to March is now expected to be $2.9bn$3bn, towards the lower end of the $2.9bn$3.15bn range forecast by the company in January.In a conference call with equity analysts, Ron Slaymaker, TI spokesman, said all but $10m of the revenue shortfall was attributable to the DLP business.On this basis, sales of DLP chips appeared to have undershot the company's quarterly targets by about $65m.Earnings per share would also be lower than analysts had been expecting. TI said first-quarter earnings would be 22-24 cents, at the lower end of its range.The consensus forecast was for earnings of 24 cents.DLP chips account for a relatively small portion of TI's overall semiconductor business, which produces chips for mobile phones, digital cameras and other consumer electrics devices.TI stock shed $1.02 to $26.35 following the announcement on Monday, a decline of 4 per cent.
364;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-03-02T23:46:17Z;Intel chases larger share of mobile market;;Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, has detailed a triple-pronged assault on a mobile phone market it has so far failed to crack, with new chipsets, flash memory products and further development of the WiMAX standard on the way.Sean Maloney, head of its recently formed Mobility Group, told the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Wednesday that its first chipset for third-generation phones to ship in volume codenamed Hermon would appear this year.Rivals Texas Instruments and Qualcomm have dominated the cellphone market. Craig Barrett, Intel chief executive, said at the forum that this was the one major sector where Intel needed to improve.Intel has been more successful with ?NOR? flash memory chips that retain data in mobile phones after they are switched off. It has regained market leadership from AMD over the past few quarters and announced its newest flash memory family codenamed Sibley would feature chips with 512MB of memory ideal for storing digital photos and music.?The reason we have been successful over the past nine months is not price cuts, it's technology,? Mr Maloney said.Intel has also been championing WiMAX technology, which is an extension of wi-fi, allowing broadband internet connections over a much wider area.WiMAX is seen as a possible threat to the business models of mobile operators who have spent billions on 3G licences, but its development and deployment is trailing that of 3G by at least two years.Mr Maloney said the number of engineers working in the industry on WiMAX had grown tenfold in the past year while members supporting its development in the WiMAX Forum had grown from 46 to 244. WiMAX trials by carriers had grown from two to 15 and were expected to reach 75 by the end of the year.?The current specification is portable and there are some in the community that want to push it to the next level,? he said. ?The $64,000 question is whether it will replace 3G and the answer is no. By the time it's out there, [3G] will be deployed in a lot of countries and you will see WiMAX coming along and overlaying it.?
365;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-02-23T21:28:00Z;Wall St higher as inflation concerns ease;;Wall Street regained ground on Wednesday in the wake of Tuesday’s stormy session, as investors welcomed data showing that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 10,673.79, and the S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,190.80. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,031.25.The rally came as welcome relief to shell-shocked investors, who were left reeling on Tuesday after a sharp fall in the dollar and a spike in oil prices led the Dow and the S&P 500 to their biggest single-day fall in months.Concerns about mounting inflation and the sustain-ability of the US trade deficit have cast a shadow on trading in recent weeks. But investors received a respite on Wednesday after official US data showed that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.François Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Steans, said in a research report that rising prices could be a sign of a return to a pattern of higher inflation after years of lower price increases.“While we believe it is still early to say whether we have reached a secular turning point, we feel compelled to point out that a return of inflation cannot be assumed to be favourable for equities,” he said.Technology stocks were the focus of early attention in an otherwise quiet day for corporate news.Semiconductors led decliners on the S&P 500. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip company, shed 1.9 per cent to $23.31. Its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 2.4 per cent to $16.60.Texas Instruments, the pocket calculator and microchip maker, slipped 0.4 per cent to $25.47. Motorola , the mobile handset maker, fell 0.9 per cent to $15.42 after it restated fourth-quarter earnings.Healthcare stocks were also in the spotlight after Medco Health Solutions, the pharmacy benefits manager, announced a $2.2bn deal to buy Accredo Health, the drug store services provider. The news sent Accredo shares soaring almost 40 per cent to $42.11. Medco shares slipped 0.7 per cent to $43.14.Elsewhere, Lowe’s, the hardware chain, rose 0.6 per cent to $57.90 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings up 27 per cent.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods giant that last month announced a $57bn deal to buy Gillette, a rival, was one of the biggest gainers on the Dow. Shares in P&G rose 2.4 per cent to $53.49 following an analyst upgrade. Gillette shares rose 2 per cent to $50.75.Goodyear, the tyremaker, was one of the day’s biggest gainers. Its shares rose 6.7 per cent to $14 after it said it expected to make a profit in the fourth quarter.Shares in food processors were lower after Archer Daniels Midland said it would not raise corn syrup prices this year - a signal that food processors are likely to continue to struggle against stiff competition and a lack of pricing power this year. ADM shares, which were also hit by an analyst downgrade, dropped 7.3 per cent. Shares in ConAgra, a rival, fell 3.2 per cent to $26.62. Bunge, the second-biggest US food processor, rose 0.6 per cent to $51.16.

But the leading US indices all closed higher for the week amid a raft of earnings reports and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent on Friday to 10,427.20. The S&P500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 1,171.36, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6 per cent to 2,035/83.For the week, the Dow closed 0.3 per cent higher. The S&P500 rose 0.3 per cent and the Nasdaq edged up 0.1 per cent. The stronger performance partly reflected anticipation of easing uncertainty after Iraqi elections on Sunday.The stock market rallied sharply in October and November following the US presidential elections. But market watchers yesterday offered differing opinions as to whether Wall Street can expect a similar outcome next week after the elections in Iraq.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that sabotage or other attacks against oil assets could affect the markets in the short run. “There is an uncertainty that a big event could happen there, and that alone is probably worth $5 in crude prices,” he said. Stock market performance has been tied closely to the oil price in recent weeks.Richard Bernstein, chief US quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that although oil prices were likely to drive trading in the short term, the election’s outcome could also shed light on other long-term concerns. “There is an issue of oil, but there is also an issue of how long we are going to be in Iraq,” he said.P&G’s monster merger was the focus of attention yesterday after Thursday’s flat performance, which brought Wall Street’s brief two-day rally to a halt. News of the deal sent Gillette shares up nearly 13 per cent to $51.60 yesterday for a weekly gain of 17 per cent. P&G shares ended the week down 2.7 per cent at $54.15.Other deals this week included SBC Communicationss planned takeover of AT&T, the long-distance carrier. AT&T shares rose 9 per cent for the week after gaining more than 6 per cent after the deal was first reported on Thursday. Shares in SBC, the second-biggest US telecoms group, were down 7.7 per cent for the week at $23.62.Magnum Hunter Resources, the oil and gas group, was up more than 11.5 per cent for the week at $14.69 after rival Cimarex Energy revealed takeover plans. Cimarex fell more than 9 per cent.With earnings season in full swing, investors welcomed a series of upbeat reports from prominent companies. Most S&P500 companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations.Sme analysts said that, after the market’s bull run to round out 2004, an expectation of outperformance had been priced in. But a rally on Tuesday and Wednesday indicated that investors were willing to reward companies for their fourth-quarter performance.Texas Instruments, the computer chip company, surged more than 7 per cent on Tuesday after its earnings brought upgrades from two prominent investment banks. Shares in the company rose nearly 10 per cent for the week to $23.11.Other stocks met with investor ire in spite of improved profits. Norfolk Southern, the biggest US railroad, was on track to end the week down 3.5 per cent after falling more than 5 per cent on Tuesday. The fall came in spite of a five-fold increase in quarterly profit.Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, fell 3.6 per cent this week to $53.70 in spite of higher quarterly earnings. Earnings disappointments stopped the rally in its tracks on Thursday. Caterpillar, the construction equipment group, led laggards on the Dow. Its shares fell 2 per cent on the week to $87.46.Merck, the drugs group, fell 10.1 per cent on Friday as US regulators stepped-up an investigation into the company’s handling of the Vioxx painkiller crisis and a court made an adverse ruling on a key patent. The shares fell 7.7 per cent for the week.
367;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-01-26T22:48:25Z;Market Overview: German growth hint lifts euro;;"World stock markets lacked a clear direction on Wednesday in spite of another round of encouraging US corporate earnings and a hint of improvement in Germany's economy, the biggest in the eurozone.Wall Street made further gains as sentiment remained buoyed by forecast-beating results from the likes of Eli Lilly, the drugs group, and the chipmaker Texas Instruments.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4 per cent at 10,498.44, although that was well off an early high. The Dow climbed 0.9 per cent on Tuesday - its best one-day advance so far this year.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index ended up 1.3 per cent.But in Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index pared an early advance to close just 0.03 per cent higher at 1,054.81, after earlier pushing above the 30-month closing high recorded a few weeks ago.Early support for European shares came from the latest survey from the German Ifo economics institute, which showed that business confidence in January had risen to its highest level for 11 months.""This latest Ifo index is still only consistent with [gross domestic product] growth in 2005 of a little above 1 per cent, and lower than the government's 1.6 per cent forecast,"" said Rob Carnell, eurozone economist at ING Financial Markets. ""But the hint of a change in Germany's growth dynamic is a promising development.""The data gave the euro a lift against the dollar, particularly in the wake of Tuesday's news that the German government had cut its forecast for economic growth for the third time in nine months.The yen was also in focus as it recovered some of its recent decline against the dollar after Monday's steep fall as talk that China could revalue the renminbi resurfaced. A revaluation would give the currencies of other Asian countries more room to rise without risking the competitiveness of their exports against China's.Beijing said yesterday it would discuss its pegged currency regime at next week's conference of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries. That flew in the face of recent remarks by a Chinese official that his country did not have the conditions to adjust the exchange rate at the moment.However, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein remained sceptical about the likelihood of a renminbi revaluation. ""Even if a small tinkering of the regime is carried out, we do not expect to see more than say a 5 per cent stronger renminbi in two years' time,"" said analyst Tatha Ghose. ""This would not have macroeconomic consequences.""Meanwhile, news that China had replaced the US as Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004 gave a boost to shares in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.9 per cent, with steel stocks leading the way on hopes that Chinese demand would remain strong.Data on Tuesday showed that China's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 9.5 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2004.Oil prices were volatile following a mixed batch of US inventories figures. March futures on Nymex in New York closed down 86 cents at $48.78. March Brent in London was 45 cents down at $46.51.The American Petroleum Institute reported a sharp fall in gasoline, distillates and crude oil stocks, although the federal Energy Information Administration reported a jump in crude inventories.Gold rose more than $4 an ounce as the metal took its lead from the rising euro, although it remained about $3 down from its level at the start of the year."

Cimarex shares fell 10.3 per cent to $36.06.Many investors view the oil and gas sector as ripe for further consolidation following a run-up in energy prices in 2004 that left many producers with healthy balance sheets and big cash piles.The S&P 500 energy index, which tracks 29 oil and gas stocks, has almost doubled in value since January 2002.An analyst at AG Edwards said: ""The majors got out of North America years ago, and now it's been the smaller companies that have begun developing resources that have once again become attractive.""Fast food companies brushed off a decision by a US appeals court to reinstate an obesity-related lawsuit against McDonald's.Shares in McDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, rose 0.2 per cent to $31.99. Yum! Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC chains, rose 0.3 per cent to $45.73.Shares in both groups have more than doubled since March 2003, in spite of mounting concerns about fast food's alleged contribution to America's growing obesity problem.Semiconductors led gainers on the S&P 500 for a second successive day after results at Texas Instruments earned upgrades from Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. Shares in the computer chip company jumped 7.3 per cent to $22.66.International Business Machines dipped 0.3 per cent to $91.95 after US lawmakersraised concerns about the proposed sale of its personal computer division to Lenovo, the Chinese computer group.SBC Communications,the second-largest US telecommunications group, rose 0.5 per cent to $24.58 in spite of lower earnings.Transport stocks led decliners in spite of afive-fold increase in quarterly profit at Norfolk Southern, the biggest US railway company. Norfolk shares fell 1.8 per cent t o $34.08.The S&P 500 transportation index rose more than 30 per cent in 2004 but has dropped 10 per cent from its December peak.Genentech, the biotechnology company, rose 2.1 per cent to $48.45 after Merrill Lynch offered upbeat comments on the company's earnings potential."
369;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-01-26T17:50:03Z;IPods and mobile phones fuel growth at ARM;;Sales and profits rose sharply in the fourth quarter at ARM Holdings, boosted by strong Christmas sales of mobile phones and Apple's iPod music players, which contain chips designed by the company.The UK-based semiconductor designer saw sales rise 22 per cent to £41.5m ($78.1m) in the quarter to the end of December, while pre-tax profits more than doubled to £5.3m compared with the same quarter the previous year. For the full year, sales were up 19 per cent at £152.9m, and pre-tax profit rose 82 per cent to £42.2m. This month, Apple reported a sixfold surge in sales of iPods during the Christmas period and a quadrupling of fourth-quarter profit.At the same time, a number of mobile manufacturers, which also use ARM-designed chips in their handsets, have reported sharp rises in fourth-quarter sales. Texas Instruments, the world's largest maker of mobile phone processors, said on Tuesday that demand for phones during the Christmas period had lifted revenues to a nine-year high.More than two-thirds of ARM's shipments were to the wireless industry.Warren East, chief executive, said he was expecting sales to increase by at least a further 20 per cent this year, despite predictions that conditions were likely to get tougher for the semiconductor industry overall.He said: “It will be a fairly flat year for the industry but ARM is designed into growth areas such as mobile phones.” Confidence has been underpinned by an increase in the company's order backlog, which at the end of December was up 30 per cent from the previous year. But analysts were disappointed by performance at Artisan, the US rival it bought for £913m just before Christmas. Artisan's fourth-quarter revenues, came to just $15m, compared with $25m in the previous three months. ARM said, however, that the Artisan business was expected to expand by 20 per cent this year.Earnings per share rose from 1.5p to 3.1p, and a full-year dividend of 0.7p is recommended, representing a 17 per cent rise from last year's 0.6p. The shares fell 6¾p to 98p.
370;TXN;Texas Instruments;2005-01-16T16:21:15Z;Choosing the right track;;"General Motors looks as if it is about to make a three-point turn. The world's largest car company is in talks to sell its Electro-Motive locomotive division. If the sale goes ahead, GM will be able to concentrate on building cars and trucks for the first time since the 1920s.The surprise is that it has taken so long. For 25 years, management gurus and investors have been imploring US companies to sell their non-core businesses. It has become an article of faith that focus is good.But the choice between diversification and focus is less clear-cut than it might seem. Recent studies have cast doubt on the widely accepted notion that the stock market values diversified companies at a discount. Moreover, the way in which most investors measure diversification - by reference to broad industry sectors - can be misleading.Diversification was not always unfashionable. Roll back to the 1970s and the US stock market was dominated by conglomerates such as General Electric, Westinghouse and Texas Instruments. As well as cars, trucks and locomotives, GM served up everything from Frigidaire home appliances to earthmoving equipment.The poor performance of the US economy through the 1970s created pressure for change. Investors, angry at the dismal performance of US equities for much of the decade, pressed for radical action to improve returns - even if that meant the break-up of big companies.Evidence also emerged that companies with focused strategies were more successful at withstanding the competitive onslaught from Japan. In In Search of Excellence, published in 1982 and arguably the first management blockbuster, Robert Waterman and Tom Peters advised companies to ""stick to their knitting"" - a recommendation based on a McKinsey survey of the best-performing US companies.Thus the scene was set for the leveraged takeover boom of the 1980s, culminating in the forced, multi-billion dollar break-up of RJR Nabisco, the tobacco-to-cereals group. The proportion of US stock exchange-listed companies operating in a single industry increased from 38 per cent in 1979 to 58 per cent in 1988.Unbundling continued during the 1990s, often through voluntary spin-offs rather than hostile takeovers. Thus Texas Instruments got out of home computers and defence electronics to focus on semiconductors; Westinghouse evolved into CBS, the media group; Imperial Chemical Industries spun out its pharmaceuticals business; and Hanson, a predator during the 1980s leveraged takeover boom, dismantled itself.The snag for believers in focus is that conglomerates - GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Siemens - have continued to top polls of the world's most respected companies. Moreover, academics are divided on the question of whether diversified companies underperform on average.In a landmark paper published in 1995, Philip Berger and Eli Ofek found that diversified companies were valued by the US stock market at a discount of between 13 per cent and 15 per cent to the imputed value of their parts. Evidence for a similar but smaller ""diversification discount"" was found in the UK and Japan.There are many plausible reasons for such a discount. Most academics blame so-called ""agency conflicts"". A conglomerate structure, it is argued, gives managers opportunities to act in ways that are detrimental to shareholders. For example, they might allocate capital according to criteria that have more to do with empire-building than superior returns. Yet recent research has cast doubt on whether the discount exists at all. A study led by John Graham, a financial economist at Duke University, found that businesses acquired by conglomerates tend to be underperforming - and therefore valued at a discount - in the first place. This implies that diversification does not, in itself, destroy value. ""Is there a diversification discount? The jury is still out,"" he says.Moreover, there is scant evidence of agency conflicts. According to one recent paper by Chris McNeil and other academics, managers of poorly performing business units within diversified companies are more likely to lose their jobs than chief executives of stand-alone companies. This implies that conglomerates act more quickly than equity markets when faced with evidence of under-performance.Another reason for caution is that each of these studies measured only one dimension of diversification: the number of industry sectors (measured by standard industrial classification codes) in which a company operates.Managers deciding whether to expand into a new market must also consider the nature of the business in terms of capital intensity, purchasing behaviour, the competitive characteristics of the market and a host of other factors.For example, International Business Machines would on many measures be viewed as highly focused, since it concentrates on selling information technology products and services to corporate customers. Yet the group spans everything from semiconductors - a deeply cyclical, capital-intensive business with long planning horizons - to management consulting. Does that make Big Blue a specialist or a quasi-conglomerate?Gary Hamel, visiting professor at London Business School, says: ""Diversification as it is classically defined [according to industry sector] tells you very little about how well a company is run. You need to drill down much, much deeper before deciding whether a strategy makes sense.""TAKE SLOW AND STEADY STEPS WHILE YOU GROW - OR YOU COULD FALL FLAT ON YOUR FACEIf focus is good and diversification bad, how are companies expected to grow?• In ‘Beyond The Core’ (2004), Chris Zook, head of the strategy practice at Bain Co, the consultancy, argues that most successful growth initiatives take place in markets that are adjacent to a company’s existing business. This can mean finding new customers for existing products, offering new products to existing customers, offering existing products to existing customers through a new channel and so on.Problems arisewhen companies try to take two or three steps at once - for example, offering existing customers a new product through a new channel.His message is: think carefully and move steadily. Big leaps into unknown markets are likely to fail.• In ‘Leading the Revolution’ (2000), Gary Hamel, avisiting professor at London Business School, argues for a more radical approach. He thinks ideas for new businesses are as likely to come from within companies asfrom a strategy committee. The trick is to findways to harness the creative energy.But, like Mr Zook, he warns against big bets in markets where the organisation has little experience.• Even measured moves into adjacent markets can end in disaster. A common pitfall is to allow management attention to be drawn away from the core business. In the 1990s, Ford expanded into automotive servicesand acquired brands such as Volvo and Jaguar. But it neglected to develop world-class models for its core car business. This cost Jac Nasser his job as chief executive.GM faces similar issues in its core business, even as it starts to focus on cars and trucks. For evidence of how much work needs to be done, just get behind the wheel of a new Pontiac or Saturn."

Other action was limited amid a dearth of corporate news.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 10,800.82. The S&P 500 was marginally firmer at 1,213.55, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1 per cent to 2,178.34.Traders, pundits and investors brimming with anticipation at the prospect of a so-called ""Santa Claus rally"" to end the year have been disappointed by the stock market's lacklustre performance in the first days of post-Christmas trading.Bulls took heart in the penultimate trading session of the year, however, as oil briefly fell back below $42 per barrel and US figures showed a bigger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims.Boeing, the aerospace group, took centre stage after it announced it had won a $1.3bn order for 10 of its new 7E7 Dreamliner commercial jets from Continental. But Boeing shares gave up early gains to fall 0.3 per cent to $51.90.Defence stocks edged higher despite a New York Times report that the Pentagon plans drastic spending cuts. Lockheed Martin rose 0.6 per cent to $55.60. Northrop Grumman edged up 0.3 per cent to $54.76.Airlines recovered some of their recent losses, with AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, up 1.6 per cent to $10.98. Continental Airlines rose 1.9 per cent to $13.70 and Delta Air Lines jumped 0.8 per cent to $7.51. US Airways fell 6.6 per cent to $1.14, however, as its Comair subsidiary continued to struggle to clear a backlog of lost luggage from cancelled flights on Christmas.Steelmakers led decliners amid mounting concerns that a flood of Chinese steel exports could lead to falling prices. US Steel fell 5.5 per cent to $50.04, while Nucor, a rival, dropped 6.4 per cent to $51.38. Allegheny Technologies, another steel maker, declined by 3.4 per cent to $21.38.Semiconductors were broadly higher. Applied Micro Circuits rose 5.9 per cent to $4.14, while Texas Instruments rose 0.7 per cent to $24.51. Intel, the world's biggest chip group, was flat at $23.35.Pfizer shares fell 0.9 per cent to $27.01 after the Wall Street Journal reported that prescriptions for the company's Celebrex painkiller fell by more than 50 per cent last week."

CSFB said in its report.The brokerage also suggested Intel and Advanced Micro Devices faced challenges next year as they transitioned to dual-core processors, the equivalent of putting two chips in one package.?We believe dual core will require heightened execution and yield risk (more complex architecture with two cores that need to yield) increasing the chance for an operational miscue in (the second half of 2005) from product delays,?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 10,494.15.The leading market indices have been trading within a tight range over the past month. A sharp rally in late October and early November pushed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to gains of more than 7 per cent for the year.With expectations running high for earnings growth - and the weakening dollar boosting US multinationals - the market looks poised to end the year firmly positive, which would secure decent year-end bonuses in lower Manhattan.However, a few bearish voices cautioned against reading too much into the recent strength.""There's a lot of cash that investors want to put to work, and December is usually a pretty good month to do it,"" said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.""But with the world economy sending off some very problematic signals, there's an awful lot of risk at play here.""Crude oil futures fell briefly below $41 per barrel, touching a 4-month low in morning trading. But they later rebounded to settle at just below $42 per barrel after US government data showed the increase in heating-oil supplies running well below last year's tally heading into winter. Crude futures remain off sharply from the $56 per barrel that they hit last month.Oil's steep fall has led some members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to call for production cuts ahead of a meeting of the cartel on Friday.But other Opec members, including Saudi Arabia, have questioned whether there is any need for the organisation to act.""There's been a lot of talk about the dollar, but the main concern for the stock market is the price of oil - and the fear that it will be a tax on the consumer,"" said Ed Yardeni, chief strategist at Oak Associates.In stock activity, Sirius Satellite Radio, the satellite radio company, dropped 23.5 per cent to $6.90 following a critical article in the Wall Street Journal and analyst downgrades on the high-flying stock.The sharp fall erased Tuesday's 11 per cent gain, which came as the group unveiled a deal to offer its radios as a factory-installed option in Toyota cars. Rival XM Satellite eased 1 per cent to $38.00.International Business Machines was in the spotlight as it confirmed plans to sell its personal computer division to Lenovo, the Chinese computer company, for $1.75bn.The deal, which was first reported on Monday, would let IBM focus on the market for business services and make Lenovo the world's third-biggest personal computer supplier. Shares in IBM increased by 0.6 per cent to $96.65 in afternoon trading.Texas Instruments, the maker of calculators and mobile telephone microchips, fell 3.8 per cent to $24.06 after it said it expected fourth-quarter revenues to fall in the middle of their anticipated range.Merck, the drugs company whose blockbuster pain medication Vioxx was withdrawn from the market last month because of health concerns, rose 2.9 per cent to $28.69 as it confirmed its 2004 earnings outlook. The New Jersey-based company warned that earnings in 2005 could be lower than analysts' estimates, however, because of the loss of Vioxx sales.Pixar, the animated film studio, fell 4.7 per cent to $86.77 after it said it would delay the release of its latest feature, Cars, until June 2006.

""We believe TI's proposed merger adds value and raises our target price [for TI shares] by €0.20 to €3.20,"" said Hannes Wittig at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.Paul Norris at Lehman Brothers said that the €14.5bn cash return was a ""strong positive"" for the European telecoms sector. But Nick Lyall at Morgan Stanley said that higher debt removed the scope for buybacks and raising the dividend.TIM shares ended the day with a gain of 5.7 per cent to €5.46, while Telecom Italia rose 3 per cent to €3.04.However, the Nordic telecoms operator TeliaSonera tumbled 4.2 per cent to SKr39.20 as it suffered a double blow. The company said it was writing down the value of its International Carrier networks unit to zero, and that fourth-quarter group profits would be lower than expected.Meanwhile, the Finnish government also said it was selling 250m shares in TeliaSonera, or 5.3 per cent of the company, as part of its continuing privatisation programme.Car manufacturers moved higher as the dollar staged a rally and investors were encouraged by some positive sales figures from the sector. The recent dip in oil prices also lent a helping hand.Porsche led the way with a rise of 4 per cent to €501 after it said sales in the four months to the end of November had risen 7 per cent from a year earlier, mainly due to strong demand for its 911 sports car and Cayenne off-road models.And BMW gained 2.4 per cent to €32.80 after it unveiled a 10th consecutive month of rising group car sales in November. Elsewhere, Renault gained 1.3 per cent to €60.30 and Volkswagen firmed 1 per cent to €34.25.But Arcelor, the world's biggest steelmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to €16.16 even though it said it expected to increase its sales volumes to the European vehicle industry by 5 per cent next year.Nutreco and CSM, the Dutch food groups, rose 7 per cent to €21.17 and 6.5 per cent to €23.40 respectively on talk that they were in strong positions to take part in ongoing sector consolidation.Technology shares came under pressure after the US chipmaker Texas Instruments said it expected its fourth-quarter revenues and earnings per share to come in at the middle of its previous estimates.ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment group, fell 2.8 per cent to €12.14, Germany's Infineon shed 1.8 per cent to €8.32 and the Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics finished 0.7 per cent lower at €15.19.Perlos, the Finnish mobile handset casings maker, fell 3 per cent to €12.50 after it warned that its current record profitability would not be sustainable in the long term.In the financial sector, Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro rose 2.9 per cent to €1.94 amid speculation that it had moved a step closer towards a merger with a domestic rival."

Mr Barrett said.In recent weeks, a number of chip companies have forecast a slowdown in the first half of 2005.Texas Instruments announced on Tuesday that it was narrowing its forecasts for the quarter ending December 31, due to inventories not being cleared in distribution channels.It said it expected sales of between $3.02bn and $3.14bn, compared to earlier forecasts of $2.96bn to $3.2bn. Earnings per share should be between 25 and 27 cents compared to 24 and 28 cents, it added.
376;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-25T17:40:57Z;A highly calculated recovery act;;"If disco was the soundtrack to the 1970s, Texas Instruments was the brand. We wore TI digital watches, used TI calculators, learned to read with TI Speak'n Spell machines and cut our teeth on TI home computers.But like other aristocrats of US technology - Xerox, International Business Machines, Motorola - the Dallas-based company found the 1980s and 1990s much harder going. In watches, it was no match for nimble Japanese competitors such as Casio. In computers it lost out to the likes of Atari, Commodore and Apple. In microprocessors, Intel was the overwhelming victor. In computer memory, Japan Inc again took the spoils.Every few years, pundits would declare TI ready for a comeback. But somehow the comeback never came. The company that employed 100,000 at the peak of its power now has a workforce of 30,000. The TI logo is found mainly on silicon chips buried deep inside products from companies such as Nokia and Sony.Rich Templeton, TI's intense young chief executive, is too focused on the present to dwell on the past. But the 45-year-old engineer saw history unfold at first hand. In 1980, when he joined TI as a graduate sales rep, the company was at its zenith. Now he is out to prove that it is on the way back up. ""Customers like Nokia can place big bets on us because they know we will deliver. We know about cost and quality. We are tenacious,"" he says.On Wall Street, investors and analysts are starting to agree. TI is widely regarded as well-placed to benefit from growth in sales of mobile phones, digital music players, digital cameras and other electronic gadgets. ""Our meeting with Texas Instruments last week confirmed excellent long-term growth prospects,"" wrote Andrew Root, semiconductor industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, following a visit to the company in August.Charlie Galvin at Needham & Co concurred: ""It is hard to believe that a well-run company the size of Texas Instruments could be overlooked, but that is precisely what we believe has happened.""Sure enough, TI shares have roundly outperformed Intel's since those reports were written. Last week, TI announced third-quarter revenues of $3.2bn (£1.7bn), up 28 per cent over last year. At Intel, growth was just 8 per cent.Yet TI's turnround did not take place over a couple of quarters or even a couple of years. The renaissance began in 1996 with the appointment of Tom Engibous as chief executive, a job he held until May.The Engibous era began in tragic fashion with the sudden death of Jerry Junkins, a well-liked TI insider who had held the top job since 1985. Mr Junkins took TI out of consumer electronics and home computers, but stayed in other non-core businesses such as defence electronics.Within the chip business, he decided that TI should remain in the D-Ram computer memory business just as other US chipmakers - including Intel - were giving up on an increasingly volatile market.The gamble did not pay off. It was left to Mr Engibous, former head of the semiconductor business and now elevated to the top job, to pull the plug. From 1996 to 1998, he sold the D-Ram and defence electronics businesses, unwound an elaborate tangle of joint ventures and cut costs. What remained was a smaller semiconductor business selling chips mainly to consumer electronics and telecoms companies.To many lay people, silicon chips are synonymous with microprocessors, the number-crunching ""brains"" of computers. But microprocessors are in fact just one slice of a much bigger market for chips that store data (memory), amplify signals (op-amps), turn analogue inputs into digital outputs and vice-versa (analogue), process streams of digital data (DSP) and much more.Mr Engibous and Mr Templeton, promoted at the age of 37 to run the semiconductor side, identified digital signal processing and analogue as TI's main strengths in terms of engineering skill, market position and growth.""The potential for DSP and analogue was incredibly obvious to us,"" recalls Mr Templeton. ""This does not mean that TI wins. But it does mean that TI is now in the right markets.""It took a few years for investors to catch on. Veteran TI watchers had heard it all before. In the 1970s, consumer electronics was heralded as the engine of growth. When that didn't happen, the mantle passed to home computers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s came Mr Junkins' big play in D-Ram. Why should this time be any different?The simple answer is that TI has a stronger competitive position in DSP and analogue chips than ever it had in D-Ram or consumer electronics. In terms of market share, economies of scale and customer relationships, it is the market leader.TI should generate about $900m of revenues this year from sales of digital light processing (DLP) chips used in a new generation of big-screen televisions. The technology - which uses up to 1m tilting, microscopic mirrors on the surface of a chip to create a moving image - emerged from the corporate lab in 1987. Since the first DLP-based TVs were launched two years ago, it has taken more than 10 per cent of the US market for TVs of 40 inches or more.Another rapidly-growing business is high performance analogue, which makes specialised chips used by electronic engineers in everything from hi-fi amplifiers to electronic test equipment.This is an arcane business. TI's HPA catalogue includes 15,000 components and the business has no fewer than 30,000 customers - most of them buying in small quantities. ""This is a business where you've got to get excited about a $27,000 order. A customer that orders $1m a year from us would be exceptionally large,"" says Gregg Lowe, senior vice-president for the division.Arcane and complex, yes. But also high growth. The HPA business grew by 25 per cent last year and should deliver revenues of about $1bn in 2004. This is impressive stuff - especially coming from a company whose core business requires staying on the right side of mega-customers such as Nokia, which last year purchased $1.4bn of chips from TI.So what is the secret behind this late flowering of innovation and entrepreneurship? Decentralisation, says Mr Templeton.In contrast to the old plan-driven approach, these days only tax, manufacturing and some aspects of marketing are handled centrally. Operating groups are free to make their own choices about technologies and products: ""DSP and analogue have a lot of growth potential. At the corporate level we just have to get resources to the line guys and get out of their way.""As every practising manager knows, however, this is more easily said than done.In 1980, the year Mr Templeton joined TI, Peter Drucker published Managing In Turbulent Times. The great sage of management warned the quickening pace of change would put a new premium on innovation: ""[Innovation] means, first, the systematic sloughing off of yesterday. It means, next, the systematic search for opportunities . . . It means a willingness to organise for entrepreneurship, to aim at creating new businesses rather than new products or modifications of old products. It means, finally, the willingness to set up the innovative venture separately, outside the existing managerial structure.""More than two decades on, Texas Instruments shows what can be achieved when the theory is put into practice. If only the message had got through earlier.REBIRTH OF A FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT CORPORATE MACHINEBack in the era of Speak’n Spell, Texas Instrument’s reputation in management circles was second to none. With its matrices and strategic planning processes, its carefully balanced portfolio of “rising stars” and “cash cows”, TI was the very model of a diversified US corporation.The downside was a slowness to respond to new opportunities or threats. Management was bureaucratic. Priorities were set according to the requirements of TI, not the needs of customers.Thus, when TI launched its first home computer in 1979, the model TI99/4 was priced at $1,150, a hefty premium to competing products. Dealers bemoaned the company’s unwillingness to back a decent product with attractive pricing and a strong promotional campaign.TI managers of the time recognised the shortcoming. Marketers were recruited from outside to shake things up. Advertising budgets were raised. Fred Bucy, then company president, used the 1982 annual shareholders’ meeting to concede that TI had become too unwieldy and out of touch.Only recently, after successful bets on specialised microchips - the digital light processors behind a new type of large-screen television and analogue chips, which control technical engineering equipment - has the company turned the corner. The secret, says Rich Templeton, TI chief executive, is decentralisation: giving engineering units the freedom to pursue innovation."
377;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
378;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-22T21:45:40Z;Miserable week for Wall Street bulls;;The second week of the earnings season proved miserable for Wall Street bulls as stocks finished broadly lower in trading that looked like lengthy and painful surgery performed without anaesthetic.By Friday’s close the Dow Jones Industrial Average established a new low for the year as it finished 1.1 per cent lower at 9,757.81. The broader S&P500 index gave up 1 per cent to 1,1095.74. The Nasdaq Composite index eased 2 per cent yesterday to 1,915.14.For the week, the Dow industrials were 1.8 per cent lower while the S&P 500 lost 1.1 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent up for the five-session strectch.Quarterly results dominated the news agenda but to a lesser extent than in previous earnings seasons. As leading names gave a mixed-to-bad picture of profitability and outlook for the future, several other factors provided a vexing background that kept stocks confined in a narrow trading range for much of the time, one they only broke to go lower.Heading a litany of worries was the latest effort by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general, to root out alleged corporate malfeasance. Mr Spitzer a week ago announced a broad probe into the insurance industry’s practices. What began as a lawsuit against leading insurance brokers widened to cover life and health insurance companies as well. As market participants speculated on where Mr Spitzer’s inquiry would reach next, the group of companies targeted came to be known as the Spitzer stocks.By the close on Friday, Marsh & McLennan shares were 72.2 per cent lower since news of the inquiry broke last week. Among the health insurers, Aetna was 17.8 per cent off for the same time period, UnitedHealthcare had lost 3.1 per cent and Cigna gave up 17 per cent.The insurers’ plight came as crude oil prices staged yet another charge upwards after a brief spell of profit-taking as worries mounted over heating oil supplies this winter. Several leading companies reporting results cited rising prices for both oil and other raw materials as a reason for profit declines and tepid guidance going forward.Whirlpool, the home appliance maker, said steel prices undermined its efforts to meet analyst estimates and led it to cut earnings guidance for the year. In the same sector, Maytag warned of the effects of rising costs on its third-quarter earnings but its shares fared better, up 3.6 per cent on Thursday as investors appeared to focus on the success of its turnround efforts.Visteon, the auto parts maker, also cited rising steel prices and customers’ output cuts as it announced a wider loss than expected on Wednesday, sending shares 2.2 per cent lower on Thursday.Some technology stocks caused cheers while others caused jeers.IBM saw its shares add 4 per cent on Tuesday after it gave an upbeat outlook as its revenues grew 9 per cent. Texas Instruments beat analyst estimates as it announced results after the Monday close and saw shares add 6.9 per cent in the subsequent session. Ebay reported a 52 per cent rise in earnings thanks to its international businesses. The news sent shares 6.9 per cent higher on Thursday.However, after the Thursday close Microsoft poured some cold water over bullish hopes for tech as it gave a cautious outlook, sending shares 2.1 per cent lower on Friday.Amazon.com, the internet’s largest retailer, also saw its shares decline, by 10.5 per cent on Friday, after its tepid guidance overshadowed sharp earnings growth.As the earnings season continues, the run-up to the presidential elections appears to be doing nothing to bring investors into the market. As polls show the candidates locked in a dead heat, analysts are saying the stock market - a forward-pricing instrument - had nothing to price and was therefore biding its time.From a technical standpoint, some analysts noted a couple of important levels were being tested. The Dow ended the week-long flirtation with a new low for the year by establishing it yesterday, breaching below 9,800 while the S&P500 broke below 1,100 on Friday and the Nasdaq Composite closed below its 200 day moving average.Several analysts have said that a breach of these benchmarks in either direction was likely to lead to acceleration of the move in subsequent sessions.Given that all three gauges have moved to the downside of their respective technical levels, chart-reading market observers expect an acceleration of the sell-off next week. While many market watchers have expressed the view that markets stand to rally once the presidential elections are over, others doubt that will be the case given concerns about oil, the economy and geopolitics.Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, said the likeliest outcome of the elections is a gridlock betwen the White House and Congress, which has historically been a bullish factor for the stock market.Bullish analysts hope that oil prices will reverse their rise but others have pointed out that such a move could be triggered by a slowdown in economic growth, which would not be a positive for stocks.
379;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-19T21:22:15Z;Global Overview: Falling oil gives equities a fillip;;"Falling oil prices and upbeat earnings statements from two US technology heavyweights gave Asian and European bourses a much-needed boost yesterday.But after a strong opening that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average back through the 10,000 mark, selling pressure set in amid fears that leading US health insurers would be embroiled in an investigation into the industry. By the close, the Dow was down 0.6 per cent at 9,897.62, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was 0.7 per cent lower at 1,922.90.Overnight falls in oil prices and better-than-expected results from IBM and Texas Instruments meant Wall Street's positive mood at the close of play on Monday spilled over into Asia and Europe. The Tokyo market ended a seven-day losing streak, with the Nikkei 225 Average rising 0.9 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index edged back through 1,000, closing 1 per cent higher at 1001.7.Nymex crude futures, which reached a new record of $55.33 in Asian trading on Monday, fell for a second consecutive day as traders took a more pessimistic view about the outlook for global growth next year. Nymex November crude futures settled down 38 cents at $53.29 per barrel, while Brent oil was down 59 cents at $48.32.The equity markets' enthusiastic reaction to falling oil prices left at least one observer bemused. Jim Wood-Smith, head of strategy research at Gerrard in London, said: ""It remains a slight puzzle that each fractional down day in the oil markets is purported to lie behind equity rallies, seemingly no matter how much the oil price had risen in the preceding days. This may be indicative that investors are more willing to buy the dips than sell into strength.""If this is one sign of returning investor confidence, then so too was the latest survey by State Street Global Markets. Its global confidence index climbed 0.9 per cent in October from a revised 84.7 in September. But the index remains close to its lows for the year and the October increase - only the second rise this year - marks only a small recovery after the 24-point fall from 109.0 last December.Michael Metcalfe, senior strategist at State Street Global, said: ""The fact that investor confidence fell for the first seven months of the year and has now stabilised suggests that professional investors reduced their allocations to risky assets in anticipation of slower growth and higher oil prices. As a consequence their confidence is now less vulnerable than either consumers or business to the latest wobble in growth.""The fall in oil prices boosted the yen, which jumped 0.9 per cent to a three-month high of Y108.39 against the dollar. As Japan has no oil production of its own, it is particularly sensitive to changes in crude prices.Gold rose $3.85 to $419.35 an ounce, spurred by a weaker dollar. The US currency fell despite an uptick in core US inflation that suggests the Fed will continue to raise interest rates."
380;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-19T21:01:06Z;Insurance probe spooks Wall Street;;"Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, gave markets an early taste of Halloween with his broadening probe of the insurance industry.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 9,897.55 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 1 per cent to 1,103.23. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite lost 0 .7 per cent to 1,922.90.On the anniversary of the 1987 market crash, fears that worse was yet to come in Mr Spitzer's investigation of insurance brokers and health insurance groups chilled any early optimism from a falling crude oil price and encouraging results from several leading companies.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We're seeing the Spitzer effect on the insurance stocks, where the market is throwing the baby out with the bath water . Then there is the election …we don't like it being so close with two weeks to go, we're a forward pricing mechanism and we don't know what to price now.""He added that the sell-off was likely to be exaggerated and a rebound likely once markets got a clearer picture of the effects of Mr Spitzer's latest campaign against alleged corporat e malfeasance.Health insurance shares saw broad selling after one company confirmed it had received a subpoena from Mr Spitzer's office. The insurer in question, Cigna, saw shares trim 10.3 per cen t off their value to $59.73 as UnitedHealthcare lost 9.3 per cent to $66.50 while Aetna fell 11.8 per cent to $86.17.The insurance groups initially cited by Mr Spitzer continued to suffer as Marsh & McLennan was 5.8 per cent off at $24.10 while ACE lost 6.4 per cent to $33.10.The ""Spitzer effect"" trumped comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said that ""household finances appear to be in reasonably good shape"". Some bearish market wa tchers have long warned about excessive household indebtedness in the US and a possible retrenchment in consumer demand.Among the key stocks battling the downward pressures on the the market yesterday was IBM, the world's biggest computer company, which saw shares rise 4 per cent to $89.37 after it reported after the market close on Monday. Flat net profit was eclipsed by the company's optimistic outlook, as net revenue rose 9 per cent in the quarter. Excluding costs associated with a legal settlement, net profit was b etter than forecasts.Texas Instruments,which also reported after the close on Monday, beat expectations with its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $22.55.EMC shares rose 1.1 per cent to $12.28 after the data storage company reported an in-line 37 per cent rise in third-quarter profit as it gained market share.Ford Motor announced higher-than-expected quarterly profit as gains for the company's finance division offset losses at its auto unit. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook and the shares edged off 3.4 per cent to $12.93.Ford's news came after rival General Motors announced sharp cost-cutting decisions at its European operations in a bid to stem losses there. GM shares were 2.3 per cent lower at $38 on the Dow.Shares in McDonald's, another component of the blue-chip stock gauge, eased 0.7 per cent to $29 after the restaurant operator reported a 42 per cent rise in profits.Leapfrog Enterprises cut its quarterly earnings outlook and sent shares 34.1 per cent lower to $11.99 as the educational toy company cited a challenging industry environment.Boston Scientific shares lost 5.6 per cent to $35.71 as investors were disappointed by its guidance even after earnings grew amid strong demand for the group's medical devices.Economic news gave a mixed reading of the recovery in the US. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent last month, taking the annualised inflation rate in September to 2.5 per cent, but a sharp jump in lodging costs pushed core inflation up a surprise 0.3 per cent.Stephen Gallagher, the chief US economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said the data were unlikely to cause the Fed to interrupt its course of steady increases in interest rates. He added that employment trends would be more important in that process."
381;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-19T16:51:39Z;Bourses rally as insurers and IT stocks gain;;A sequence of three consecutive losing sessions on European markets was brought to a halt on Tuesday, helped by a sprinkling of bullish news from leading continental stocks.It meant the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was able to recapture the 1,000 level it lost last week and it ended the session 1 per cent higher at 1,001.78.It was not all plain sailing, however. The decline in oil and metal prices left the relevant sectors with losses, while some UK insurers reeled in the wake of the surprise £1bn rights issue from Prudential.Non-UK insurers enjoyed a much better day, however, as some of the turbulence triggered by the campaign launched by New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer against Marsh & McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, looked to have blown itself out for the time being.Swiss Re shares climbed 1.6 per cent to SFr73.50, Allianz 1.4 per cent to €81.35 and Munich Re 1.4 per cent to €73.76.Shares in OMV, one of the most popular of the oil stocks during the recent surge in oil prices, were given a rough ride, slipping 2.2 per cent to €200.50. This was after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the stock with an “underweight” tag and a €195 price target.The broker said: “We think the Petrom deal will determine OMV's relative performance in the near-term and would switch into OMV's overweight-rated peers Repsol, MOL and Norsk Hydro.Repsol shares edged up 0.1 per cent to €17.49 and Hungary's MOL climbed 2.5 per cent to Ft10870.IT and related stocks attracted strong support after bullish statements from IBM and Texas Instruments on Monday evening. Shares in STMicroelectronics, Europe's leading microchip maker, rose 2.2 per cent to €14.11 ahead of this morning's third quarter results which are expected to produce a 53 per cent increase in underlying operating profits. UBS lowered its price target for STMicro to €11 from €12.ABN Amro was the driving force behind the good performances of a handful of software and computer services stocks. Initiating coverage of the sector ABN said: “After three difficult years we believe the sector is cheaper. We suggest careful stock picking in flexibility, cost-cutting and turnaround stories, such as SAP, Atos Origin and Cap Gemini.Atos shares added 3.3 per cent at €46.07, SAP 3.2 per cent at €132 and Cap Gemini 2 per cent at €18.53.Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, was among the top performers in the FTSE Eurofirst 300, its shares advancing 4.1 per cent to €29.42, reflecting better-than-expected third quarter figures and a bullish outlook for the rest of the year.Morgan Stanley focused its attention on the central eastern European banks which it said “are simple stories with high upside potential, being geared to rising interest rates through widening margins and (they) offer potential capital restructuring without the distraction of poor Austrian fundamentals”. It described Komercni, the Czech Republic bank, as a “textbook buy and our top pick”. Hungary's OTP was the US bank's second pick. Komercni shares jumped 5.5 per cent to Kcs3133 and those of OTP 2.5 per cent to Ft4530.
382;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;ARM plays a strong hand in third-quarter;;ARM Holdings, the UK chip designer, demonstrated that its core business was strong in its third quarter results, with no signs of a slowdown in sales to top clients including Texas Instruments.The group predicted strong revenue growth for the year ahead, after third quarter revenues of ?39.3m released on Tuesday were slightly ahead of consensus figures of about ?39m.ARM said it expected full year revenue growth of around 30 per cent, in US dollar terms, despite a slowdown in growth rates for the semi-conductor industry in general.?There are signs that overall industry growth in the second half of the year will be at more modest levels,? ARM said in a statement.This is consistent with recent comments from other industry players, as well as its own previous comments.ARM Holdings charges chip-makers for use of its designs, collecting one-off royalties on top of its initial manufacturing licence fees for chips used in products such as mobile phones and digital cameras.Industry analysts have been watching for signs of inventory build-up at ARM?s major clients, as an indicator of future impact on ARM, and were assuaged by better news from Texas Instruments in its third quarter results released overnight.Texas - as the dominant maker of chips for mobile phones - is the largest contributor of royalty revenue to ARM Holdings. It particularly singled out its wireless business for strong performance, in its overnight results, with the weakness showing in the analog and standard products where ARM has no exposure.?Texas Instrument results are undoubtedly good for ARM?, said broker Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, noting that ARM recognized royalty revenues one quarter after customers such as Texas Instruments report.?It now seems more likely that in this semi-downturn ARM could still see flat royalty growth in the worst case,? the broker said.The pre-tax profit of $13.3m for the third quarter was also ahead of the consensus figure of about ?11m.Industry analysts also pointed to the inclusion of one-off catch-up payments, relating to shipments from previous financial periods, as well as lower operating costs, for the discrepancy from expectations.ARM also gave a positive progress update for the proposed $913m acquisition of Artisan, with shareholder meetings scheduled to approve the merger that is expected to be completed either by the end of 2004 or early in 2005.Shares in ARM rose 2.65 per cent by midday in London trading, to 87.5p.
383;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-19T07:17:18Z;Tokyo shares buoyed by US tech sector;;Tokyo stocks rose for the first time in eight sessions on Tuesday as better-than-expected earnings in the US technology sector provided respite from oil worries.The Nikkei 225 closed up 0.9 per cent at 11,064.86 while the Topix index had risen 0.7 per cent to 1,108.65.The gains ended a run of losses caused by concerns that high oil prices threatened Japanese and global economic growth.Trepidation ahead of key earnings reports in the US had also put downward pressure on the market, but decent results from IBM and Texas Instruments overnight provided some relief and helped Wall Street to marginal gains.Market watchers, however, said trading remained thin in Tokyo and investors were cautious on the short-term outlook.Fujitsu, the electronics conglomerate, rose 4.1 per cent to Y641 after the group cut its net loss forecast for the half year to September by two-thirds on Monday.Sanyo Electric rose 1.7 per cent to Y362 after it announced Monday that it would team up with DaimlerChrysler to develop batteries for Mercedes-Benz hybrid cars. Sanyo also aims to lift its European sales to Y200bn in 2006 and to Y500bn by 2010.NEC, which widened a loss forecast at the end of last week, rose 0.8 per cent to Y638 after sinking to a 15-month low on Monday.Shizuoka Bank climbed 5 per cent to Y883 after the regional lender raised its half-year profit forecast to Y25bn from Y19bn.
384;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-18T22:50:31Z;Demand for cellphones benefits TI;;Strong demand from mobile phone makers enabled Texas Instruments, the world's largest communications chips producer, to report a higher than expected third quarter profit, even as distributors and customers trimmed inventories of analogue chips.Earnings in the third quarter ended September 30 were $563m, or 32 cents per share, compared with a profit of $447m, or 25 cents per share, during the same period last year. Revenue rose to $3.25bn from $2.53bn.The company said last month it expected earnings of 27-29 cents per share on revenue between $3.1bn-$3.24bn. Analysts were expecting TI to post a profit of 27 cents per share on sales of $3.17bn, according to Thomson First Call.TI last month loweredits revenue expectations as customers trimmed orders for products that use semiconductors. The company slowed down production at its semiconductor plants in the most recent quarter to keep inventories from rising too quickly.TI supplies chips for high-end mobile phones that can access the internet, take photographs and play music. Nokia, the world's largest handset maker and TI's biggest customer, has said global cellular phone sales would increase 20 per cent this year.The company also said demand for digital light processing, or DLP, chips soared on demand for big-screen TVs.?In the nascent market for digital televisions, our DLP technology is now outselling plasma in the North American market for big-screen TVs,? said Rich Templeton, the group's chief executive.Strong growth in wireless and DLP chips offset declines in other areas, primarily in standard products such as analogue chips, which convert analogue signals to digital signals and vice versa. The company warned that distributors continued to hold greater-than-normal levels of inventories of standard analog products. As a result of inventory reductions, TI said it expected to report fourth quarter revenue of $2.96bn-$3.2bn, slightly below analysts' expectations. The company also forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 24-28 cents per share.Analysts were expecting TI to report a fourth quarter profit of 26 cents per share on sales of $3.21bn.Shares in the company were up $1.12 cents, or 5.3 per cent, to $22.21 in after-hours trading following the group's results on Monday.
385;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-10-05T17:50:07Z;Intel renews effort to enter mobile phones;;Intel, the world's largest semiconductor producer, renewed its efforts to gain a foothold in the mobile phone industry on Tuesday, announcing a co-operation deal with Nokia, the Finnish handset supplier, and Symbian, a UK software group.The three will work together in the development of more advanced handsets known as ?smartphones?, which offer many of the functions available on handheld computers.Intel is keen to expand its presence in the mobile segment at a time when growth is slowing and competition is tough in the areas it has traditionally dominated such as personal computers.Its link with Nokia and Symbian will increase pressure on the big suppliers to the mobile industry such as Texas Instruments, Philips and STMicroelectronics.Under the agreement, Intel will develop chips that can be used with Nokia's Series 60 platform, which provides smartphones with a user interface. Although developed by the Finnish group, Series 60 is licensed out to other manufacturers such as Samsung, Sendo, Panasonic and Siemens.In a separate part of the co-operation, Intel will invest in the co-development with Symbian of a standard reference design for chips and software for third-generation mobile phones. Symbian OS is the main operating system used by smartphones.The aim is to enable handset producers to buy an off-the-peg smartphone platform, speeding up the time it takes for new models to reach market. ?It's like developing a car with the engine and the chassis ready. The phone manufacturers can then shape the body, paint it and fix the interior as they like,? one analyst said.David Levin, Symbian chief executive, said: ?We believe that, by 2008 or 2009, the addressable market the number of phones capable of running Symbian could reach as many as 200m.?
386;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-09-20T11:27:17Z;Samsung warns on sales growth;;Samsung Electronics, the world's second-largest chipmaker, expects global chip sales next year to grow at half of this year's pace, as increased supply hits prices.The gloomy projection is in line with forecasts by Samsung's rivals Intel and Texas Instruments. The global chipmakers both lowered their sales forecasts this month, as growth in demand for chips used in personal computers slows. ?Semiconductor [sales] growth will slow down next year, and memory chip prices will fall sharply, because of increased supply,? Hwang Chang-gyu, head of Samsung's semiconductor business, said. ?But we are prepared for steady growth thanks to specialised products.?He forecast chip sales to grow 20 per cent this year to $220bn and rise less than 10 per cent to $240bn-$250bn next year.Sales of memory chips will probably rise to $43bn this year and to $45bn next year, Samsung said.?The age for PC-driven growth has passed,? Mr Hwang said. ?Mobile and digital consumer applications are the new driving forces of the IT era.?Computer shipments will increase 13 per cent this year to 191m units while sales of mobile phones will grow 20 per cent to 625m units, according to market researcher Isuppli.Analysts said Samsung would be less affected than rivals by slowing growth momentum in semiconductor business as it had substantially reduced its dependence on PC demand.Samsung has reduced the proportion of its memory chips used for PCs to 44 per cent of overall output while increasing that for digital consumer appliances and mobile phones to 40 per cent and 16 per cent. Mr Hwang declined to comment on the US price-fixing investigation into D-Ram makers, saying only that the company was fully co-operating with the two-year probe. Germany's Infineon Technologies recently agreed to plead guilty to charges and pay a $160m fine.Analysts said Infineon's admission of the charges was a negative development for Korean chipmakers. Chin Young-hoon, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said: ?It is unfavourable to Samsung and Hynix Semiconductor. But even if Samsung is fined, that would not have a big impact on the company, because it has huge cash reserves.?
387;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-09-10T21:00:49Z;Earnings fears loom as Wall St rally slows;;"Wall Street notched its fifth consecutive weekly gain on Friday, but the recent rally seemed in danger of losing steam as investor worries about a coming earnings slowdown increased.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,313.07, for a 0.5 per cent gain on the week. The S&P 500 added 0.5 per cent to 1,123.92, for a gain of 0.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent higher at 1,894.31, for a 2.7 per cent gain on the week.Trading volumes have remained relatively tepid throughout the week's four sessions.Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck, said: ""Investors are confronted with a decent economy but not a runaway economy and naggingly high oil prices …with that kind of backdrop it's not surprising we've gone from a summer lull into a fall lull.""Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said investors' sunny mood became increasingly difficult to maintain in the face of Corporate America's warnings of soft demand.He noted that the pre- announcement season, when companies warn investors of disappointments and surprises in earnings, traditionally begins in the third or fourth week of the final month of a quarter. This week, the first of the final month of the quarter, marked an early start to the ""confessional season"". ""That tells me we've probably got a lot more coming,"" Mr Boockvar said.Technology stocks climbed in spite of warnings, because markets had anticipated the bad news - most notably from chipmakers, who in recent weeks signalled softer-than-expected demand. Plus, the sector has already been badly beaten. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has shed about 20 per cent since July.But lower forecasts from other sectors, including foods, auto parts makers and materials producers, heightened investors' worries about a slowdown.Chipmakers admitting to slumping demand included Texas Instruments,which gained 0.6 per cent to $18.83 on Wednesday in spite of lowering its quarterly revenue outlook. National Semiconductor,which also reduced first fiscal quarter revenue expectations, still saw shares gain 12.3 per cent to $13.48 on Thursday, as investors focused on its robust quarterly profits.On Thursday night, chipmaker warnings emerged. Culprits included Transmeta,which lowered revenue guidance and saw shares drop 9.5 per cent to $1.34 by Friday's close. Atmel and Vishay Intertechnology reduced sales targets for the third quarter, blaming soft demand and slipping prices. Atmel shares slid 1.1 per cent to $3.71, while Vishay added 8.6 per cent to $13.70.Elsewhere, Alcoa,the world's biggest aluminium producer, dragged on the Dow, falling 7.6 per cent to $30.75 by the close on Friday after it said third-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street's expectations, blaming soft demand.Autoparts makers added to the gloom. American Axle shares slipped 2.8 per cent to $33.37 on Thursday after the General Motors supplier said earnings would be below forecasts. Visteon on Friday shed 11.1 per cent to $8, after the company warned that second-half results would be sharply below estimates.Bad news also emerged in the food sector, as Dean Foods, the largest dairy group in the US, warned on Wednesday that its third-quarter and full-year profits would drop sharply. Like ailing poultry producers last month, the company blamed rising fuel and raw materials prices. Shares fell 18.1 per cent to $30.40 on the day.However, a ray of light peered out from the technology sector on Friday, as Oracle appeared finally to have won its hostile takeover bid for rival software outfit PeopleSoft. On Thursday a court ruled against a Department of Justice attempt to block the deal. By the close, PeopleSoft shares had gained 10.3 per cent to $19.79."
388;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-09-09T20:43:33Z;Wall Street drifts lower in hesitant market;;"Wall Street blue chips drifted lower on Thursday while the broader market managed modest gains as a cocktail of concerns, including the explosion outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, countered the optimism prompted by Nokia's upbeat forecast.Trading volumes recovered somewhat, reaching 1.4bn shares at the New York Stock Exchange. However, some analysts we unconvinced and said there remained many investors unwilling to participate in the market.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 10,289.10. The broader S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,118.38, while the Nasdaq Composite index added 1 per cent to 1,869.65.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said increased buying of put options on equity indices such as the S&P 500 was ""an indicator of some fear …when people are buying puts they're looking to protect their broad equity exposure, [but] they're comfortable with what they own.""Weekly data on jobless benefit applications, which fell at the fastest rate since December 2001, helped vindicate some of Wall Street's optimism on the economy. However, data on oil inventories pointed to price pressures on crude futures, which rose.Mr Caffrey said the economic data supported the view that ""the backdrop is good, but some pressures remain within the system"".In a listless broader market, some stocks responded to company and sector-specific news.National Semiconductor reported strong profits but warned of a tough time ahead amid soft demand for its chips a week after Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company, disappointed investors with its mid-quarter update. National Semi shares jumped 12.3 per cent higher at $13.48 . They have fallen about 43 per cent since June.The NYSE-listed shares of Nokia rose 8.3 per cent to $13.77 after the Finnish mobile phonemaker increased its quarterly earnings guidance, citing strong demand.The news helped the shares of Texas Instruments, which makes chips for mobile handsets, rebound 10.3 per cent to $20.77, despite a trimmed estimate announced the previous day.Corning shares added 9.3 per cent to $11.09 after the fibre-optics group gave a mixed review of its business, raising sales forecasts for fibre-optic cables but warning of slowing demand for liquid-crystal displays.Elsewhere among technology shares, Apple Computer lost 1.8 per cent to $35.70 after Andrew Neff, analyst at Bear Stearns, cut his rating on the stock due to valuation concerns.Consumer-related stocks weighed on the Dow even though Procter & Gamble reiterated its quarterly profits forecasts. Shares in P&G gave up 1.1 per cent to $56.09 while Johnson & Johnson was 1.3 per cent lower at $57.51.The two declines in high-priced shares counted for much of the retreat in the price-weighted average.General Motors shares gave up 0.9 per cent to $42.82 as investors were reminded of its difficulties by a warning from American Axle, which supplies some of GM's parts, that earnings would be below prior estimates. American Axle shares were 2.8 per cent lower at $33.37.Among restaurant stocks, Yum Brands saw shares add 3.3 per cent to $40.61 after the operator of the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell fast food restaurants reiterated its quarterly earnings estimate.In the same sector CBRL Group shares added 8 per cent to $35.08 after the operator of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurants reported lower quarterly earnings as a result of settling legal allegations of discrimination and labour law violations.Steel stocks made a solid showing on the top gainers list at the NYSE, with Nucor up 7.4 per cent to $88.36 after it raised its quarterly profits forecast by 44 per cent, saying rising steel prices helped its margins.Also higher were Oregon Steel, up 13.1 per cent to $17; International Steel Group, which added 5.7 per cent to $33.57; AK Steel Holding, up 8.6 per cent to $6.79; and US Steel, which gained 5.2 per cent to $39.96."
389;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-09-08T21:20:53Z;Texas Instruments cuts revenue forecast;;Texas Instruments on Wednesday cut its revenue forecast for the current quarter, the second big chipmaker to do so since last week.But the US company, the largest manufacturer of semiconductors for mobile phones, did not pare back its profit forecast for the third quarter.TI blamed the revenue shortfall on customers moving ?quickly to reduce inventory levels to more closely match their own end-equipment growth rates?. The chipmaker said its customers' shipments were still ?healthy? and its revised forecast reflected ?changes in customers' expectations for end-demand growth?.Analysts had cautioned that TI might be hit by weaker sales to distributors and wireless handset makers this quarter and they expected the chipmaker to lower estimates on Wednesday during its scheduled mid-quarter update for the period ending Sept 30.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, said last week that weaker than expected demand for personal computers and consumer electronics products would hit its revenues and profit margins in the current quarter.The chipmakers' revisions have come after a difficult summer for technology stocks as investors worried that rising inventories in the sector could be a sign of slowing demand.TI said it expected to report total revenue of $3.1bn-$3.24bn, compared with the prior forecast of $3.2bn-$3.44bn provided on July 20. Earnings per share were seen at 27-29 cents, compared with the previous range of 26-29 cents.Analysts were, on average, forecasting sales of $3.31bn and earnings of 27 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.The group's earnings estimate reflected ?reduced factory loadings? and a lower expected accrual for profit sharing.The group also said its effective annual tax rate had been reduced from 29 per cent to 26 per cent, primarily due to export sales. Including catch-up adjustments, the third-quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be about 21 per cent.The company said semiconductor revenue would be $2.67bn-$2.79bn compared with prior guidance of $2.78bn-$2.98bn. The group also narrowed but did not reduce the revenue forecast ranges for its sensors and controls unit and its educational products segment.TI said it pulled back production at its factories and partners' foundries in response to the inventory adjustments. But it expected its own mobile phone chip inventory to increase in the third quarter in anticipation of holiday-inspired fourth-quarter shipments.TI said its $1.3bn budget for capital expenditures remained unchanged.Shares in TI were up almost 2 per cent to $19.14 in after hours trading on Wednesday.
390;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-09-08T20:41:21Z;Wall Street traders find little reason to act;;Wall Street drifted lower on Wednesday as some companies gave profit warnings and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, gave a neutral assessment of the economy to Congress, failing to inspire market participants to more decisive trades.Mr Greenspan continued to attribute the slowing growth of the economy to higher energy costs while pointing out that expansion was still occurring, a position some economists took issue with.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,313.36, while the broader S&P 500 index edged off 0.5 per cent to 1,116.27. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 percent lower at 1,850.27.The action failed to offer relief from the late-August lull, which some senior traders said was even duller than they had seen in previous years.Arthur Cashin at UBS noted the lockstep of the indices in the previous session, as well as early yesterday. He said that such action generally owed more to so-called momentum surfing, or algorithmic trading decisions made automatically through computerised models, as opposed to longer-term investment decisions from money managers.Mr Greenspan told the Budget committee that the world's largest economy was growing “reasonably well”, thus avoiding possible accusations of partisanship from either Republicans or Democrats.Market participants are also pondering what Mr Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve might do to benchmark interest rates this month, with the consensus view being that the economic situation is far from clear.Market participants did not get much clarity on that topic from the Fed's Beige Book, the periodical survey of grassroots conditions in the economy, gathered from its regional offices. The report said economic growth slowed somewhat in the summer months due to lower consumer spending.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, disagreed with some of Mr Greenspan's relative optimism and concluded that the Fed would raise interest rates this month.On the corporate front, the shares of Texas Instruments added 0.6 per cent to $18.83 as the mobile phone chipmaker lowered its quarterly revenue outlook a week after Intel announced similar moves.Elsewhere in technology, Oracle shares eased 2.2 per cent to $9.86 following a downgrade by analysts at Piper Jaffray. Shares in PeopleSoft, with which Oracle is embroiled in a hostile bid battle, were off 1.3 cent to $17.49.In deal-making news, the shares of Tellabs rose 4.9 per cent to $9.57 after the telecommunications equipment provider revised the terms of its buyout offer for Advanced Fibre Communications, whose shares fell 7.6 per cent to $15.90. Acquisitions are generally seen as dilutive for the shareholder value of the acquiring company and accretive for the target group.Coca-Cola lost 4.8 per cent to $43.45, weighing on the Dow, after the largest bottller of its products cut its earnings forecast.Also lower was Avon Products, the cosmetics company, which warned of lower operating profits by as much as 10 per cent. Shares lost 6.1 per cent to $42.86.Dean Foods, the largest dairy group in the US, gave another grim outlook to investors, a day after saying it was facing sharply lower profits due to a variety of factors. Shares tumbled 18.1 per cent to $30.40.Among pharmaceuticals, the shares of Mylan Laboratories added 0.6 per cent to $18.18 after news that Carl Icahn, a well-known investor, had acquired a 6.8 per cent stake in the company and opposed its acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals. Shares in King fell 5.3 per cent to $12.32.In airline stocks the shares of JetBlue added 0.3 per cent to $23.14 after the low-cost carrier, and one of few stockmarket darlings in the sector, said the aftermath of Hurricane Frances would hurt its earnings by affecting demand for its flights to Florida.Among insurers, the shares of Allstate eased 0.8 per cent to $47.54 while St Paul Travelers was off 0.4 per cent at $34.04. Jay Cohen, analyst at Merrill Lynch, cut earnings estimates for the two insurers by 2.7 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively, noting worse than expected effects on the companies' earnings from Hurricane Charley.

The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,858.56.The continuing fall in oil prices lifted the market's mood but led the S&P 500 energy sector to one of the session's weakest performances, flat on the day. It was one of just three sectors not firmly in the black.Market participants said a cocktail of other factors helped the day's performance, including relief that the Republican National Convention finished without a terrorist attack, as well as the return of many money managers who had been on holiday in late August.James Dlugosch, editor of the Rational Investor Newsletter, noted that cash positions had been growing through the sleepy summer season.Additionally, after a week of disappointing corporate news, investors were primed to welcome any profits surprises or climbing earnings forecasts.Hovnanian Enterprises rose 9.3 per cent to $38.50 after the luxury homebuilder topped Wall Street's third quarter profits expectations and boosted its forecast for the full fiscal year.Seagate Technology, which makes computer hard drives, rose 3.8 per cent to $12.32 after forecasting quarterly sales and earnings above Wall Street estimates amid stronger demand.Fleetwood Enterprises, maker of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, added 12.4 per cent at $15 after strong sales drove it to a fiscal first quarter profit of $6.7m, double Wall Street's expectations.However, the day also brought disappointment.Shares in US Airways sank 12.8 per cent to $2.05 after leaders of the airline's pilots union snubbed the company's latest contract proposal, denting the company's efforts to avoid a second bankruptcy filing.But the rest of the airline sector received a slight boost from the sliding oil price. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3 per cent to $4.48, AMR, parent of American Airlines added 0.2 per cent at $8.92, Continental Airlines gained 1 per cent to $9.67 and Southwest Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $14.45.Insurers saw a mild relief rally as damage caused by Hurricane Frances appeared to be less than was feared. The S&P 500 group added 1.2 per cent. Allstate, the insurer and largest property casualty in Florida, rose 1.9 per cent to $47.91. Other insurers with personal lines in Florida include Chubb, up 1.6 per cent to $69.65; Hartford Financial Services Group, up 1.8 per cent to $62.34; and Safeco, up 1.3 per cent to $48.41.Netflix, the mail order video rental service, leapt 7.3 per cent to $15.41 after Newsweek reported the company had struck an agreement with TiVo, the maker of television recorders, to allow Netflix subscribers to download movies over the Internet to their TiVos. TiVo shares rose 14.9 per cent to $5.08.Tech stocks enjoyed a rebound from last week's sharp losses, triggered in part by a disappointing mid-quarter update from bellwether Intel.Cisco rose 1.6 per cent to $19.05, after it was upgraded by CIBC World Markets. The analysts cited a strong growth outlook, predicting “at least” six quarters of outperformance.But not all of Wall Street was so upbeat about techs. Texas Instruments slid 2.4 per cent to $18.71 after several Wall Street analysts made negative comments ahead of its mid-quarter update today. Rival National Semiconductor dipped 5.7 per cent to $12.42.International Game Technology added 6.1 per cent to $31.89 after a positive story in Barron's over the weekend.

394;TXN;Texas Instruments;2004-08-25T23:36:03Z;Intel launches ‘tri-mode' chipset for notebook PCs;;Intel will on Thursday launch its first chipset for notebook computers that supports all three current forms of “wi-fi” wireless networking.The announcement will underscore Intel's progress in wireless technology, where it has struggled to keep pace with rivals such as Texas Instruments and Broadcom.“Intel is finally learning how to make wireless chips,” said Will Strauss, an analyst at Forward Concepts, a semiconductor research company.The world's largest semiconductor company started its campaign to break into the communications chip business in the late 1990s as a complement to its core microprocessor business.However, the initiative has been hampered by product delays and stronger than expected competition.In the first half of this year, the communications chip division posted an operating loss of $345m on revenues of $2.3bn.The new Centrino chipset will support 802.11a, b and g technology, enabling laptop computers to remain connected to the internet wherever a wi-fi connection is available.Most public wi-fi access points currently use the 802.11b standard. However, companies are starting to use faster 802.11g technology for wireless networks within corporate offices.The 802.11a standard is emerging as a popular technology for home networks because, unlike other wi-fi variants, it does not suffer interference from microwave ovens and wireless telephones.TI, Broadcom and Atheros, a small Silicon Valley company that specialises in wi-fi technology, already offer “tri-mode” chips, which support all three standards.Until now, Intel has offered only a “bi-mode” version of Centrino, supporting 802.11b and g.“Intel is playing catch-up,” said Krishna Shankar, analysts at Caris & Company, a San Francisco-based investment bank.The tri-mode Centrino chipset is unlikely to generate substantial additional revenues. However, analysts said that Intel's ability to master tri-mode technology could help it win business from mobile phone makers and manufacturers of other networked devices.
395;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Intel scraps big-screen technology launch;;Intel has scrapped the launch of an ambitious technology it once claimed would halve the cost of large-screen televisions before the end of this year.The initiative was central to the chipmaker's efforts to catch up with and eventually leapfrog rival Texas Instruments in making the core components for large-scale projection televisions.While the immediate plans have been put on ice, Intel said that it was still committed to using the technology and believed it would become important in the consumer electronics business. The screens would be competitors to LCD flat screens, the current darling of the technology sector, which is being boosted by billions of dollars of investment by US and Asian manufacturers.The aborted launch of the TV technology is the latest misstep to dent Intel's reputation for engineering prowess and has raised questions about its strategy in a number of specialised chip markets.The US chipmaker made waves in the consumer electronics sector when it trumpeted the potential of the new TV technology at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.Speaking at the time, Paul Otellini, Intel's president, predicted: “This will change large-screen television economics.”The technology, known as liquid crystal on silicon, or LCOS, involves mounting a thin layer of liquid crystal silicon on a number of transistors. The device acts like a mirror, bouncing back light directed at it and using the transistors to manipulate the reflected light into an image.David Mentley, an analyst at Stanford Resources, said the effort of combining both traditional chipmaking and optical technologies on a single device had made LCOS a difficult technology to master and had led to disappointments from a number of chip companies. Intel said that it had decided to hold back from launching the technology until it could be sure that it would produce “clear product differentiation” from rival technologies.Mr Mentley said that Texas Instruments had stolen a lead in the large-screen TV business with chips known as digital light processors. Along with a separate technology used by Sony known as polysilicon transmission displays DLPs had established a strong position in the projection TV market.That made it difficult for LCOS to break in until it could demonstrate a clear product advantage at a lower cost. For big screen televisions of 36in or larger, flat screen sets already outsell conventional cathode ray tube sets.LCD panels made by manufacturers including Sharp, Samsung and LG-Philips are also expected to fall in price as production is increased.
396;TXN;Texas Instruments;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
