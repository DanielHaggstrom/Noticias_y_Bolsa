0;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2017-04-26T21:57:28Z;Edward Lifesciences helps healthcare stocks extend run;Shares of the medical equipment maker shine after earnings, as M&A boosts the sector;Medical equipment company Edwards Lifesciences led gains in the S&P 500 on Wednesday as healthcare extended a running that has made it the third-best performing sector this year.The company, known for its work on heart treatments, rose 10.5 per cent to $109.30 by the close of trading in New York. The rally extended gains made in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the release of quarterly earnings that beat analysts estimates.Edwards Lifesciences reported earnings per share of 94 cents, above estimates of 82 cents and beating its results from the first quarter of 2016. Revenue also eclipsed forecasts of $775.8m, coming in at $821.7m, and US sales rose 39 per cent to $299m.The earnings are part of a broader surge in medical technology, with earnings from medical manufacturer Baxter also cheered, leading to a 4.5 per cent rise in the shares to $55.59.The S&P 500 healthcare sector rose 0.5 per cent on Wednesday, while the broader market retreated from near record highs following details of President Donald Trump’s tax plan, which some investors viewed as infeasible in its current form and unlikely to pass. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 per cent to 2,387.45, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 20,975.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 6,025.23.The medical technology sector has also been buoyed this week by the merger of two hospital supply power houses, with Becton Dickinson set to acquire CR Bard. It follows Cardinal Health’s announcement last week that it will acquire Medtronic’s medical supplies unit. Baxter chief executive Jose Almeida said on the company’s earnings call that it is also interested adding to the wave of deals.“A rising tide raises all boats . . . The ability to lower the overall tax rate and the impact of tax reform is something we speak to investors about regularly,” said Joanne Wuensch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “But I think the recent move is more about fundamentals and the recently announced M&A. It has revived the conversation around other potential acquisitions.”Elsewhere, US Steel continued to tumble following its disappointing earnings release late on Tuesday. The company cut its full-year forecast following a $180m quarterly loss. The company’s share price fell 26.8 per cent to $22.78, its steepest one-day decline in more than 25 years.Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected earnings per share of 31 cents on a profit of $50.8m. Pittsburgh-based US Steel said that it took a $35m adjustment “associated with the loss on the shutdown of certain tubular assets”.US Steel blamed the loss on “operating challenges” at certain facilities. Sales, meanwhile, came in at $2.7bn for the quarter, less than the $2.95bn that Wall Street analysts were looking for.
1;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2014-04-14T18:52:19Z;Rosy glow for WebMD as healthcare pays off;S&P 500 staunches losses;WebMD demonstrated that the US healthcare industry – one of the more reliable creators of jobs since the recession – remains robust, its shares initially surging 20 per cent on the company’s latest earnings guidance.Shares in the healthcare website fell back to close almost 16.5 per cent higher at $43.87, after the company said first-quarter sales would be at the high end of guidance first offered in February and profits would beat those forecasts.WebMD has forecast it will generate earnings of as much as $30.5m on sales of up to $133m in the first quarter.Chief executive David Schlanger said the update to guidance “reflects recent improvements in our sales activity compared to our experience in the early weeks of 2014”.Unique monthly users to the website rose 32 per cent from a year earlier to 174m, while page views increased to 3.5bn.WebMD generates the majority of its sales and profits from advertising and sponsorship on its site, although it also supplies content for internal sites for other companies.Elsewhere, Medtronic shares fell about 2 per cent to $58.06 after the medical device maker received an unfavourable ruling from a federal court in Delaware banning it from selling its aortic heart valve replacement system, which was earlier found to infringe a patent by rival Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards’ shares rose just over 11 per cent to end at $81.08.Shares in Aspen Insurance Holdings rallied 11.25 per cent after rejecting a $3.2bn hostile bid by rival Endurance Specialty Holdings, dubbing it “ill-conceived” with “significant execution risk” and a “strategic mismatch”.Endurance launched the hostile bid after failing to secure a deal during private negotiations. The cash and stock bid represented a 21 per cent premium to the value of Aspen’s shares at the close of trading on Friday.Amid concerns about share sales by founders and key executives of technology groups ahead of the recent slide in the Nasdaq index, shares in Twitter added just over 2 per cent to close at $40.90 after the messaging site’s co-founders said they had no sales planned.Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, and Chief Executive Richard Costolo, said in an SEC filing that they did not plan to sell the company’s shares after post-IPO restrictions are lifted in May.After its worst week since the spring of 2012, the S&P 500 staunched its losses on Monday, closing up 0.82 per cent at 1,830.61, after falling 2.7 per cent last week.The Nasdaq, subject to the fiercest selling last week as investors dumped high-growth technology shares, ended 0.57 per cent higher at 4,022.69. The index sank 3.1 per cent last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.91 per cent higher at 16,173.24.Sentiment was buoyed on Monday after first-quarter profits at Citigroup beat estimates, as the bank set aside less money for bad loans.Retail sales figures for March also brightened the mood, after they recorded the biggest monthly rise since September 2012.Despite anxieties over the valuation of parts of the market, particularly biotechnology and technology shares, others expect the S&P 500 to ultimately add to the 30 per cent gain it clocked last year.“Our long-term market views hold. Equities remain attractive, bonds look expensive,” said David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.
2;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2012-10-09T21:41:36Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-offs;;Technology stocks, including Apple, led a Wall Street sell-off, with most of the sector’s heavyweight names dragging the rest of the market lower in a volatile trading session.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 3,065.02.“We may be seeing a psychological sell-off in the broader market based on what’s been going on with Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“It’s a pattern we’ve seen before, when the company’s stock tends to sell off after a product release. The momentum on Apple has been so negative over the past week, it will be important to see how investors react going into the holiday season.”Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, dropped as much as 1.8 per cent but recovered somewhat to close 0.4 per cent lower at $635.85.The stock is now 9.4 per cent lower from its peak of $702, reached on the day its iPhone 5 was released internationally.Microsoft shares fell 1.7 per cent to $29.28 and Google lost 1.8 per cent to $744.09. In an effort to avoid an antitrust war with Brussels, the search group offered to label information from its in-house services that are included in its search results pages.Amazon shares fell 3.1 per cent to $250.96 after news reports that Walmart began testing same-day delivery from its own stores, directly challenging the world’s largest online retailer.Oracle, the software group, was also hit badly, down 1.7 per cent to $30.65.Shares in Netflix, the subscription video service, were down 10.85 per cent to $65.54 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy”.Analysts said that with the 31 per cent rally in the past two weeks, “the risks outweigh the reward heading into the third quarter”.The stock gained more than 10 per cent during the previous session after analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was undervalued.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, was another big loser, down 5.3 per cent to $7.80. The stock rebounded off its record lows recently after the company said it added 2m new subscribers during the third quarter.Intel shares fell 2.7 per cent to $21.90 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the chipmaker’s stock, saying: “Shares have tracked the direction of gross margin over the past decade. And thus far in 2012 that trend has continued.”In broader markets, US equities fell sharply ahead of results from aluminium producer Alcoa and from Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut – both seen by investors as setting the tone for the third-quarter earnings season.Most analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to have declined during the quarter as the global slowdown took its toll.The S&P 500 index fell 1 per cent to 1,441.48, retreating from its multiyear highs reached last week. Nine of 10 major sectors were in negative territory, with only energy registering modest gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 13,473.91.Alcoa shares closed 0.1 higher to $9.13 but rose 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading after the aluminium producer beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported improved productivity and the $143m net income loss was less than expected.The company also said it would pay $85m to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by Bahrain’s state-controlled aluminium company, Aluminium Bahrain, over alleged corruption.Yum! Brands closed the day 1.3 per cent lower at $66.04. But its shares rallied 3 per cent in after-hours trading as the company’s earnings per share beat estimates.The restaurant chain, with extensive operations in China and India, saw margins improve in the third quarter, although revenue of $3.57bn missed estimates.Workday, a business software company, raised the price of its initial public offering, set to take place later this week.In an updated filing, the loss-making company said it now expected to price its shares at $24-$26, up from the $21-$24 range set last week. Valued at the midpoint of its expected price range, Workday’s IPO is set to raise $569m and give it a valuation of about $4bn.Oil group Newfield Exploration was among the highest risers on the S&P 500 index, climbing 6.1 per cent to $32.63 after it said the sale of its assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore had been finalised.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, also rose 5.7 per cent to $23.93Among materials, Cliffs Natural Resources rose 2.1 per cent to $41.68 while United States Steel rose 3.5 per cent to $21.1.Ford shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $10.09 in volatile trading after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “overweight” rating with the price target of $17.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 21.2 per cent to $84.6, making it the worst-hit stock on the S&P 500, after the cardiovascular equipment maker warned that third-quarter revenues would be lower than expected.
3;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2011-12-12T22:55:53Z;Semiconductors in sharp sell-off;;Semiconductor manufacturers sold off sharply after Intellowered fourth-quarter revenue guidance by $1bn to $13.7bn, plus or minus $300m.Intel fell 4 per cent to $24.00 while smaller rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia fell 4.3 per cent to $5.30 and 2.5 per cent to $14.53 respectively.Intel said disruption to the hard drive supply chain, a result of Thai flooding, had led PC makers to run down inventories, hitting demand for its microprocessors. It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500. Shares rose 15.4 per cent to $39.48, after its smaller rival, Martin Marietta, launched a hostile takeover, offering half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share. Martin Marietta climbed 1.7 per cent to $74.61.M&A hopes helped Netflix to a 6.2 per cent gain. Shares climbed to $75.26 on chatter than Amazon or Verizon could make a play for the video-streaming website, which has seen its share price fall from more than $300 this year.Apple provided ballast for tech shares, falling just 0.5 per cent to $391.84, as Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga, said the iPhone maker had its best November on record with sales up 17 per cent month on month.Lockheed Martin bucked the market, falling just 0.7 per cent to $74.61 after the Pentagon said it had placed a $4bn order for 30F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.Edwards Lifesciences climbed 5.1 per cent to $67.85, on the back of upgrades from several analysts. A Morgan Keegan noted pointed to the group’s strong product pipeline and prospects in China.General Motors fell 1.7 per cent to $20.80, relatively unaffected by a decision to halt production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown plant, which GM blamed on a supplier issue.
4;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2011-10-19T16:50:03Z;Clearstream highlights Aim undervaluing fears;Plenty of growth left in group;When Clearstream Technologies explained the growing use of its balloon catheters to an invited audience in February, its market capitalisation was only £12m.The fund managers, private client brokers and others were impressed by the company’s move from the traditional market in fighting coronary heart disease into the market for peripheral artery disease, which had risen to account for 60 per cent of sales after just three years. The products enable doctors to avoid amputating the feet of diabetics.When the Aim awards panel met at the beginning of September, Clearstream made the shortlist of four candidates to win International Company of the Year. But before the month was out CR Bard, a US medical devices specialist listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of $7.4bn, launched a bid at 85p a share, valuing the equity at £43.8m. Last week the offer was declared unconditional as to acceptances.The offer was at a premium of 84 per cent to the closing price on September 19, and was more than double the average closing price for the 12 months before then. It underlines the worry that many Aim companies are undervalued.While Clearstream has been profitable for the past couple of years, it is still in the growth stage, with the accompanying risks, and it has yet to pay a dividend. Bard, with its lower cost of capital, appears to have spotted a great opportunity. But it is a pity that ClearStream did not get the opportunity to remain independent for another two or three years, when it might have created an awful lot more value.It is not the first Aim company to have been snapped up by a US giant at a substantial premium, and it will not be the last. Its rocky ride since joining Aim in 2004, when the shares were priced at 79p, suggest that it came to market too early – an error that Sphere, developer of a disposable silicon diagnostic microchip, is determined to avoid.Sphere, which is based in Cambridge, will on Thursday announce plans to raise £15m and float on Aim in November with a market capitalisation of about £40m. The company’s microchip will be used to monitor and analyse in real time the blood of patients undergoing surgery and in intensive care. It will be expanded into other areas, including neonatal and renal, once regulatory approval has been granted. The IPO funds will be used to help completion of regulatory approvals, for working capital, and to launch commercial sales next year.The company was founded in 2002 to develop the technology, which came out of Siemens of Germany. It raised money in 2005, and numbers among its investors Fidelity (the biggest shareholder with 10 per cent), Herald, Schroders and Artemis. Siemens has 4 per cent, but the most interesting investor is Edwards Lifesciences, world market leader in heart valves, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of $8bn. With such a strong list of backers, it will be surprising if the flotation is not successful. The question is, how long will it remain independent once its products start to gain traction?Gervais Williams, the veteran small-cap fund manager, is almost Messianic in his belief that there is money to be made by investing in undervalued small companies. He has outlined his thoughts on the subject in “Slow Finance”, published by Bloomsbury this week. The timing is impeccable, coming as protesters at the excesses of capitalism have taken a stand outside the London Stock Exchange.According to Mr Williams the protest, which has attracted more sympathy than might have been expected, is evidence of a public change of heart towards the financial sector. He argues that investment in income-generating small companies now is like driving a four-wheel drive vehicle. Sports cars may whizz past in the good times, but when financial snow storms descend, the slower four-wheel drives will prove their worth.david.blackwell@ft.com
5;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2011-09-29T14:18:46Z;Wall St surges on German vote and GDP figures;;A flight to the safety of big name stocks seemed to be the only clear trend on a volatile day which saw strong divergence between the different US indices.The benchmark S&P 500 swung more than 3 per cent during the session, before closing 0.8 per cent up at 1,160.38. It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.

It reaffirmed its intention to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period”.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the move was widely expected: “The latest economic data has been pretty soft. The Fed would not want to make any waves right now.”He said he was focusing on the weekend’s G20 meeting in Toronto.“The G20 meeting could see some fireworks, particularly in the areas of global financial regulation, fiscal stimulus versus austerity measures, and bank taxation,” Mr Cieszynski said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent at 1,092.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.1 per cent to 10,298.44 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.3 per cent to 2,254.23.Adobe Systems, a maker of graphic-design software, declined 7.3 per cent to $30.38 as it forecast third-quarter revenue of between $950m and $1bn. Analysts on average estimated revenues of $962m.US-listed shares in BP were flat at $29.67 on news that Robert Dudley would take over the company’s response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from Tony Hayward, chief executive. New York state’s pension fund said it planned to sue the company to recover losses from the fall in the oil company’s share price due to the “disastrous” oil spill.The fund said it owned more than 19m shares when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April.Deepwater drillers moved lower on Wednesday after the Obama administration said it would appeal against a federal judge’s decision to overturn the government’s six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, imposed after the oil spill began nine weeks ago.Diamond Offshore Drilling was 0.4 per cent lower at $62.62, Noble Energy fell 2.1 per cent to $29.45 and Nabors Industries dropped 1 per cent to $20.08.The telecoms sector was the S&P 500’s best performer, boosted by a sector upgrade at Credit Suisse. The broker cited supportive valuations, fallen expectations and stabilising wireless pricing.Sprint Nextel gained 4.6 per cent to $4.52, Verizon Communications rallied 0.9 per cent to $29.33 and AT&T was 0.3 per cent higher at $25.44.Rite Aid rose 5.9 per cent to $1.07 after the drug store chain posted a first-quarter loss of 9 cents a share, better than the 14 cent loss per share expected on average by analysts, helped by lower expenses and lower charges related to store closings.The company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year. It expects a loss in the range of 41 cents to 65 cents a share and revenues in the range of $25.2bn to $25.6bn. Analysts expect a loss of 52 cents a share for the year and revenues of $25.4bn.Rival drug store chain Walgreen was 0.1 per cent up to $28.13 as the stock’s target price was raised from $27 to $29 by Meredith Adler at Barclays Capital.Edwards Lifesciencesdropped 4.9 per cent to $52.15 as Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on the company, which is focused on developing treatments for cardiovascular diseases, from “buy” to “neutral” .ZymoGenetics, a developer of treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, added 6.1 per cent to $4.53 as the stock was raised from “neutral” to “buy” at UBS.Chimera Investment fell 3.7 per cent to $3.68 as the mortgage-debt investor run by Annaly Capital Management said it planned to offer up to 100m shares of its common stock.Annaly rose 1 per cent to $17.92.Jabil Circuit was the session’s best performer as it rallied 10.6 per cent to $15.03. The electronics manufacturer said third-quarter profits, excluding non-
recurring items, would be 40 cents per share, easily topping the average analyst estimate of 34 cents."
7;EW;Edwards Lifesciences Corp;2009-02-24T00:40:08Z;Medtronic in $1bn move into heart valves;;Medtronic, the US medical devices company, on Monday agreed to pay more than $1bn for two privately-held heart valve technology companies, which have developed devices to replace heart valves without invasive open-heart surgery.CoreValve, founded in 2001 by French heart surgeon Jacques Seguin, will be bought by Medtronic for $700m (€552m, £484m) plus performance-based milestone payments.The deal is one of the biggest exits for a venture capital-backed medical device company.It will also generate the largest profit for Sofinnova, the Paris-based venture capital company that was CoreValve’s first and biggest investor. Its other venture capital backers were Apax Partners, HealthCap and Maverick Capital.CoreValve, which recently moved from Paris to California, has developed and started selling transcatheter valve implants, a less-invasive surgical technique for replacing a diseased aortic valve using a catheter inserted through an artery in the groin.Medtronic said separately that it had agreed to pay $325m to acquire Israel-based Ventor Technologies, which is also developing transcatheter heart valve technologies for aortic valve disease.Both companies compete with Edwards Lifesciences in the fast-growing market, which could eventually replace open-heart surgery for the 300,000 patients who need an aortic valve replacement every year.“From a competitive standpoint, Medtronic’s entry into the transcatheter valve market certainly raises the stakes for Edwards,” said JPMorgan in a note to clients.Analysts said the deal could stifle speculation that Medtronic could merge with Edwards.Shares of Medtronic rose 35 cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $34.35 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Edwards’ shares fell $3.05, or 4.99 per cent, to $58.05.Antoine Papiernik, managing partner at Sofinnova, told the Financial Times: “We rejected several attractive offers from big corporates to sell CoreValve a year ago.“We put our money where our mouth was and believed this was a gem that we should hold until it was the right time to sell.”He said the deal would generate more than 10-times return on the investment by Sofinnova, which was the sole participant in CoreValve’s initial €4.5m ($5.7m) round of financing in 2003.CoreValve has sold 2,600 of its ReValving Systems, which cost €18,500-€20,000, in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America.It is still awaiting approval to be sold in the US, where it plans to start human trials this year.Mr Papiernik said the company turned profitable in the fourth quarter of last year.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
