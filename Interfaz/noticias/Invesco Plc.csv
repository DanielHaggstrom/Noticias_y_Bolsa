Like Carrousel, it buys into companies trading at significant discounts and presses for improvements to performance.Fidelity remains a significant shareholder of Fidelity Asian Values with a stake of about 15 per cent, according to Mr Cade.
1;IVZ;Invesco Plc;2007-10-26T16:34:22Z;Filling in the spaces profitably;;"W ith commercial property looking an increasingly uncertain proposition, the broader infrastructure industry is becoming the target for investors seeking similar returns with lower risk.Funds have been launched in the last few months to take advantage of the demand for such assets, which typically range from toll roads and hospitals to prisons, airports and army barracks.“Infrastructure is becoming better understood as an asset class,” says Stephen Vineberg, global head of infrastructure at First Street, which runs a number of funds.“A lot of investors are looking for a replacement for property in their portfolios, or a surrogate for the yields provided by bonds.”Vineberg says the main advantage over property and other asset classes is that infrastructure assets tend to be less cyclical. “People need water or electricity or to drive to work or fly, which means there should be a relatively consistent and predictable cash flow.”At the end of September, First State launched a listed infrastructure fund for UK retail investors. And earlier, in May, it launched a diversified infrastructure fund, seeded with an interest in Anglian Water.The illiquid nature of infrastructure assets make them a good fit for investment companies. There have been a number raised in the past two years, including funds from HSBC, 3i and Babcock & Brown.Infrastructure often carries very similar income characteristics to property, says Tony Roper, manager for the HSBC Infrastructure fund. “We are basically a yield with some growth,” he says. “We invest in projects that offer long-term government- backed income streams that are unlikely to be affected by any economic downturn, making us pretty low risk.”His fund yielded 6.1 pence last year, slightly less than 6 per cent, but it aims for a long- term internal rate of return of between 8 to 9 per cent. It is also more conservative than some, owing to a focus on secure government income from assets such as hospitals.But he says not all infrastructure funds are the same. Some carry higher risks, and potentially higher returns.The other mainstream investment companies –
Babcock & Brown and 3i – have similar characteristics, although the 3i fund offers a higher target return of 12
per cent and is generally regarded as slightly higher- risk.More risky assets, Roper says, include ports and motorway service stations, while other smaller funds specialise in start-up infrastructure projects in specific locations.There are, for example, companies on AIM that specialise in projects in Korea and South Africa – companies that are relatively risky and illiquid to trade, but potentially lucrative.In fact, infrastructure funds offer one way to gain an exposure to the emerging markets boom. The Invesco Asia infrastructure fund, for example, invests in Asian infrastructure securities, offering a safer way to access such assets.Perhaps a sign of the increasing acceptance of infrastructure investing was the decision this month by London hedge fund group CQS to double the size of
its company specialising in financing offshore oil and
gas rigs.Tom Tuite-Dalton, director at Arbuthnot Securities, broker to the fund, says it produced a total return of more than 6 per cent since launch in December, despite challenging conditions for credit funds. In total, it targets a gross yield of 8 per cent
a year.CQS is already backed by large funds such as Baillie Gifford’s Monks, Axa Framlington, Midas and Invesco.Justin Urquhart Stewart, of Seven Investment Management, says about 4 per cent of its average balanced investor portfolio is now invested into infrastructure funds, having moved out of commercial property last year. But he warns that the growing popularity of the area might prove a curse.“So much money is now going in that valuations are very high and investors have to pay to go in.”"
2;IVZ;Invesco Plc;2006-10-26T10:08:44Z;Better way to handle Asian currencies;;"Calls for government co-ordination of exchange rates to manage global imbalances are misguided. For a lesson in how exchange rate intervention can wreak monetary havoc, just look to the Plaza and Louvre agreements.The Group of Five industrialised nations – the US, the UK, Japan, ­Germany and France – met in New York in 1985 to agree on collective action to lower the value of the dollar. China was not a factor as its foreign exchange reserves were only $12.7bn and its overall current account was roughly in balance.The G5 nations’ intervention in the foreign exchange markets, plus changes in fiscal policies, did help to bring down the value of the dollar. But two years later the­
US current account deficit reached a peak of 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product, prompting the G6 (the G5 plus Canada) to meet in Paris to reverse course.Worse, after the 1987 accord, the Bank of Japan bought dollars and allowed the monetary base to grow ­rapidly, creating the bubble economy of the late 1980s. The bubble burst in 1990 after the BoJ sharply cut money growth in mid-1989.The countries that suffered the most from the Asian financial crisis that followed were those that had ­mistaken monetary policy. As John Greenwood, chief economist for Invesco Asia, observed: “The general lesson is that to control money and credit growth within reasonable ranges that are compatible with low inflation in the longer run, the external value of the currency must be free to adjust – especially upwards.”Today, there are other factors that make an exchange rate accord even less likely to succeed. The US current account deficit has risen to more than 6 per cent of GDP; China is now the world’s third largest trading nation; and Asian central banks play an ­important role in financing the US budget deficit. A new Plaza accord would require a much larger group to reach agreement – the Group of 20 – without any credible enforcement mechanism.A negotiated approach to resolving trade imbalances presumes that “experts” know the relevant market-clearing exchange rates and that governments can agree to enforce them – neither of which has proved to be true. Any exchange rate that was fundamentally misaligned would eventually be attacked and governments would be ill-equipped to prevent it. Moreover, the longer that adjustment was delayed, the higher the cost would be in terms of resource misallocation.Rather than a new Plaza agreement, an alternative approach to correcting global imbalances would be to have monetary authorities agree on common principles and objectives. The aim would be to establish credibility by having central banks commit to long-run price stability.Hans Genberg, executive director for research at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has suggested ­creating a “zone of monetary stability” in east Asia.The crucial step would be to agree on a credible inflation target regime. To be consistent with capital freedom, central banks would not intervene to peg exchange rates. The information contained in flexible rates would be useful in the conduct of monetary ­policy and some monetary authorities might choose to follow the Singaporean model by using the exchange rate as an operating target. Hong Kong would maintain its currency board and have a hard peg to the dollar.With regional price stability and financial integration, interest rates would converge and exchange rates would be less volatile. Although a ­common currency might evolve – either for the region or, more likely, for a smaller bloc of countries – it would not be necessary to realise those benefits.China needs an independent central bank to stabilise the growth of nominal income and prevent inflation. Relaxing capital controls would take pressure off the yuan/dollar exchange rate, while interest rate liberalisation would allow a more efficient allocation of capital.The problem is to get China to adopt liberal economic principles when its political regime is illiberal. For the US to threaten China with protectionist measures for failing to adopt liberal principles is counter- productive. Carrying out that threat would make both China and the US less liberal.The writer is a China specialist and vice-president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute"
3;IVZ;Invesco Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
