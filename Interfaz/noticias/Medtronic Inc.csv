The group said on Tuesday it would sell the units that make its feeding tubes and compression machines for deep vein thrombosis, as well as a patient care business that manufactures dressings for wounds, syringes and other supplies.Medtronic is shedding assets following the completion of its almost $50bn acquisition of Ireland’s Covidien in 2015. The deal was one of the last major “inversions”, which allowed the company to reduce its US tax bill by moving its legal headquarters to Dublin.“We came to the conclusion that these products — while truly meaningful to patients in need — are best suited under ownership that can provide the investment and focus that these businesses require,” said Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s chief executive.Mr Ishrak said Medtronic would allocate $1bn of the proceeds to buying back its shares and the remainder to reducing the company’s net debt of more than $29bn.Shares in Medtronic rose 1.89 per cent in premarket trading in New York to $81.88, giving the company a market value of more than $112bn.However, shares in Cardinal Health tumbled by more than 10 per cent, as the group warned investors its earnings this year would be at the lower end of a previously published range of $5.35 to $5.50 a share. Cardinal reported revenues of $121.5bn in its most recent fiscal year, which runs to the end of June. The company blamed weak performance at its unit distributing generic copycat drugs, which have been commanding a lower price amid cut-throat competition.Medtronic will hand over 17 of its roughly 90 factories to Cardinal Health as part of the sale of the medical businesses, which generated roughly $2.4bn in sales in the last four quarters. Medtronic’s total sales were $28.8bn in fiscal 2016, which ended last April.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the medical devices industry as large players such as Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson each try to narrow their focus to compete with smaller operators that concentrate on a particular niche.In 2015, Cardinal Health acquired Cordis from J&J for about $2bn, adding a portfolio of medical devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Last year, J&J, the world’s largest healthcare company, said it would cut 3,000 jobs at its medical devices unit as part of a restructuring effort designed to save up to $1bn a year in costs.
1;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2017-04-18T11:18:26Z;Cardinal Health to buy Medtronic units for $6.1bn;;Cardinal Health disclosed on Tuesday a deal to buy Medtronic’s patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses for $6.1bn in cash.The units encompass almost two dozen product categories, which are “used in nearly every US hospital,” Cardinal said. They generated revenues of $2.3bn in the 12 months to the end of October 2016, with 70 per cent of sales coming from the US.George Barrett, Cardinal’s chief executive, said:We are thrilled about today’s announcement, as this well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years.Cardinal said it will finance the transaction with $4.5bn in new senior unsecured notes and existing cash. The group’s shares fell by 7.1 per cent in pre-market trading. Medtronic rose 1.4 per cent.
2;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2016-11-22T12:36:21Z;Medtronic shares fall after it reports ‘disappointing’ quarterly sales growth;;Medical device maker Medtronic on Tuesday said revenue grew slower than expected in the past quarter, prompting it to narrow its full-year sales outlook as it looks to new products to help boost sales, particularly in its critical cardiac and vascular division.Medtronic shares took a hit from the news, falling about 6 per cent in pre-market trading.The company said that quarterly sales grew 4 per cent to $7.34bn from a year earlier, still shy of Wall Street’s expectations of $7.46bn from the past quarter and failing to meet its previously announced fiscal-year revenue growth target of consistent 5-6 per cent growth.Medtronic chairman and chief executive Omar Ishrak said the revenue growth was “disappointing and did not meet our expectations.” He blamed the slower pace of growth on the fact that it is waiting for new product introductions to rev up growth in its cardiac and vascular products group – its largest source of revenue – amid a declining market for cardiac rhythm and heart failure products.He also pointed to the diabetes division, where insulin pump sales slowed in anticipation of the launch of its new products, including its MiniMed 670G system. That product just secured the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval in September, and is on track to be commercially available in the US this spring, the company said.Despite the disappointment on revenue, Medtronic said its earnings were largely in line with analysts’ expectations, posting $1.11bn in net income – a 111 per cent increase from the same period a year ago – translating to diluted earnings per share of 80 cents, compared to Wall Street’s forecast of $1.12bn in income and 80.6 cents per share.It said that it received a boost this quarter from its recent acquisition of cardiac device company HeartWare earlier this year for about $1.1bn, as well as a positive foreign currency boost worth $50m.The middling growth from the past quarter caused Medtronic to pare back its outlook for the year. It now expects to see yearly revenue growth within a mid-single digit range, as opposed to the upper half of the mid-single digit range it previously signaled, and revenue growth for the second half of the fiscal year to be in the mid-single digit range. It is also expecting to feel the bite from a strengthening dollar, projecting that to take a $20m-$60m bite out of its revenue for the fiscal year.

The business, which generated revenue of $56m last year – just over 1 percent of Smith & Nephew’s total sales – is best known for its Truclear system that is used in the removal of uterine tissue.Smith & Nephew said the sale will mean the business will “benefit from increased focus and presence in the gynaecology space, including broadening the products and services available to customers”.The $300m share buyback programme will start shortly after the deal is expected to complete, in July.Olivier Bohuon, chief executive of Smith & Nephew, said:The quality of the gynaecology business was reflected by the strong interest from potential buyers, allowing us to obtain an attractive valuation. Our shareholders will benefit directly from the return of the proceeds through a share buy-back programme, in-line with our capital allocation framework. Gynaecology and its employees will benefit from a new owner with a synergistic platform looking to take the business to the next level.

Mr Stevens believes this trend can help improve productivity in the NHS as he pursues a target to save £22bn a year by 2020.Nice, the cost-effectiveness watchdog for the public-funded health system, found that the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system would help reduce the £55m spent annually by the NHS treating people with low glucose levels, or hypoglycaemia.The device, made by Medtronic of the US, costs £3,000 and an additional £4,900 a year to operate. Nice estimated this outlay would produce an average annual saving of up to £1,500 per user through reduced ambulance call-outs and hospital admissions.The device was recommended for use by type 1 diabetics who experienced “disabling hypoglycaemia” — defined as repeated and unpredictable low-blood sugar attacks.Type 1 diabetes, which affects almost 400,000 people in the UK, develops most often among young people and causes the destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.Carole Longson, Nice’s director of health technology evaluation, said that, as well as benefiting diabetics, automatic glucose monitoring would also ease the anxiety of carers. She cited the example of parents who might wake several times a night to check for potentially fatal low blood sugar levels in a diabetic child.Digital devices are not without their own risks. Regulators have found reliability problems with some glucose monitors and insulin pumps. Concerns have also been raised about the risk of devices being hacked into, with potentially lethal consequences. The US Food and Drug Administration issued guidelines last month urging manufacturers to increase cyber security measures in medical technology.However, Mr Stevens is convinced that the benefits of “connected healthcare” outweigh the risks. He launched a scheme last month called “innovation test beds” to trial wearable monitors and other technology aimed at improving care of the elderly and people with chronic diseases and mental health problems.The NHS has been criticised in the past for being too slow in its adoption of new technology. Research carried out for the Financial Times this week showed that productivity in NHS hospitals had fallen for a third year running.

That’s why everything is fair game to them and why companies active in sectors mentioned in the five-year plans have to be extra vigilant.”The latest plan covering 2016 to 2020 — the 13th under the Communist regime — focuses on modernising the military and improving green technology, including defence stealth technology and renewable energy. Innovation also plays a central role in the programme, with Beijing calling for more advances in everything from aircraft engines to “quantum teleportation”.Information superiority is the name of the game“There’s a direct connection between the sectors highlighted in China’s five-year plans and the businesses that suffer breaches in the US,” said Peter LaMontagne, chief executive of big data analytics firm Novetta and a US diplomat in Beijing during the 1990s. “And if it’s a priority for China, it should be a priority for companies in the US to protect themselves.”China still relies on adapting technology and best practices from overseas for development. At the same time, Beijing’s five-year plan will launch during one of the slowest periods of growth in decades, which could encourage more cyber economic espionage, cyber security experts say.Tom Kellermann, chief cyber security officer for software firm TrendMicro, said the sectors that have been targeted by China have been severely hurt because companies benefiting from the breaches have been able to copy or improve products based on stolen data and then undercut US firms in pricing.“The US needs to develop its own five-year plan to combat cyber threats,” Mr Kellermann said. “Information superiority is the name of the game and the countries that will be successful will deal with these threats in a more systematic way, whether it’s nation states or non-state actors that are improving their capabilities in a dramatic way.”Xinhua breaks the mould with a groovy propaganda video explaining the Communist party of China’s 13th five-year planRead moreUnder the threat of sanctions against Chinese companies, Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged during a September visit to the White House that Beijing would not engage in the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets through hacks.But US intelligence officials say they have not noticed any decrease in cyber economic espionage activities since that agreement was announced. Previously, the FBI said there has been a 53 per cent increase in breaches to steal trade secrets, which the agency blamed on China.Novetta and several other cyber security firms issued a report last year saying the 12th five-year plan was one of the reasons for the existence of the cyber threat group dubbed “Axiom”, which struck at numerous Fortune 500 companies in telecommunications, energy, pharmaceuticals and elsewhere.The report also noted that the semiconductor and network device manufacturing businesses were highlighted in the 12th five-year plan, with evidence showing those industries were hit by hacks.“The 12th five-year plan displays China’s new direction of pursuing advanced technology and advanced R&D efforts,” the report said. “As China begins its shift away from dependence on foreign technology (specifically the US), more and more corporations and organisations may be targeted by Axiom.”In May 2014, the US charged five Chinese military officers with cyber spying, alleging they hacked the computer systems of five US companies and a labour union. This was the first time Washington had singled out a foreign government for such offences.While Westinghouse was building four nuclear power plants in China, Sun Kailiang is said to have stolen high level email correspondence and the design plans for the layout of piping at the plants in 2010 and 2011.In 2010, US Steel was involved in trade cases with Chinese steel companies. According to the US, Mr Sun launched a “spearphishing” attack on US Steel employees related to the case by sending them fake emails that secretly released malware into their computer system once opened. Three days later, Wang Dong also stole descriptions of US Steel computers.SolarWorldWen Xinyu and an unidentified accomplice stole financial and operational information, including SolarWorld’s cash flow, production line information and costs in 2012.Aerospace Technology InstituteAfter ATI embarked on a joint venture with a state-owned enterprise in 2012, Mr Wen stole network login details for nearly every ATI employee.AlcoaMr Kailiang launched a spearphishing email attack on Alcoa shortly after the metal manufacturer announced a partnership with a Chinese SOE in 2008.In 2012, Mr Wen stole emails from employees of the USW workers union which contained confidential information regarding an ongoing public dispute over Chinese trade practices.

That has added acute pressure to the Russell 2000 biotech index — home to younger, less-established small-cap biotech groups — whose valuations are dependent on future cash flows and a continued wave of merger and acquisition activity.Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, said valuations had become “aggressive, particularly in the small-cap space” after a sustained six-year rally.“Whenever you have aggressive valuations, any sniff that [the sector] may not be able to deliver — and today we had concerns about pricing power — you’ll have an outsize reaction,” he said.Valuations have been a concern for investors in US equities this year, who have broadly preferred European and Japanese stocks as central banks there continue to ease.The Nasdaq biotech index trades at 41.86 times forward earnings, down from a peak of 55.76 earlier this year but a substantial premium to other parts of the US stock market, according to FactSet. In contrast, S&P 500 healthcare companies — including blue-chips such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth — trade at 16.75 times expected earnings over the next 12 months.“While healthcare in general is reasonably priced, biotech valuations are stretched,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “It’s hard to put a p/e on a dream.”Those valuations have been supported by an expanding drug pipeline and a surge in deals. Some 747 mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries worth nearly $300bn since the year began, up 46 per cent from the same point in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Analysts with Citi warned that political rhetoric would intensify, which they argued could “impact the assessment of potential acquisition targets” by blue-chip pharmaceutical groups seeking growth through M&A.Against a backdrop of slow economic expansion, boards of US companies have often decided to buy faster growing companies instead of investing in research and development. The prospect of strong earnings and sales growth, often linked to successful medical trials, has appealed to investors after two consecutive quarters of sales declines by the S&P 500.Earnings for healthcare companies within the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 13 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, faster than any other sector, according to S&P Capital IQ.The potential for blockbuster new drugs has also enticed investors. Analysts with Barclays note that roughly a dozen biotechs have key catalysts before year end, including data from trials undertaken by Gilead, Biogen Idec, Neurocrine Biosciences and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Gilead has epitomised how a novel medical treatment can catapult a company’s share price and valuation. Sales at the company, known for its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, have more than tripled over the past four years, while its market valuation has soared from $29bn to $155bn.Despite the recent declines, the Nasdaq biotech index remains 10.4 per cent above where it started the year, outpacing the 0.4 per cent advance by the overall Nasdaq Composite. Shares of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Exelixis and Prothena Corp have all climbed more than 100 per cent.Biotechs have also seen strong demand for new issuance. Some 94 companies have come to market, raising a total of $8.5bn year-to-date, Dealogic data shows. The figure is tracking ahead of the record $11.6bn raised in 2010, when 77 companies floated. Of the 39 debuts in the US, share prices have advanced 24 per cent on average.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
7;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2015-08-04T16:31:11Z;Smiths: Value, Act 2;The activist fund is likely to take issue with the conglomerate structure;An unkind view of activist investors’ modus operandi is as follows: Buy shares. Go public about holding. Bang on about need to sell divisions, or the entire company. Watch share price rise as media fixates on potential for M&A. Then sell and bank tidy profit.If that is the case, then ValueAct’s work is already half done. Rolls-Royce shares are up 10 per cent since the hedge fund revealed itself as the engineering group’s biggest investor last week. Smiths Group rose 6 per cent on Tuesday after ValueAct took a smaller stake there— joining fellow US investors Harris Associates on the engineering conglomerate’s register.The two companies have much in common. Both are engineers whose shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 over the past year. Both have new chief executives ( yet to start, in Smiths’ case). Both have reported indifferent financial results.But while the immediate focus at Rolls is likely to be improving operational performance, most likely by cutting costs quicker, at Smiths the obvious issue is structure. Yes, being a conglomerate may smooth group earnings from what are inherently cyclical businesses. But there is little obvious synergy between some of its five divisions, ranging from seals for oil and gas pipelines to sensors for airport security detectors.Take the group’s medical devices division, which contributed 34 per cent of operating profit in the first half. Analysts at Credit Suisse calculate it could be worth £3.15bn — against a current enterprise value of £5.47bn.Philip Bowman, the outgoing chief executive, was widely expected to refocus the group via disposals. That he did not was partly down to the company’s pension deficit, which in accounting terms stands at £338m. UK pensions law could oblige the company to make good that deficit in the event of a substantial disposal. But relief may soon be at hand. Bond yields, the basis of pension deficit accounting, look likely to rise as markets price in interest rate rises in the US and UK. In time, that could whittle away the deficit and clear the way for disposals — allowing ValueAct to help finish the job without having to make much noise.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
8;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2015-04-13T21:27:46Z;IBM strikes digital health deal with Apple, Medtronic and J&J;Doctors, researchers and insurers can gain access to Apple Watch health data;IBM has struck partnerships with Apple and the world’s biggest makers of medical devices, to put health data from Apple Watches into the hands of doctors and insurers, and to create personalised treatments for hip replacement patients and diabetics.IBM’s push into digital healthcare will allow users monitoring their heart rate, calories burnt and cholesterol levels using Apple’s HealthKit platform to upload the information from an IBM app to a storage cloud, where it will be accessible to their doctors and insurance companies. Those who opt in to Apple’s ResearchKit will also be able to share their data with medical researchers.The agreement is the latest instance of deeper ties between the healthcare and technology sectors, in anticipation of an explosion in the amount of medical data that people collect using their smartphones or “wearables” like the Fitbit or Apple Watch.John Kelly, senior vice-president at IBM, described Apple’s HealthKit and ResearchKit platforms as “really unique” but said there was currently “no systematic way of pulling the data together and sending it” to physicians or clinical researchers. “We are . . . providing a huge cloud and a secure database as a backstop,” he said.IBM’s partnership with Apple is not exclusive, but the group said few companies could offer the iPhone maker the same storage and security capabilities. “[Apple’s] sense is that this is very sensitive data. They feel really good about our reputation for operating secure data centres,” said Mr Kelly.IBM said it would also market a set of analytical tools to physicians, researchers and insurers, enabling them to collate the data from Apple’s devices with patients’ electronic medical records so they could spot patterns to support clinical trials or help bring down rising healthcare costs.The tools will be built using Watson, IBM’s “cognitive computing system”, which can query large sets of statistics and identify patterns.“The average patient will collect a terabyte of medical data in their lifetime. Our analytics will be able to find the dots, the clues that are eluding us, and find new breakthroughs,” said Michael Rhodin, senior vice-president of IBM Watson.Mr Rhodin said he expected consumers, especially younger ones known as “millennials”, to opt in to having their data used in clinical research trials because they had a vested interest in contributing to the next big medical advance.“The generation who buy Apple Watches are interested in data philanthropy,” he said. “Many of them have been touched by relatives or parents struck down by disease. Why wouldn’t they help researchers figure out what’s going on?”IBM’s partnership with Apple was announced alongside a handful of other healthcare tie-ups, including with Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, the world’s largest makers of medical devices such as insulin pumps and replacement knees and hips.The generation who buy Apple Watches are interested in data philanthropyJ&J has asked IBM to build a “coaching system” to ensure patients are fit enough to undergo spinal surgery or joint replacement, and to encourage them to do the right exercises after their operation. The system would prod the patient into doing more physical activity if they were not losing enough weight ahead of their procedure, for example.J&J recently announced a separate collaboration with Google to build a new generation of surgical robots.IBM is also working with Medtronic on a smart diabetes treatment system that would take readings from a patient’s glucose monitor and ensure their insulin pump dispenses the precise amount of drug required.A new IBM unit known as Watson Health will house the healthcare ventures, which the company hopes will help revive its flagging fortunes. It said it had reached agreements to acquire Explorys and Phytel, two US-based companies in the field of healthcare analytics, to bolster its data crunching capabilities. Financial terms were not disclosed.The group, known as “Big Blue”, has been contending with shrinking revenue for three years, as new cloud computing enterprises struggle to fill the gap left by the troubled hardware units it has sold off.It struck a deal with Twitter in October to apply data from the microblogging network to real-time business decisions for IBM’s enterprise customers. Last July it signed a separate alliance with Apple to find business applications for consumer devices such as iPhones and iPads.
9;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;M&A helps lift US healthcare stocks;Rising profits blunt concerns that the sector is overvalued;Gilead Sciences, the biotech behemoth that has seen its market valuation soar to a cool $145bn, has put in a strong performance over the past 14 months with its shares rising more than 30 per cent.The gain, however, is seemingly modest compared with many of Gilead’s compatriots, several of which doubled over the same period. A dozen of its S&P 500 peers have climbed more than 40 per cent.US healthcare stocks have staged a vibrant rally over the past six years, buoyed by novel drug treatments, an ageing population and industry-wide consolidation. Rising profits have blunted concerns that the sector is overvalued and equity strategists on Wall Street continue to recommend that clients invest in the industry.Since the start of 2014, the S&P 500 healthcare index has advanced 26 per cent, including gains of more than 100 per cent by Hospira, Mallinckrodt and Allergan — two of which agreed to takeovers — while the Nasdaq biotech index has climbed 40 per cent. The wider S&P 500 has risen 11.5 per cent over the same period.“More than any other sector, healthcare is benefiting from strong demographic and secular trends: ageing population, expanding insurance coverage, growing middle-class around the world, new product launches,” says Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, equity strategist with JPMorgan.The fourth-quarter earnings season added to Mr Lakos-Bujas’s confidence. “Healthcare companies reported the strongest organic growth of all sectors — 11 per cent revenue growth and 22 per cent earnings growth — and ranked the highest on beats,” he says.That trend is likely to continue. S&P 500 healthcare earnings per share are expected to climb 8.9 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, outpacing forecasts for a 1.7 per cent rise in the broader blue-chip index, data from S&P Capital IQ show. The industry’s sales growth, projected at 7.1 per cent this year, is thought to only trail the tech sector’s 9.1 per cent year-on-year gain.The brisk pace of growth has made valuations more palatable, says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. Mr Ablin points to metrics including the price-to-sales ratio, which stands at 1.84 times 2015 results for the S&P 500 healthcare sector, in line with the blue-chip index and below that of the technology complex.“In general, we like cheap sectors that are moving in the right direction and healthcare has been cheap relative to its peers pretty consistently for the last six years,” he says.Strategists with Barclays note the biotech sector has fuelled much of the earnings growth within the healthcare industry, as companies like Gilead bring new products to market. The California-based company’s revenues more than doubled in 2014 to $24.9bn, while its profits rose nearly fourfold to $12.1bn. Analysts on Wall Street expect sales of the company’s blockbuster Harvoni and Sovaldi hepatitis C treatments to top $61bn between 2015 and the end of 2018.“Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader markets,” says Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.Portfolio managers have increased exposure to the sector through new issues, with healthcare companies raising more than $10bn through initial public offerings in 2014, the highest level in at least two decades, according to Dealogic.Merger and acquisition activity has also buoyed valuations, with $10bn-plus deals announced between Allergan and Actavis, Covidien and Medtronic, Hospira and Pfizer as well as CareFusion and Becton Dickinson. The prospect of further consolidation has acted as a floor on share prices, and bankers and investors on Wall Street broadly expect the pace of deals to continue.“There were three things driving M&A over the past year, and two of the three are intact,” says Marshall Gordon, senior healthcare analyst at ClearBridge Investments, which has $115bn assets under management. “The first, big companies still need more products, their growth is somewhat uneven and some still need a help in the shorter term. Secondly, financing continues to be extremely inexpensive.”Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader marketsBut the third driver fizzled when the US Treasury Department clamped down on tax inversions last autumn, killing AbbVie’s $55bn merger with Shire. A deal in Washington to tax overseas cash piles, remove certain credits or to introduce a tax on foreign earnings, none certain to pass, could also weigh on the sector — a point Citi has highlighted as it rates the sector underweight.“Individual companies though could experience major shifts, especially if certain deductions would be removed like R&D tax credits which benefit technology, biotech, drug and med-tech companies the most,” says Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist with Citi.Morgan Stanley recently cooled on the healthcare sector, shifting to a market-weight rating after four years in the overweight camp in December. The sector came under pressure in early February after Gilead warned it would cut the price of its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill as insurers and pharmacy benefit managers angled for greater discounts. The reverberations were clear: payers were pushing back.For Morgan Stanley and Citi, another point sticks out: after six years of gains, valuations are not as attractive as they once were.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
11;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2015-02-10T19:06:20Z;Healthcare: The race to cure rising drug costs;Critics question whether big pharma’s premium pricing model can endure;"Since contracting hepatitis C 25 years ago, Lucinda Porter’s biggest fear has been that she would infect someone else with the deadly virus. “Whenever I cut myself and saw the smeared blood, I would panic,” she says.Within days of contracting the illness, Ms Porter was hit with severe fatigue, weakness and a loss of appetite. She spent most of the next two decades trapped in a “low-level brain fog”, unable to concentrate and prone to severe bouts of muscle-pain and fever.She tried two courses of treatment, both of which failed. By 2003, she had to face up to the possibility that she would die from hepatitis C, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.“I’ve seen people die from this . . . it is one of the worst deaths there is,” says Ms Porter, a nurse.Ten years later, she took part in a clinical trial for a new drug called Harvoni. Within days she knew the treatment was working and after three months doctors declared her effectively cured.Ms Porter is one of 140,000 Americans that have been treated by one of Gilead Science’s hepatitis C drugs since they were launched two years ago. Harvoni and Sovaldi, an older version of the pill, are seen as “miracle drugs”, offering cure rates of over 94 per cent.But Gilead has become the symbol of out-of-control drug prices in the US. A 12-week treatment costs $94,500, or $1,125 a pill, attracting unwanted attention from politicians and doctors, who identify the group as one of the most hated companies in pharmaceuticals.Peter Bach, a doctor and director at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, reflects the views of many in his profession when he accuses it of “corrupting behaviour”.“Gilead is a test case in the court of public opinion,” he says. “It has become the poster child for high drug prices.”The controversy has also highlighted the broader question of whether pharmaceutical companies can defend their premium pricing model in the world’s biggest healthcare market. The evidence of recent weeks suggests it is a battle that big pharma risks losing, raising questions over the economic model of an industry that relies heavily on US profits to reward investors and finance new drugs.After less than a year on the market, Gilead has faced a concerted push to lower the price of Harvoni. Seizing an opportunity created by the approval in December of a rival hepatitis C treatment from AbbVie, another US drugs group, the insurers and employers who fund US healthcare have forced deep discounts from both companies in return for access to patients.Such aggressive tactics had not been commonplace in the US, where patient choice has reigned supreme. Yet there are growing signs of similar behaviour in other areas, including treatments for asthma and diabetes, as the groups that fund US healthcare take a tougher approach to containing costs.“Without any doubt there is pressure on price in the US,” says Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, which has been in a price battle over respiratory drugs with its UK rival GlaxoSmithKline. “We’ve seen what has happened in [hepatitis C] and insulin, we see it in respiratory; it is going to be an issue in oncology. The market is . . . more challenging than it was five years ago.”Price pressuresDirect federal government intervention in drug prices is barred under US law – testament, critics say, to big pharma’s lobbying power on Capitol Hill. But President Barack Obama’s health reform – the Affordable Care Act – has created incentives to control costs, while consolidation among healthcare providers has also shifted bargaining power from drug companies to their customers.The combination of these forces could result in the US applying the brake to rising healthcare costs which, at 18 per cent of gross domestic product, far exceed those of any other nation.Prescription medicine prices account for about a tenth of these costs and rose almost 11 per cent last year, according to the Truveris National Drug Index. This makes drug companies a prime target for an efficiency drive that many experts see as long overdue.Without any doubt there is pressure on price in the US . . . The market is more challenging than it was five years agoGilead’s hepatitis C pills proved so controversial because they combined an expensive drug with a large patient population. A pill at $1,000 each is not unheard of but very expensive drugs are usually aimed at rare diseases, as the company has to charge more per patient to recoup its costs.The number of people with hepatitis C is huge, with more than 3m infected in the US alone. As soon as Gilead launched its new drugs, medical professionals warned that they risked busting the system. But the return for Gilead’s investors has been huge, as demonstrated by the company’s 2014 profits, which more than tripled to $13.3bn.Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest of the pharmacy benefits managers which negotiate with drug companies, has had Gilead in his sights for more than a year after it refused to offer meaningful discounts.A self-styled scourge of high drug costs, he set out to engineer a price war as soon as AbbVie launched its rival Vikera drug in December. Dr Miller agreed to treat Express Scripts patients exclusively with Vikera in exchange for a hefty, but undisclosed, discount. The market reaction was swift: investors wiped more than $20bn off Gilead’s market value in a single day.Gilead then unveiled its own exclusive deals with many of Express Scripts’ rivals but this month it warned investors it was being forced to offer discounts of almost 50 per cent, a revelation that again sent its shares tumbling and prompted a sharp sell-off of other pharmaceutical stocks.GSK has been another victim of Dr Miller’s emboldened approach to negotiations. The UK group saw a sharp fall in revenues last year after its asthma drug, Advair, was taken off Express Scripts’ list of preferred medicines – effectively removing it from many insurance plans. It regained access this year after offering a discount.“You are going to see a lot more of this,” says Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK. “I don’t particularly like it because I think patient choice is important but ultimately if a market is going to move in that direction we have to engage with it . . . it is definitely something which has moved dramatically over the past 18 months.”Confronting big pharmaExpress Scripts and its rivals say these skirmishes are only the start of a more confrontational relationship with big pharma. The next battleground is cancer drugs – one of the most profitable areas of the industry, with many treatments priced at more than $100,000 a year.If we take away too much decision-making from physicians, then we start to go down a slippery slope in healthcareYet Dr Miller admits it will be much harder to tame the cost of cancer drugs. In the case of hepatitis C, there was a competing product that also offered an effective cure, but “demonstrating the success of a cancer drug is much more ambiguous”, says Dr Miller. “If you have a tumour shrinkage but it doesn’t prolong survival, is that a good response or not?”Then there are several cancer drugs that do prolong survival, but not by very long, such as Eli Lilly’s Cyramza, which extends the life of patients with lung cancer by less than six weeks at a cost of around $24,000.John Lechleiter, Eli Lilly’s chief executive, dismisses as “hogwash” the idea that incremental improvements are not worth paying for. “If you go back to the mid-1990s, I think median survival times were nine months. But in these increments of one or two months, we’ve got to the point now of 16 or 18 months.”Also under fire are industry tactics that critics say keep drug prices artificially high. In December, Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney-general, won a preliminary injunction against Actavis, which prevented it from instigating a so-called “forced switch” on Namenda, its Alzheimer’s drug. Actavis had stopped selling the pill and told doctors to move patients to a newer version, Namenda XR.The patent on the older drug expires in July, at which point it will face competition from generic “copycat” versions, whereas the newer pill is protected
until 2025.“If we start to take away too much decision making from physicians to prescribe what they think their patients need, then we start to go down a slippery slope that is not good for healthcare,” says Brent Saunders, Actavis chief executive, of the injunction.Much of the drug price inflation is down to the structure of the US healthcare system, which lacks the kind of central government negotiator seen in many of the “single-payer” set-ups that are common in Europe. The Food and Drug Administration only has to consider whether a medicine is safe and effective, not whether it is good value for money.That decision is left up to individual insurance companies that have done a poor job of controlling prices – which cynics put down to the fact that higher drug prices are used to justify higher premiums.Medicare, a government programme that funds healthcare coverage for almost 50m, mostly senior, Americans, is banned from negotiating any discounts on drugs.Funding researchPharmaceutical executives say their ability to price drugs in the US according to what the market will bear allows them to cover the considerable cost of finding new, often revolutionary, treatments; the cost of developing and winning approval for a new drug now runs at $2.6bn, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, compared with $802m in 2003.If there is one thing that the pharma industry and those who foot the US healthcare bill agree on, it is that the US is paying too much relative to other western countries, especially Europe. With only 4.6 per cent of the world’s population, the US is responsible for 33 per cent of global drug spending.The rest of the world is hardly rushing to pick up a bigger share of the bill. Europe and Japan, faced with ageing populations and big fiscal challenges, are trying to contain rising healthcare costs. Developing economies such as China and Brazil also want to keep a tight lid on drug prices as they expand still-fragile health systems.In India, meanwhile, western drugmakers have faced aggressive patent challenges in an attempt to open their drugs to low-cost competition from local generic rivals.If the US price premium is reduced, it will have to come straight from industry margins. With average gross profit margins of about 67 per cent, critics argue big pharma can afford the hit. But industry executives warn that, with activist investors circling the industry in search of efficiency savings, any dent to earnings would inevitably put pressure on research and development.Such arguments fail to sway Dr Miller, who says the status quo is unsustainable. “The US worker is being gouged to fund innovation for everyone. America can no longer be solely responsible for all of pharma’s profits.”***Treatment: Specialist labs and big data aid focus on pricingHealthcare companies are experimenting with different ways of charging for treatment in an attempt to move ahead of the debate over the rising cost of drugs and therapies.Medtronic, a medical devices company, has started offering to treat patients with cardiac conditions at a single fixed price through its network of so-called “catheterisation laboratories”, where doctors can visualise a patient’s arteries and heart chambers and treat abnormalities.Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chief executive, says the company works out what a cath lab patient is costing the hospital, and then offers “to reduce that by X amount, depending on the situation inside the hospital”.“We commit to that fixed price. Any benefit beyond that we share with the customer in some way. Any underperformance we have to absorb,” says Mr Ishrak.Express Scripts is also using its trove of big data – it has claims records for 85m Americans – to guarantee that those patients deemed less likely to finish a course of treatment still take their medication.“We have predictive models that show us if a patient is going to be adherent to a drug before they even take their first dose,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer. “If you let us fill the prescription, we will guarantee adherence and will refund the cost of any ‘wasted’ drugs.”Several of the companies that are developing expensive immunotherapy cancer drugs, which encourage a patient’s white blood cells to attack their tumours, are also developing diagnostic tests to ensure the treatment is only given to those who are likely to benefit.That would enable them to charge high prices but cut the overall cost to the healthcare system by reducing wastage.Genentech, for example, has a companion diagnostic test that determines whether a patient has the right “biomarker” to respond to a drug it is developing to treat bladder cancer."
12;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Medtronic: the tax inversion that got away;Medical technology group says $49.9bn takeover is not just about tax;It was the tax inversion that got away. Medtronic, one of the world’s biggest medical technology companies, has completed its $49.9bn takeover of Ireland-based Covidien, and shares in the combined company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.It is one of just a handful of deals to have survived a White House crackdown on inversions, in which companies slash their tax bills by acquiring a foreign company and redomiciling overseas. Other big transactions, most notably AbbVie’s £32bn takeover of Shire, collapsed after the US Treasury rewrote the rules.Omar Ishrak, the Bangladesh-born chairman and chief executive of Medtronic, says that buying Covidien was as much about corporate strategy as tax: “We just followed the rules and the deal was done based on strategic merits. So that’s why it’s more resilient to some of the obvious things that the Treasury did.”The combined company, with a market capitalisation of about $125bn, will be one of the biggest players in the fragmented “medtech” sector, manufacturing everything from standard pacemakers to precision tools and imaging devices for neurosurgeons.While Mr Ishrak talks up the strategic merits of the deal, he acknowledges the company will get various tax benefits by inverting, shaving between 1 and 2 percentage points off its 18 per cent tax rate.More importantly, it will provide Medtronic with much-needed cash to meet its pledge to return half of free cash flow to investors. Mr Ishrak says that, following the deal, the combined company will be able to utilise about 60 per cent of its free cash flow.Previously, Minnesota-based Medtronic could only access about 35 per cent of its free cash flow, with the rest adding to a $14bn cash pile that is trapped overseas. If it had tried to repatriate these funds to the US, it would have had to hand about a third to the taxman, so it resorted to raising debt to fund shareholder dividends and buybacks. “Borrowing money to achieve that was not sustainable in the long term,” says Mr Ishrak.Initially, Medtronic had intended to use its overseas cash pile to help finance the takeover of Covidien, although that plan fell foul of the US Treasury’s rule changes. Instead, in December it tapped the bond markets for $17bn — the biggest corporate debt sale of 2014 — at what Mr Oshrak describes as “a very favourable interest rate” of 3.6 per cent.Inverting has not solved the problem of all that cash trapped overseas, however, which will remain largely inaccessible unless distant prospects for US tax reform start to improve. “Our return on investment capital gets hit by that. But at the end of the day, from an overall value creation perspective, the strength of the operational benefits . . . far outweigh that penalty,” says Mr Ishrak.He says the trapped cash could be used to fund more acquisitions, although “deals like this don’t happen often enough for me to say there’s another 15 of them waiting around”. Before attempting any more big M&A, Mr Ishrak says the company will need to prove it can integrate Covidien.“Our IT systems, our corporate capabilities — all will be stretched in having to do something as big as this and we need to understand for ourselves what our management bandwidth is. There’s a limit to everything,” he says.Our return on investment capital gets hit by that. But at the end of the day, from an overall value creation perspective, the strength of the operational benefits . . . far outweigh that penaltyThere is also a limit to the number of smaller deals Medtronic can do, says Mr Ishraf. “To some degree we can come up with strategic development opportunities, but doing $14bn of ‘bolt-ons’ is not very viable,” he says.As for cutting costs, Mr Ishraf identifies several areas where the company could reduce spending, including downsizing some of its corporate offices and regional headquarters. However, he is adamant that he will take a “thoughtful approach towards consolidation . . . which protects any customer-facing activity from any disruption at all.”Mr Ishrak says the takeover of Covidien has much to offer aside from financial engineering. He singles out the development of a novel drug-coated balloon for opening up the arteries of patients with peripheral artery disease — a common condition that causes leg pain and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Both companies were working on competing balloons, but Medtronic’s device was more advanced and received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this month. Covidien had a superior distribution channel, however, and now the product will get to market more quickly, according to Mr Ishrak. The deal will also expand the company’s geographic footprint, he says.The larger company will also have more bargaining power with hospitals and other buyers in a highly competitive industry which is dominated by smaller single-product suppliers that can use aggressive price cuts to win market share.One of the ways Medtronic can fight back, says Mr Ishrak, is by using its much wider range of products to build tailor-made solutions for doctors and surgeons.Ultimately, however, Mr Ishrak believes the healthcare system will move from a “fee per service” system, where Medtronic and others charge a fixed price for a product, to a “value-based” system, where medical companies are paid based on outcomes.In the example of the drug-coated balloon, for instance, Medtronic might be reimbursed according to how many heart attacks it prevents.
13;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Bears tighten their grip as one-way bets disappear;Corporate bond yields rise as clouds descend on equity markets;More than $21bn of new deals came to the US investment grade debt market on the first day of December, led by a $17bn offer from medical device maker Medtronic. It was the second largest primary market session ever, according to the LCD unit of Standard & Poor’s.Things were not quite as robust in the high yield market, though, as some deals, especially in the energy sector, were postponed indefinitely and spreads widened in the secondary market. “Plenty of bonds were still trading furiously out of the energy space amid a confluence of short covering and cherry picking by intrepid investors,” noted LCD. Bond prices hovered at a 29-month low.Credit, especially in the junk market, has underperformed in recent weeks even as shares hit record levels. Moreover, it is hard to see an improvement in the credit market any time soon. So, as end-of-year reports start pouring in from the brokerage and investment firms, the pressing question is whether credit market gloom will infect stocks or whether factors weighing on credit will instead prove passing and the two markets will move happily in tandem once more.But at least the debate is no longer just about second guessing the Federal Reserve and its monetary policy. There is general agreement that while the Fed has stopped its asset purchases, it will not raise rates any time soon. Most analysts think interest rates will remain negative in real terms for years to come. Indeed, some macro bears are already beginning to ask whether the Fed has exited its asset purchase programme too early.For some investors, the drama now unfolding in the junk bond market is a replay of events 15 years ago. At that time TMT — primarily telecoms — doubled as a portion of most indices, spreads widened and defaults spiked. Any time any single sector grows at that rate, it is a warning sign. Energy has done exactly that and now accounts for about 16 per cent of the index. But energy is not the only sector that has attracted concern. Prospects for mining and mineral companies (another 5 per cent) are also looking much less bright, as are some retailers and — how could it be otherwise — the overleveraged buyouts of the boom period. The spread between higher quality double B names and lower quality triple C names widened from 250 basis points in July to 400 bps in early December, Goldman Sachs notes.Many believe that far too much easy money has driven up asset prices to the point of asymmetry, and that there is far more downside than upside now. For these investors it is 2007. At Guggenheim Partners, for example, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer, spends a lot of his time looking at an internal rating system calculating the degree of overvaluation across sectors. While spreads have widened, by historical standards, they are still relatively tight. Moreover, by some metrics, the leverage is even higher now than back then.There are fresh concerns as well. There is a lot of hidden leverage in things like exchange traded funds. Many private banks lend to investors in ETFs, so while the products themselves may not be levered, their holders are. Retail cash flows to US high yield funds have turned deeply negative, with a net $859m of redemptions in the week ended December 3, according to Lipper, of which ETFs accounted for 32 per cent of the outflow, or roughly $279m.Additionally, there are the well-broadcast fears of “the illusion of liquidity”. The New York Fed puts dealers’ positions in the credit market at $61bn, which means the holdings of the five largest investor groups is now 138 times that of the dealers, according to research from Citigroup.Some say any correction should be regarded as a buying opportunity. Others say flows that no longer go into credit will surely flow into the equity market instead in an almost zero rate world, although there are clouds there too, especially as a strong dollar means translation losses on overseas earnings.So the safest observation is that markets will no longer move in one direction. “With more limited opportunities for broad-based tightening, heightened volatility will create the biggest challenges and opportunities in 2015,” note analysts at Barclays Capital.For many years, shorts have been killed. But looking ahead, it is likely that the bears will cast an effective shadow for the first time in a while.henny.sender@ft.com
14;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-12-01T18:29:35Z;Lower US bond yields spur corporate debt sales;Treasury yield drop cushions against more demanding investors;US companies were preparing a slew of debt sales on Monday, with lower Treasury yields spurring activity and offsetting demands by investors for greater price concessions.With capital markets activity expected to slow after the middle of the month, the US debt deal calendar is seen as remaining strong for the next two weeks, extending a flurry of issuance that has pushed risk premiums wider and raised company borrowing costs.However, the drop in Treasury yields has cushioned issuers against expectations of higher risk premiums for pending deals. The US 10-year note yield was below 2.2 per cent on Monday, and has dropped from near 2.4 per cent in three weeks on the back of deflation fears in Europe and slowing growth in China and Japan.That global backdrop is seen as supporting debt issuance by US companies, which are looking to lock in borrowing costs at levels that are still relatively low before the end of the year. Wall Street syndicate desks are keen to complete debt sales before the calendar closes for the year.“Bankers want to push deals and issuers are looking to take advantage of lower yields,” said Michael Kastner, managing principal at Halyard Asset Management. He expected a flurry of deals before the middle of December, though investors had become more discerning about credit risk, he said.“Corporate deals are not getting done as easily as they were a couple of months ago. Investors are a little more selective on credit at the moment.”Among companies looking to tap capital markets at the start of the month on Monday were the likes of Medtronic, with the expected sale of at least $10bn in bonds as the medical device maker seeks to finance its $43bn purchase of Covidien.Benchmark offerings from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Cox Communications were also expected, while Moody’s placed Amazon on negative outlook ahead of a likely sale of senior unsecured notes.Edward Marrinan, head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities, said the bond market expected investment-grade debt supply of $53bn, driven largely by merger and acquisition transactions announced earlier in the year.“With two full weeks in December, issuers are expected to front-load issuance,” said Mr Marrinan. “The general concerns about global growth, the decline in oil prices and disinflation are not deterring corporate borrowers.”
15;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-10-16T17:31:36Z;Tax changes roil inversion deals;Collapse of AbbVie-Shire does not herald the end;The sudden collapse of AbbVie’s proposed $54bn takeover of rival drugmaker Shire does not necessarily signal that the Obama administration has killed tax-driven deals.Instead, it underlines how a White House crackdown is splintering US companies that are planning so-called inversion deals into different groups, legal and tax experts say.Some companies are calling off inversions, which enable US companies to cut their American tax bills by moving their legal address overseas. Others are restructuring their financing to keep them alive, and some are proceeding unimpeded.Reflecting that reality, the White House is not celebrating AbbVie’s decision to abandon the deal with Shire. “What the Treasury’s done [with its anti-inversion measures] reduces some of the economic benefits of inversions,” an administration official said on Thursday.The official added: “As a result, some of the inversions that would have happened won’t happen. And some that happen will be less rewarding to those involved. But it doesn’t change the basic fact that you can buy a company much smaller than yourselves overseas and change your tax address to the address of that company, while still essentially not changing anything else.”The most potent anti-inversion measures the Obama administration announced on September 22 made it harder for inverted companies to achieve one of their principal goals: accessing earnings parked outside the US without paying American tax on them.AbbVie – which says a “significant portion” of its $10.2bn cash pile is offshore – is the biggest group to have a deal scuttled by the change, but not the first. Earlier this month, Salix said it was pulling out of its planned $2.7bn acquisition of an Irish subsidiary of Cosmo, which would have allowed it to move its tax home to Dublin.The three week delay between Treasury’s move and AbbVie’s decision to call off the Shire deal highlights the complexity of the US tax situation. Companies are also uncertain about how they might be affected by a promised second round of US measures that are expected to attack the way inverted companies use loans between head office and US subsidiaries to cut their taxes.While tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky, says Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingOne top ten investor in AbbVie said: “There are a number of deals pending. If they all go through, then this would be a big year for tax inversions. I doubt it will be a big year now.”Medtronic chose a different response to the White House crackdown. Rather than scrap its planned $43bn acquisition of Ireland-based Covidien, the US medical devices maker restructured its financing. The group had planned to use overseas cash belonging to itself and Covidien to help pay for the deal. But once the White House shut off tax-free access to that money, it instead opted to borrow $16bn of alternative – and more expensive – financing.Further proof that the inversion bandwagon is still running came this week when Steris Corp, a medical equipment maker, launched a $1.9bn cash-and-share takeover of the UK’s Synergy Healthcare. It was the first deal of this type since the White House’s move.Some companies that were considering inversions are exploring alternative means to access their offshore cash.One option would be to sell the group to a large foreign rival. That is a possibility for Chiquita Brands, a US banana company, whose planned $1.3bn merger with Dublin-based Fyffes is being challenged by a rival offer from Brazil’s Cutrale and Safra families.Tax lawyers said the Brazilian moves points to one side-effect of the Obama administration’s measures. The US company’s offshore cash has become cheaper to access through an acquisition by a foreign rival than if the US company did an inversion. Along those lines, Salix, the group that scrapped its inversion, has been proposed as a potential target for Actavis, which already has its tax domicile in Ireland.One large hedge fund investor in the pharmaceutical sector said that if the US eventually slams the door fully shut on inversions, it will give non-US companies – especially those created by inversions – a permanent advantage over their US rivals. “For instance, they [will] have more firepower to a deal for an orphan disease drugmaker than a company that doesn’t have their tax structure,” he said.The Obama administration official said closing the door would require changing the law to limit inversions to groups where the former shareholders of the US company owned less than 50 per cent of the new combined entity, as opposed to less than 80 per cent as it requires now.“We just need to change the threshold to 50 per cent so you can’t buy a company smaller than yourself and change your tax address – and that would require an act of Congress and that would basically end this practice,” he said.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and David Oakley in London
16;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;US warned of up to 25 groups eyeing foreign switch to cut tax;Senators attack the ‘fast-buck artists’ encouraging deals;Up to 25 more US companies are considering relocating overseas to cut their tax bills this year, a Democratic senator has warned, as he assailed investment bankers for encouraging the idea.The prediction came as concern mounts in Washington over a rise in merger deals, known as inversions, which US multinationals use to move their headquarters to countries with lower corporate tax rates.They were thrust into the spotlight by Pfizer’s $116bn attempt to buy UK rival AstraZeneca. Angst is now rising over Walgreens, a drugstore chain that could use its agreed takeover of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots to redomicile.Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate finance committee, intensified his attacks on inversions on Tuesday. “The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days,” he said. “How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?”He complained that even as they hurt US employment and shrank the country’s tax base, the deals were being promoted by “fast-buck artists” such as investment bankers, private equity groups, lawyers and accountants.“With the investment bankers in that inversion feeding frenzy, there may be 25 more inversions during [this year],” he told a hearing of the Senate finance committee.In inversion deals in the past month, Medtronic announced the $42.9bn acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien and AbbVie agreed to take over the UK’s Shire for $54bn.Speaking for the Obama administration, Robert Stack, an official at the US Treasury, told the hearing: “We are aware of many more inversions in the works right now”.Companies and their advisers on both sides of the Atlantic remain undaunted by the political onslaught in Washington, calculating that the chances of Congress passing bipartisan legislation to curb inversions are slim.Last week, Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers to pass a White House proposal – backed by Mr Wyden – to stamp out inversions, which would lift the foreign ownership threshold for such deals from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.Although senior Republicans have also lambasted inversions, the two parties cannot agree on how to tackle the problem.Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican senator on the finance committee, criticised proposed countermeasures from the White House and others as being mainly “punitive and retroactive”. He said that rather than “incentivising American companies to remain in the US, these bills would build walls around US corporations in order to keep them from inverting”.The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days. How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?He added that they could have the unintended consequence of encouraging “reverse acquisition” inversions by making US companies more attractive targets for foreign suitors.Chris Krueger, an independent analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said the probability of Congress taking action on inversions this year was less than 10 per cent.Politicians will go on a five-week recess next week and when they return minds will be focused on November elections.In a statement echoed by many Republicans, the Business Roundtable, which represents blue-chip companies, said last week that inversions were symptoms of failures of a US tax system that hampers US competitiveness.It said “piecemeal” bills to curb the deals were not the answer and repeated its longstanding calls for comprehensive tax reform.Mr Wyden said he had invited the chief executives of several companies doing inversions to testify, but they had not accepted.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Switch and you are on your own / From Mr Arnold Holtzman
17;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-07-14T09:41:38Z;AbbVie/Shire – join us at 12 for a live discussion;;The above is a clause from the Medtronic/Covidien merger agreement of course – although it allows Medtronic to walk away from the deal if US tax law prevents the company ‘inverting’ to Covidien’s Irish domicile.And we wonder whether a Shire recommendation of AbbVie’s £53.20 a share offer would eventually lead to a similar clause…The price is a 42 per cent premium to where Shire shares traded before AbbVie became involved (though after Pfizer’s bid for AstraZeneca made clear that tax inversions were about to become a rather big theme in drug M&A).Are inversions really so stable a motive for M&A, if clauses like the above show the legal risk? And post-Shire, what’s left for an inverter to buy anyway?We’ll be doing our first open note (in which we post data and ideas, and you get to comment) on these topics at 12pm London time. See you there.
18;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-29T21:21:55Z;Value of M&A hits $1.7tn in first six months of 2014;;Deal frenzy, animal spirits, merger mania – call it what you like, it is back. The value of global mergers and acquisitions hit $1.75tn in the first six months of the year, a 75 per cent rise on the same period last year and the highest since 2007.The increase highlights a shift in thinking in the US, Europe and Asia. Risk aversion and organic expansion, embraced after the financial crisis, are being pushed aside as the belief returns that growth can be more easily bought than built.The value of M&A soared on all three continents during the six months as companies, many flush with cash, took on transactions with vigour.In the US, M&A announced in the year to date stands at $748.5bn, up almost three-quarters on a year earlier. In Asia-Pacific, deals hit $327.8bn, up 85 per cent and the best year-to-date period for dealmaking in the region since Thomson Reuters began recording the data in 1980. In Europe, M&A is back with a bang: the $509bn of deals announced mark a more than doubling over 2013 levels.Peter Tague, co-head of Global M&A at Citi, said companies had started to accept that “the volatile world we are in is the new normal – there is always going to be an Iraq or a sovereign debt wobble about to happen somewhere. Increasingly, they are deciding they have to deliver in that environment against a growth imperative that cannot be sustained through cost-cutting and organic activity alone. That leaves us feeling pretty good about the prospects for M&A.”The rebound has spread across most sectors except financials, where tougher regulation has suppressed appetite. “Availability of debt and low cost of financing are enablers of M&A, but deals remain driven by strategic logic,” Gilberto Pozzi, head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said.Much activity has been in health­care, with the value of deals reaching $317.4bn in the first six months, the highest recorded and 15 per cent above 2007’s full-year record of $275bn. Many deals have been worth over $10bn, including Med­tro­nic’s $48bn acquisition of Covi­dien and Valeant’s $62.5bn pursuit of Allergan. The industry would have had an even more remarkable start had Pfizer and AstraZeneca agreed terms.“The bigger deals have emerged from growing confidence in the boardroom,” Robert Rankin, co-head of corporate banking and securities at Deutsche Bank, said. “A lot of these transactions have been considered for a long time, but the courage to execute them has only returned in the last 12 months.”
19;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-17T08:12:42Z;Strong sales send Whitbread higher;;The FTSE 100 made gains in opening trade on Tuesday, amid a tentative return to risk across European equities markets led in London by financial and consumer stocks.Shares in Whitbread are among the best gainers on the index, up 3.5 per cent at £43.15 after strong sales numbers from its Costa Coffee cafés and Premier Inn chain of budget hotels.JD Sports, the leisure clothing retailer, is 1.5 per cent higher at £16.79. It said the World Cup had “enhanced the trading performance of our most significant segment”.Further M&A speculation in the drugs sector also helped the mood. Reuters reported that Shire had hired Citi to advise it on defending itself against any potential bid. The stock is up 3.1 per cent at £36.43.The report follows a spate of dealmaking in the sector, including the unsuccessful $40bn offer from Pfizer of the US for AstraZeneca and the proposed $50bn merger of Ireland’s Coiven with American medical device company Medtronic.Heavily weighted mining stocks limited the overall rise, held back by weaker metals prices on commodities markets. Anglo American is down 1.4 per cent at £14.02, while BHP Billiton is 1 per cent weaker at £18.45.Precious metals stocks also fell as the haven appeal of gold and silver waned. Randgold Resources is the biggest faller on the main London index, down 2.1 per cent at £45.20. Fresnillo, the world’s biggest silver miner, is down 2 per cent at 804.6p.Overall, the main London index is up 0.1 per cent at 6,762.47, setting it on course for its first gain in two sessions.Crest Nicholson is the top stock on the FTSE 250 after the housebuilder reported a 26 per cent jump in first-half revenues of £241.1m, helped by a focus on the fast-growing housing market in the South of England. Its shares are up 3.2 per cent at 335.4p.There was an eye-catching slide for Xaar, a mid-cap maker of printing equipment, which issued revenue guidance for 2014 under the level expected by analysts. Its stock is down 22 per cent at 576p.
20;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-16T18:14:56Z;Medical device makers in a race to merge;;Medical device companies are eyeing more consolidation after Medtronic agreed to buy Covidien in a $42.9bn deal that highlights pressure on the industry to increase scale and efficiency.The deal was the latest example of a US company acquiring an overseas competitor to lower its corporate tax burden – in this case through Medtronic moving its headquarters to Ireland, where Covidien is based.However, analysts said tax savings were only part of the motivation for a deal that showed how this year’s rush of acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry has begun to spread to medical device companies.“A lot of people are trying to turn this into a tax inversion story,” said Joanne Wuensch, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, referring to the practice of using an acquisition to move a company’s tax domicile offshore. “But most of it is being driven by [the need for] product breadth.”Medical device companies have found their margins under pressure from changes in the US healthcare system – including the introduction of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Healthcare Act– and Ms Wuensch said this would lead to more deals.“What we may now be seeing is a race to reach a critical mass and not be left behind, so it’s not just a trend of big company buying smaller company, this seems to be the beginning of larger-scale consolidation.”According to Standard & Poor’s, the Medtronic deal would be the largest foreign acquisition by a US company when $5bn of assumed liabilities are added to the $42.9bn of cash and stock being offered to Covidien shareholders.Medtronic is the world’s largest standalone maker of medical devices, ranging from spinal implants to insulin pumps, with a market value of about $60bn.If completed, its acquisition of Covidien, a maker of devices used in surgical procedures, would create a close rival to Johnson & Johnson, the market leader.“It would create the ultimate buffet table of medical device products, producing a very large one-stop shop for discussions with hospital administrators,” said Ms Wuensch. “For those [companies] not yet participating, we would expect more [deals] to come.”The Medtronic deal is the second big takeover in the sector this year after the $13bn acquisition of Biomet by Zimmer in April to create the world’s biggest maker of hip and knee implants.Stryker, another US device maker, last month confirmed it had been evaluating a bid for Smith & Nephew, its UK-based rival, but had decided against it – at least for now.The news release did not mention tax benefits. The fact that the combined company would be Irish came two-thirds of the way through. Promises were made about protecting research spending. The message: this is not Pfizer-AstraZeneca.Continue reading“If you look at medtech, it is where the pharma sector was 15 years ago,” said one healthcare banker, referring to the wave of big deals that have convulsed the drugs industry over that period.US health policy reforms are leading to structural shifts in the way companies present their products to consolidated hospital chains, which are becoming dominant in their position as buyers of devices, according to analysts.The Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is among the factors increasing price pressure on device makers as the government, insurers and healthcare providers try to increase efficiency as millions more patients are brought into the US health system.“Medtech M&A in the near term seems to be shifting toward megadeals,” said Danielle Antalffy, analyst at Leerink. “Scale and portfolio breadth are increasingly being viewed . . . as paramount to remaining competitive.”She added: “This deal will inevitably fuel the question as to who’s next.”
21;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-16T17:19:57Z;Yahoo suffers setback on concerns about Alibaba float;Deals activity dominates S&P 500 movements;Shares in Yahoo were dealt a setback on Monday after Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba reported a slowdown in fourth-quarter sales growth and shrinking profit margins.Yahoo holds a 24 per cent stake in Alibaba, which is marked for a potential $20bn listing in New York. If the offering is completed, it would represent one of the largest initial public offerings in history.Some analysts on Wall Street have speculated the company could be valued at as much as $200bn.The potential effect on its valuation as a consequence of the latest results pinned back Yahoo shares 6 per cent to $34.81, after a recent rally on high expectations.Merger activity also dominated Monday trading. Shares in Medtronic, the medical device maker, fell 1.1 per cent to $60.03 after it agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc for $42.9bn. Shares in Covidien were up 20 per cent to $86.75.Williams Companies shares also climbed 19 per cent to $56.02, providing another large lift to the S&P 500. The pipeline operator has agreed to acquire control of Access Midstream Partners LP for $5.99bn.Level 3 Communications lost 4 per cent after it said it would buy Internet services provider TW Telecom for $40.86 per share in a cash and stock deal. TW Telecom gained 7 per cent to $38.85.In further deals-related moves, Fusion-io surged 22 per cent to $11.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $1.2bn, after agreeing to be acquired by SanDisk for just under that amount.SanDisk is a veteran manufacturer of flash storage and Fusion-io is something of a young upstart -developing flash technology that gives faster performance than conventional hard drives when used by computers in network data centres.Its chief scientist, however, is a household name – Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.SanDisk is offering $11.25 for each Fusion-io share and the $1.1bn deal, which is net of cash assumed, is expected to close in the third quarter.SanDisk shares rose 4 per cent to $102.00 by close on Monday, valuing the company at $23bn.Sanjay Mehrotra, SanDisk president and chief executive officer, said Fusion-io would accelerate its efforts “to enable the flash-transformed data centre, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership”.Shares in Vertex Pharmaceuticals fell 9 per cent to $67.12 on concerns about the company’s experimental drug to treat cystic fibrosis, VX809. Monday’s decline puts the stock down 16 per cent from year ago levels.Wells Fargo senior analyst Brian Abrahams said that the weakness was “based on revisited concerns about risk” going into forthcoming readouts on the drug, known as Lumacaftor, and “some caution apparently being expressed by scientists at the ongoing European Cystic Fibrosis Society conference in Sweden”.“We note these concerns are not new, and experts at our CF symposium earlier this year noted there are many variables that make it difficult to draw conclusions based solely on this,” Mr Abrahams said in a note.However, analysts at Bernstein said after attending the conference that the “probability of failure is high, and is under-appreciated by the investment community.”“More than ever there seems to be a disconnect between the assumptions and expectations of the investor community and that of the medical community involved in the trial,” said Geoffrey Porges, putting a $65 target price on the stock.Overall, US equities started the week little changed, despite better than expected industrial production, regional manufacturing and homebuilder sentiment data.“Today’s figures are evidence of a strengthening recovery of the economy,” said Chris Rupkey, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist. “Fed policy is behind the curve if industrial production was the one desert-island statistic on the Fed’s dashboard guiding monetary policy.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 5 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 16,781.01, the S&P 500 lost 2 points to 1,937.78 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.24 per cent to 4,321.11.
22;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-16T10:42:57Z;Medtronic / Covidien: tax and save;Similar motivation as Pfizer / AstraZeneca deal but better reputation;"The news release did not mention tax benefits. The fact that the combined company would be Irish came two-thirds of the way through. Promises were made about protecting research spending. The message: this is not Pfizer-AstraZeneca.Medtronic says its proposed $47bn acquisition of Covidien, an Ireland-based medical devices maker, will create innovation, globalisation and efficiency. Pfizer’s pitch was similar, but the innovation leg was not convincing. The recent history of the pharma industry is full of M&A, and innovation has not benefited. Does merging big medical device groups, by contrast, spur innovation? Why would it?The notion the combined company will have greater global reach is wobbly, too. The companies’ sales mixes are similar: half in the US, a quarter in Europe, the rest mostly Asia. Both groups are global already.And so to efficiency. Medtronic is paying a $9.7bn premium for Covidien. The $850m in expected annual cost savings has a value of, say, $7bn taxed and capitalised. How to fill the gap? In Pfizer’s case, taxes did the work. But Medtronic’s tax rate is only one or two percentage points higher than Covidien’s. The difference might be worth $1bn, at a stretch. The freedom to move cash around the world without worrying too much about tax has a value, too, but is impossible to quantify.So the difference between the two deals is one of degree only. The tax benefits matter less in Medtronic’s case. And research budgets – and as such the perceived risk to the public good posed by a merger – are lower in devices than drugs. Yet Medtronic has an agreed deal and Pfizer was sent packing. The reason is history. Pfizer dragged behind it a reputation as a ruthless buyer and cutter. It shut down its biggest UK facility, in Sandwich, just a few years ago. Money talks; reputation and emotion shout.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"
23;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-16T02:16:41Z;Medtronic snaps up Covidien for $42.9bn;;"Medtronic, the medical device and equipment maker, has agreed to acquire Irish rival Covidien’s equity in a $42.9bn cash and stock deal that will allow the US company to shift its tax base overseas to avoid higher corporate tax rates.Medtronic, which has a market value of $60.5bn, will pay Covidien shareholders $93.22 a share. That represents a premium of 50 per cent over Friday’s closing stock price of $60.70, marking the largest agreed deal in the healthcare sector so far this year.The acquisition, announced late on Sunday night, also underscores the upheaval taking place in the global pharmaceuticals industry.Omar Ishrak, chairman and chief executive of Medtronic, said the combined group would hold market-leading positions in neurovascular technologies for treating Parkinson’s disease and strokes, and would have annual combined sales of $27bn.The deal will enable Medtronic to shift its tax base away from the US in a move known as an inversion, whereby it will assume the lower-tax domicile of Covidien.However, Mr Ishrak played down the tax benefits of the deal to his company.“This transaction is strategic first; the financial structure and optimisation of tax discussion came after. The tax rates for Medtronic do not change a significant amount, but the structure gives us access to the cash generated by Covidien assets abroad which we can then reinvest into US technologies,” Mr Ishrak told the Financial Times.The deal, which has been in the works since early April, comes amid a slew of friendly and hostile mergers and acquisitions activity in the healthcare industry since the start of the year.As well as Pfizer’s abortive $116bn attempt to take over UK rival AstraZeneca, there have been deals between Zimmer and Biomet, and Novartis and GSK. In the US, Valeant is pursuing Allergan, the Botox-maker, for $53bn.Even before the Medtronic acquisition the value of deals in the healthcare industry had passed $160bn in 2014 – up almost 50 per cent from last year and more than three times that of 2012, according to Dealogic.The news release did not mention tax benefits. The fact that the combined company would be Irish came two-thirds of the way through. Promises were made about protecting research spending. The message: this is not Pfizer-AstraZeneca.Continue readingThe common thread running through much of the M&A in the sector is a desire to complete a tax inversion to secure a lower tax rate.To qualify for the inversion, at least 20 per of the shares in the combined company must be held outside the US, but the benefits are huge to American companies, which have among the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Covidien is itself formally a US company and still has most of its operations based in Massachusetts. But the business relocated its headquarters to Ireland five years ago and has taken advantage of the country’s 12.5 per cent tax rate.As of Friday’s market close the company, which was created in 2007 by being spun off from Tyco International, had a market capitalisation of $32.5bn. Medtronic had a market capitalisation of $60.5bn.José Almeida, Covidien’s chief executive, told the FT he would step down once the deal is completed.Medtronic was advised by Perella Weinberg while Covidien was advised by Goldman Sachs."
24;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Medtronic set to acquire rival medical device maker Covidien;;Medtronic, the medical device company, is set to merge with rival Covidien in a deal valued at close to $50bn that marks the latest example of a US company using a merger to move its tax domicile abroad to shelter it from the country’s corporate tax rates.A deal valued at between $45bn and $50bn could be announced as soon as Monday, according to people familiar with the talks, but one person cautioned that a deal may still fall apart.A merger with Ireland-based Covidien would allow Medtronic to take advantage of a so-called tax inversion by moving its headquarters to a European country, which has lower tax rate than the US.As of Friday’s close, Covidien had a market capitalisation of $32.5bn. It became a publicly traded company in 2007 after it was spun off from Tyco International. Medtronic had a market capitalisation of $60.5bn.To qualify for the inversion, at least 20 per of the shares in the combined company would need to be held outside the US, meaning Medtronic, which makes pacemakers and spine implants, would need to fund a large proportion of any bid with its own stock.Medtronic had been rumoured to be evaluating inversion options in recent weeks after it emerged that its US rival Stryker had been preparing a bid for UK-based Smith & Nephew. Another US rival Zimmer, the maker of joint replacement technology, acquired Biomet in a blockbuster deal worth $13.4bn.The pharmaceutical, medical device and healthcare sector has been rife with deals and deal talks as companies race to take advantage of inversions amid fear that the window to strike such deals could close if the US Congress takes action to reform US tax laws.The companies could not be immediately reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
25;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-12T22:26:52Z;Taxing time ahead as offshore rules come under more scrutiny;;The OECD called it “ the golden age” of tax planning: a period in which multinational companies pushed ever more of their profits offshore and pushed their effective tax rates down.In the past eight years, this simple strategy has enabled some of the largest US corporations – including Oracle, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson – to cut their tax bills by a quarter, on average – while boosting their annual earnings by up to 24 per cent.But there are signs that both politicians and investors are increasingly questioning the merits of a tax regime that has made such savings possible.Earlier this week, the joint committee on taxation, which advises the US Congress, warned that American companies were incurring extra costs from keeping their profits outside the US. It cited research showing a “ballooning” of company balance sheets, as multinationals chose to borrow more for spending purposes, rather than repatriate their offshore cash and pay US tax on it.Investors are also starting to worry that the positive effect of tax-cutting strategies on companies’ earnings could go into reverse. Earlier this month, Luca Paolini, chief strategist of Pictet Asset Management, warned investors against complacency by pointing out that a quarter of international companies’ improvement in net margins had been achieved only by reducing their tax bills.Many technology and pharmaceuticals companies have been at the forefront of a 15-year push by US multinationals to earn more of their profits in tax havens and in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Singapore.To measure this, the Financial Times reviewed the accounts of 14 cash-rich tech and pharmaceuticals companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Amgen, EMC, eBay, Eli Lilly and Medtronic.Between them, the 14 held $479bn-worth of cash and similar assets offshore – a little more than half of the $947bn of total offshore cash that Moody’s estimated was held by US non-financial companies at the end of 2013.By doing so, the 14 companies surveyed cut their tax rates by an average of 7.7 percentage points between 2004-06 and 2011-13. In the most recent period, they were, on average, taxed at a rate of just 10 per cent, down from 11 per cent in 2004-06. By comparison, average OECD corporate tax rates fell 3.4 points to 25.15 per cent over that timescale.A little more than 85 per cent of this average tax reduction could be attributed to the companies’ fast expanding foreign operations.Many of the companies point out that these apparently low foreign tax rates are not the full story. Investors, they say, are fully aware that they owe extra tax to the US – at a rate of up to 35 per cent – on any foreign earnings when they are brought back to the US.They are exempt only from reporting the “deferred” tax charge – reflecting the money they will ultimately have to pay the US – in their accounts for as long as they can prove the profits are being indefinitely reinvested abroad. And a company’s decision to indefinitely reinvest its cash overseas can be reversed, resulting in big increases in the reported tax rates. For example, eBay recently surprised the market by reporting a $2.3bn loss after recording a $3bn deferred tax liability, saying that it needed the “flexibility” to use foreign cash for US dealmaking.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals company, also bucked the trend of falling tax rates, after a 2011 change in its accounting treatment. It has provided for $6.6bn of deferred tax – nearly two-thirds of its total tax bill over the past three years. It was the only company surveyed by the FT to report a tax rate above 25 per cent for 2011-13, except for Apple, which also reports “deferred” tax on some of its offshore earnings.Regulators are now pushing some cash-rich companies to disclose more details of their offshore cash. Google recently had to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to spend up to $30bn on foreign acquisitions and technology rights, after it was challenged to describe its “specific plans” for reinvesting undistributed earnings.In addition, the SEC has called on some companies to explain why their foreign profits are “disproportionate” to their foreign sales. On average, the companies surveyed by the FT reported two-thirds of their profits outside the US but only half their sales. This followed an eight-year period in which foreign profits grew at nearly three times the pace of foreign sales – a trend similar to one identified by Harry Grubert, senior economist at the US Treasury. He warned that “profits, not sales, are being globalised” after discovering a 14 percentage-point increase in foreign profits at multinationals, as a proportion of the total, between 1996 and 2004.Last year, the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, warned that the process was continuing as US companies moved more profits out of high tax countries, including the US, into “tax preferred” countries, such as Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.Some companies argue that relatively higher profit margins outside the US are to be expected, given the heavy research and development costs they incur in their home country, the cost of servicing US debt, the cost of their corporate headquarters and, in some cases, US litigation costs.David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes and assistant treasurer of Eli Lilly, says that it is “unremarkable” that the company’s reinvested earnings had more than doubled in a period when sales growth had only nearly doubled. “This doubling should be expected of a company that is growing throughout the world, especially in non-US markets,” he argues.Oracle, Johnson & Johnson and EMC declined to comment. Pfizer, Cisco, Qualcomm, Merck, Amgen and Medtronic did not respond to request for comment. Google made no formal comment and eBay said that it complied with all international tax rules. Microsoft and Apple referred to past statements in which they said that they abided by US and foreign tax laws – but believed they should be improved.‘Book tax’ more important than cash kindUS companies invest about 55 per cent of their near $2tn of foreign earnings in productive assets, such as factories and offices, according to academic research. But some of them have told researchers that they would bring more of this cash back to the US if they were not deterred by the prospect of high tax bills.Companies also say that the accounting rules create an incentive for them to designate their offshore earnings as “permanently reinvested” abroad, as this spares them from the need to earmark money in their accounts to pay future US tax bills.Academic studies have even found that so called “book tax” – the tax bill that is reported in a company’s accounts, but may vary from the “cash tax” amount that is actually paid – can influence share prices, executive bonuses and competitor analysis.Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California says: “Book tax is extremely important. It is the filter through which we see companies. It dominates corporate behaviour much more than cash taxes do.”Michelle Hanlon, a professor at MIT, says that her research shows that moving offshore and retaining cash there is at least in part driven by “the accounting for taxes that shows up on the financial accounting statements”, in addition to the real financial impact.
26;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2014-06-05T16:53:24Z;Smith & Nephew jumps on takeover speculation;Sterling’s strength holds back wider UK equities market;Smith & Nephew remains the London market’s favourite gambling chip.The orthopaedic device maker spiked on Thursday, rising as much as 6.8 per cent to hit an intraday high, on a newswire report that US peer Medtronic was evaluating a takeover offer. Medtronic had already been widely rumoured to be considering its options after its compatriot Stryker said in May that it had paused work on an S&N bid.However, a lack of a statement from Medtronic was seen to indicate that its plans for an S&N bid had also been shelved.At an investor day, Medtronic management did not comment directly on S&N but emphasised its strategic focus was on unrelated areas such as spinal injuries.“Management indicated that while it’s interested in orthopaedics more broadly, it will only enter a new market if it feels it can be a top player and clearly S&N’s hip and knee business does not fit that criteria,” said Wells Fargo.Medtronic also played down theories it was looking at overseas deals as a tax dodge. While most of the Minneapolis-based group’s $14bn cash pile resides outside the US, management was confident of returning about half to shareholders over the next five years without requiring a tax inversion.S&N pared gains to close 2.3 per cent higher at £10.88 as more than four times the average daily volume changed hands. The stock has jumped 18 per cent since Stryker confirmed it had looked at bidding.Sterling’s strength held back the wider market, leaving the FTSE 100 down 5.14 points at 6,813.49. The fallers board was populated by dollar- and euro-earners such as Burberry, down 2.5 per cent to £14.95, Tui Travel, down 1.4 per cent to 404p, and Arm Holdings, off 2.3 per cent to 894p.Retailers dropped after a second profit warning in three months from Asos, the fashion website, which blamed margin pressure on the strength of the pound. Asos slumped 31 per cent to £31.20 while Boohoo.com, its recently floated rival, was down 9.1 per cent to 45p.Royal Mail fell 3.2 per cent to 498p after RBC cut forecasts to reflect poor parcels volumes. However, it argued that weak volumes were already priced into the stock and there was room for good news in Royal Mail’s quarterly update due next month.Among the risers, BG Group was up 1.4 per cent to £12.40 after analysts picked up on guidance from Petrobras on its Santos Basin prospect in Brazil.In its in-house magazine, Petrobras said production at the site was around six months ahead of schedule with flow rates reported to be exceptionally strong, which should translate into lower costs, according to Deutsche Bank. “This should provide investors with greater confidence that the long-held promise of Brazil’s vast pre-salt endowment is finally starting to be realised,” said the broker.Satellite operator Inmarsat gained 2.5 per cent to 736.5p on news it would roll out the first Europe-wide air passenger broadband network.The success of US peer Gogo, which generated $330m of revenue last year from in-flight broadband, demonstrated that the service worked and people were willing to pay for it, said Jefferies. And while the US market was competitive, Europe’s regulatory borders meant mobile providers looking to compete would face an “insurmountable barrier to entry for the time being”, it added.

Edwards’ shares rose just over 11 per cent to end at $81.08.Shares in Aspen Insurance Holdings rallied 11.25 per cent after rejecting a $3.2bn hostile bid by rival Endurance Specialty Holdings, dubbing it “ill-conceived” with “significant execution risk” and a “strategic mismatch”.Endurance launched the hostile bid after failing to secure a deal during private negotiations. The cash and stock bid represented a 21 per cent premium to the value of Aspen’s shares at the close of trading on Friday.Amid concerns about share sales by founders and key executives of technology groups ahead of the recent slide in the Nasdaq index, shares in Twitter added just over 2 per cent to close at $40.90 after the messaging site’s co-founders said they had no sales planned.Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, and Chief Executive Richard Costolo, said in an SEC filing that they did not plan to sell the company’s shares after post-IPO restrictions are lifted in May.After its worst week since the spring of 2012, the S&P 500 staunched its losses on Monday, closing up 0.82 per cent at 1,830.61, after falling 2.7 per cent last week.The Nasdaq, subject to the fiercest selling last week as investors dumped high-growth technology shares, ended 0.57 per cent higher at 4,022.69. The index sank 3.1 per cent last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.91 per cent higher at 16,173.24.Sentiment was buoyed on Monday after first-quarter profits at Citigroup beat estimates, as the bank set aside less money for bad loans.Retail sales figures for March also brightened the mood, after they recorded the biggest monthly rise since September 2012.Despite anxieties over the valuation of parts of the market, particularly biotechnology and technology shares, others expect the S&P 500 to ultimately add to the 30 per cent gain it clocked last year.“Our long-term market views hold. Equities remain attractive, bonds look expensive,” said David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.
28;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;More must be done to put ideas into practice;Eliminating old ways of working and providing incentives for new ones is critical in the push for better healthcare;"It is more than two years since AstraZeneca launched a medicine for people with heart problems. In the UK, the authorities judged Brilinta not only safe and effective but also good value for money. Yet its take-up within the UK’s National Health Service has been sluggish.“Out of the good intention to decentralise decision-making, payers are becoming more fragmented,” says Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical group.“That multiplies the number of times you have to explain the value of your product, with requests for more data and discounts. So much energy is spent arguing, rather than being invested in managing patients appropriately,” he adds.His frustration is a familiar refrain around the world: from innovators working to capitalise on the high-tech revolutions in genomics and electronics to others with just as great a capacity to improve patient outcomes by enhancing distribution systems, provision of primary care clinics or deploying staff better.The topic has become an increasing focus of discussions among international physicians, policy makers and practitioners, from the George Institute’s Big Change conference on sustainable healthcare in Oxford last month, to the World Innovation Summit for Health in Qatar this week.If the first challenge in healthcare is coming up with innovations with the potential to reduce disease and extend lives, the second is to implement them. The more complex the ideas and the larger the number of systems or countries targeted, the more difficult it is to bring them into effect.Commodities such as new drugs, vaccines, medical devices and diagnostic equipment are difficult enough to launch. Approaches to delivering healthcare more broadly – from safer surgical practices such as checklists to retraining and empowering staff – are still more likely to fall victim to ignorance, cultural differences and vested political, financial, institutional or professional interests.“The NHS is incredibly slow in taking up innovation. It is unacceptable,” says David Haslam, the new chairman of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), an innovative and much emulated initiative to advise the British health system on the use of new drugs. It is increasingly scrutinising broader treatments and public health programmes.Sometimes, transformative innovations do get widely adopted. In the latter half of the 20th century, six childhood vaccines that had done much to reduce infant mortality in richer countries were still hardly used in poor ones. It took a combination of leadership, political will and funding to create the Unicef-led Expanded Programme on Immunisation to spread the benefits globally.Since the start of the millennium, the UN-backed Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, which channels donor funding to purchase newer vaccines, has helped disseminate products launched in richer countries into poorer ones with a far shorter time lag, such as those which protect against HPV, the cause of cervical cancer.Last week, donors pledged more than $12bn to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, which has helped substantially reduce the infectious disease burden among the world’s poor through better access to proven tools, such as bednets and antiretroviral medicines. Its bulk purchases and pooled procurement mechanisms have a broader impact by stimulating new markets and boosting affordable access.“Reverse” and often “frugal” innovation from lower income countries is also appearing, rooted in the need for affordability and practicability. In the previous decade, GE Healthcare began developing low-cost, more portable and robust ultrasound devices and CT scanners in and for India and China. Since the financial crisis, it has found ready takers in richer countries too.“It’s gone from an initiative to being part of the business strategy,” says John Dineen, head of the division. “For a long time innovation was always geared towards the high end. Today, economic value propositions are just as important.“When we develop a product for an emerging market, we are finding twice the demand we expected, because of equal requests from the developed world.”Many innovations have come from emerging economies rather than being sparked by external catalysts. Indian generic drug companies have helped cut costs with low-cost manufacture and litigation to challenge patents.Discovery Health, an insurance company in South Africa, has developed a model since exported to the UK, the US and parts of Asia, which seeks to drive down claims by promoting better lifestyles with incentives such as lower premiums, and discounts on gym memberships.Innovation in health systems remains more complex, reflecting fierce national differences. Fresenius of Germany operates dialysis networks in hospitals across borders.Medtronic, like GE, supplies not only equipment but also management to help boost utilisation rates. A few private health groups operate hospitals in several countries. They are exceptions.Yet “task shifting” as a way to respond to severe shortages of doctors has proved important in Asia and Africa, and is increasingly being explored in richer countries: training less specialist health professionals – and even lay volunteers – to improve access to care.Information technology also has the potential to disrupt and accelerate medical innovation, partly because it taps into the willingness of consumers to pay out of pocket expenses, despite the approaches not always being evidence-based.“As smartphones expand, I believe we are on the verge of take-off,” says Thierry Zylberberg, general manager for healthcare at Orange, the mobile operator. His company offers services from secure patient data storage and remote monitoring to counterfeit medicine identification systems and sexual health information by phone, and texts to remind people to take medicines regularly.There are also growing non-profit efforts to stimulate, showcase and diffuse innovation. The Gates Foundation has triggered much publicity with its open source “reinvent the toilet” prize. Canada’s Grand Challenges has funded ideas from “diagnosing diapers” to breast cancer detecting smartphones.A gulf remains between good ideas and effective practice. A recent study by the International Centre for Social Franchising highlighted poor information sharing on many good existing healthcare ideas.It also noted that their quality and ability to reach those most in need was highly variable, and many were difficult to scale or replicate because of the importance of local context.Lord Ara Darzi, the former British health minister chairing this week’s Qatar summit, which he hopes to turn into the future “Davos of healthcare”, says: “Innovation is your survival tool, but the biggest challenge I had in the NHS was that innovation was considered an added cost.”He says that success requires: identifying champions, harnessing the public including patients; creating spaces for learning; eliminating old ways of working; and providing incentives for new ones to be adopted.Much more innovation is required in the implementation of innovation itself."
29;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2013-11-14T00:59:34Z;Mechanical solution to type 1 diabetes in sight;Hormone regulators linked to smartphones are on the way;Building an “artificial pancreas” to replace the patient’s insulin-producing organ after it fails is an important theme of diabetes research.There are two very different approaches to the artificial pancreas.The biological approach – to develop a new organ through cell therapy and tissue engineering – is the subject of a separate article.The other, covered here, is electronic and mechanical: to develop devices that monitor glucose levels and pump insulin into the patient as and when the hormone is needed.A leading centre of artificial pancreas research is at Cambridge university’s Institute of Metabolic Science, led by Roman Hovorka. His work is funded by two big charities, Diabetes UK and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, as well as government agencies.This year, Dr Hovorka’s team carried out the world’s first clinical trial, in which patients used an artificial pancreas at home without medical supervision. The 24 participants used the device over periods of four weeks at night, when there is particular risk of their blood glucose levels falling too low.Alasdair Rankin, research director of Diabetes UK, says: “After years of scientists discussing the possibility of an artificial pancreas, we are now at the exciting point where people are using them in their homes.“This means we have reached a landmark in the development of a technology that offers real hope for a future where type 1 diabetes does not mean having to think constantly about the balance of blood glucose levels and insulin, or having to face a much higher risk of dying early.”Dr Hovorka is working with Cambridge Consultants, the product development company, on a new version of the artificial pancreas. It will link a continuous glucose meter – implanted just below the skin to read blood sugar levels every minute or so – via Bluetooth to a smartphone or tablet computer. This in turn controls the insulin pump that delivers the hormone into the bloodstream through a catheter.“Trialling the system in a natural setting over a longer time period is the next stage in making the system widely available,” said Dr Hovorka. “To do this, it must work completely autonomously.”Dr Rankin expects the system to be used only at night for the time being. “However, as the technology progresses, we expect it to make type 1 diabetes an increasingly manageable condition, until eventually we will reach the point where people might check their artificial pancreas when they get up in the morning and then not have to think about their diabetes for the rest of the day,” he says.Several medical device companies are working on the technology, both independently and in collaboration with JDRF. Although the insulin pumps now on the market require patients to set their dosing levels, they are becoming easier to use.The latest one from Medtronic, called Paradigm Veo, has a “low glucose suspend” mechanism that automatically stops insulin delivery when glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, to prevent severe hypoglycaemia.At the same time, the sensors that monitor glucose levels in the blood are improving. JDRF and Medtronic are collaborating to develop a device that incorporates two independent measurement techniques. It will combine a glucose oxidase sensor – an electrochemical detector commonly used in today’s monitors – with a new optical sensor, to provide more accurate readings.“The next step will be a ‘treat-to-range’ system that deals with both high and low glucose levels,” says Sarah Johnson, JDRF UK policy director. “Then the idea will be to tighten the range, so that eventually we get a ‘treat-to-target’ device that maintains the optimum levels the whole time. That really will be an artificial pancreas.”
30;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2013-10-01T14:57:17Z;Medical taxes: own devices;US budgetary impasse might have a silver lining;"Amid the partisan rancour, little patches of agreement persist. Consider the excise tax on medical devices, which helps to fund President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. A repeal of the tax has been floated as part of a compromise which would give the Republicans a face-saving victory and get the government running again. Many Democrats have signalled their willingness to repeal it. A truce – which remains unlikely – might be a boost for bipartisanship but would be only a modest help to device makers.The Affordable Care Act levies taxes to fund itself. In exchange, 50m potential customers get health insurance. The medical devices industry’s contribution is a 2.3 per cent sales tax that took effect this year. Device makers, which saw demand drop after the crisis, say the tax has led to restructuring.Most of the big device companies – Medtronic, Stryker, Boston Scientific, Zimmer, Smith & Nephew – have underperformed the market since Mr Obama’s inauguration. The average forecast sales growth at those companies is 2 per cent in 2013, according to S&P Capital IQ.This pattern cannot be explained just by politics. Hospital mergers have made for tough price negotiations; a lack of innovation in the biggest product categories has hurt pricing too.Note that Edwards, which recently introduced a truly innovative product (a replacement heart valve delivered through a catheter), has outperformed significantly over the past five years.A political compromise may end the tax (more spending but less revenue) but with their new discipline, device makers are already strengthening. Average revenue growth is expected to be above 4 per cent in 2014 with earnings growth more than twice that. A tax cut would be a bonus, but it is the companies, not Washington, doing the heavy lifting.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
31;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2013-09-01T23:17:05Z;Medtronic wins key NHS labs contract;;Medtronic, the US medical devices company, has won contracts to take over the management of important cardiology services at two leading English National Health Service entities, as it diversifies into healthcare delivery.University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Trust and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London have signed long-term partnerships handing Medtronic the management of their catheterisation laboratories, responsible for producing diagnostic images of the heart and arteries.The move marks an important shift of Medtronic away from the sale of equipment more directly into health service delivery. It will be providing staff in hospitals to run day-to-day management of the laboratories, as well as supplies and training and acquisition of new devices.However, the approach risks triggering a debate over potential conflicts of interest, given that the partnerships include a guarantee for a proportion of the equipment acquired to be bought from Medtronic rather than rival suppliers of competing imaging devices.It comes at a time of growing experimentation of new ways of managing healthcare systems more efficiently. The NHS has outsourced some other technologically focused facilities, for example kidney dialysis, to private equipment providers such as Hospira.Rob Ten Hoedt, Medtronic president for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Canada, responsible for the new Medtronic Health Solutions division, said: “We have to be part of the solution in the delivery of care.”He said he expected the new long-term contracts, set to last 5-7 years, to provide cost savings of 10-20 per cent, citing a pilot programme in Maastricht in the Netherlands that had generated efficiencies of $6m in one year through measures including a reduction in “downtimes” when equipment was not being used.He said clinicians would continue to decide which medical devices to use, but each partnership agreement would include a negotiated minimum proportion of purchases of Medtronic equipment. “Half would be nice,” he said.Felicity Goodey, chairman of the South Manchester trust, called the partnership her organisation had agreed with Medtronic “exciting” and stressed that “our clinicians must have final say on the devices that they use”.“Our core business is not building and maintaining very high-specification, highly technical operating theatres, but treatment and care,” she said. “All our medical teams will have to worry about is walking in and doing the job. We believe that can only help the patient.”We have to be part of the solution in the delivery of careJamie Reed MP, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: “The Government’s marketisation of the NHS has opened the door to a growing list of US firms and potentially worrying conflicts of interest. Ministers need to make sure patients are put before profits.”Medtronic plans in future to provide similar long-term hospital management services for cardiac surgery, neurology and spinal operations, all areas where it already produces medical devices.The company recently took a 30 per cent stake in NGC Medical, an Italian company providing similar catheterisation services, and in August began exploring patient monitoring to help the management of chronic disease with the $200m acquisition of Cardiocom of the US.Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that his group would “develop innovative services and solutions that create efficiencies, address costs and improve patient access and outcomes for a broader set of hospital customers.”
32;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2012-09-28T20:13:03Z;Medtronic bolsters foothold in China;;Medtronic is to pay $816m for China’s KangHui Medical, which makes implants to treat orthopaedic conditions, as the US medical devices maker tries to bolster its foothold in one of the world’s fastest growing healthcare markets.The deal could help improve the growth prospects for one of the world’s biggest medical device makers at a time when it is under pressure from tightening government budgets in the developed world in its core cardiac and spinal products.China’s healthcare market is growing rapidly, fuelled by Beijing’s efforts to improve medical care to defuse potential social unrest and respond to the growth OF the country’s middle classes.Foreign companies and private equity investors have been looking specifically at sectors such as treatments for kidney- and diabetes-related conditions as changes in lifestyle and behaviour lead to higher occurrences of such problems.The Chinese medical devices sector alone is expected to grow at an annualised 12 per cent rate, according to a survey this year by Citigroup. This has sparked strong interest from foreign groups looking for acquisitions. Smiths Group of the UK last year bought Zhejiang Zheda Medical Instrument while Vasomedical bought two China-based medical device companies, Life Enhancement Technology and Biox Instruments.Medtronic has already spent money on establishing a presence in China, paying $221m for a 15 per cent stake in Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer in 2007. Medtronic aims to make one-fifth of its sales in emerging markets by 2016.Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s chairman and chief executive, said the deal fitted well with this strategy. “KangHui represents a significant investment in China, accelerating Medtronic’s overall globalisation strategy with an established . . . distribution network and strong research and development and operational capabilities.”Chris O’Connell, president of Medtronic’s restorative therapies group, said: “China is one of the fastest growing medical device markets, with significant scale opportunities, and now Medtronic will establish a bigger and more direct local presence.”Medtronic will pay $30.75 per American depositary receipt for KangHui, which is based in Changzhuo, Jiangsu, but listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a 22.5 per cent premium to Thursday’s close. KangHui’s cash holdings mean the enterprise value of the deal is $755m.At this price Medtronic is paying about 32 times 2011 earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation. KangHui, which was founded in 1997, saw profits rise 21 per cent to Rmb121m ($19.3m) last year on sales of Rmb327m, according to Bloomberg data.Libo Yang, KangHui’s chief executive, said his company would bring to Medtronic local operating expertise in China, including a wide distribution network, local manufacturing and R&D.KangHui’s ADRs climbed 21 per cent to $30.38. They have risen more than 50 per cent since the end of June. Medtronic’s shares closed down 0.8 per cent at $43.12.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai
33;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Medical device groups ‘fail to innovate’;;Medical device companies are themselves to blame for falling margins because they are failing to innovate sufficiently, said Olivier Bohuon, chief executive of Smith & Nephew.Mr Bohuon, who has been restructuring the UK-based device company since his appointment a year ago, told the Financial Times that the industry should launch new products rather than cutting prices and blaming budget-conscious government.“When we talk about price erosion – 3-4 per cent a year – many people are blaming this on government austerity measures, but they are wrong,” he said. “What is happening is that we as an industry are not bringing in enough innovative products to get higher prices.”Mr Bohuon, who left Abbott, the US drug company, to join Smith & Nephew in April last year after a short spell at Pierre Fabre of France, said healthcare providers were prepared to pay a premium for the devices that would save them money in the long term.“When you don’t innovate, your portfolio becomes older, and then in order to be successful in tenders you have a tendency to drop your prices,” he said. “Innovation is the bread and butter of this business.”Mr Bohuon’s comments come as the medical devices sector faces increased regulation and tighter margins. S&N, along with rivals such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Zimmer, is dependent on government reimbursement for much of its turnover, and has seen margins squeezed during the economic downturn as healthcare budgets are cut.The pressure was reflected in S&N’s trading margins for 2011 unveiled in February, which were down 2 percentage points year on year to 22.5 per cent, in spite of revenues rising 4 per cent to $4.27bn.But Mr Bohuon said he was reallocating capital internally at the company to focus on areas providing the greatest potential returns, and placing increasing emphasis on innovative products including in wound care and orthopedics, where it has launched more bespoke products supported by computer-aided design.S&N last year pledged to increase its research and development budget by $300m over the next five years, bringing R&D spend up to 5 per cent of group revenues.Although best known as Europe’s largest maker of artificial hips and knees, S&N has turned its attentions towards sports medicine and wound-management devices, such as negative pressure bandages and highly-specialised tools for keyhole surgery.Its wound-management division launched 35 products in 2011 and is poised to match that number in 2012.“We try to focus on where we need to go, but it’s also important not to remain a step behind our rivals. You cannot say that just because it is difficult to innovate that you don’t want to go there,” said Mr Bohuon.“It is easier to innovate in areas other than orthopaedics. You don’t invent a new hip or a knee every other day.”Last month S&N acquired LifeModeler, a provider of biomechanical software that simulates the human body’s movements, in order to speed up the testing of its orthopaedic products
34;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2012-02-06T20:00:32Z;Smith & Nephew in $22m bribes fine;;US regulators have fined Smith & Nephew $22m for bribing Greek doctors to use its products over the past decade, in an intensifying series of actions against healthcare companies for corruption that took place in foreign countries.The UK-based medical devices company agreed to a settlement with the Department of Justice and the appointment of an official to supervise its compliance procedures over the coming 18 months.The action follows a similar $77m settlement by regulators with Johnson & Johnson last year concerning bribes paid in Greece, Poland, Romania and Iraq, with at least another dozen healthcare companies under investigation for violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.It comes as officials struggle to restructure Greece’s public sector after years during which corruption and mismanagement helped substantially inflate use of medical products.Charges filed by the justice department alleged that Smith & Nephew oversaw a system that channelled more than $9m in bribes through a maze of offshore companies to persuade Greek surgeons to use its artificial hips and knees. The network was one of several unearthed during a probe by the US in 2007 into corruption by medical device groups in Greece, with probes continuing against rivals including Biomet, Stryker, Zimmer and Medtronic.In an email cited by prosecutors, Smith & Nephew’s Greek distributor, who controlled three offshore shell companies designed to strip out up to 40 per cent of the nominal sale price for commissions, justified the system to a senior US executive, saying competitors were paying 30-40 per cent more. “I absolutely need this fund to promote my sales with surgeons, at a time when competition offers substantially higher rates,” he wrote in 2002, describing the cash incentives as “a real pain in the neck but an unavoidable fact of Greek life”. He added: “I am paying cash incentives right after each surgery.”As a result of the probe, Smith & Nephew also identified separate problems with Plus, another orthopaedics company that it acquired in 2008, leading to substantial restructuring.Olivier Bohuon, Smith & Nephew’s chief executive, said: “These legacy issues do not reflect Smith & Nephew today. But they underscore that we must remain vigilant every place we do business and let nothing compromise our commitment to integrity.”The system described by prosecutors shows the supply of orthopaedic products by Smith & Nephew’s German subsidiary with manufacturing operations in Greece via its Greek distributor who used shell companies to receive a share of sales for “promotion support” and “marketing” although no true services were provided in exchange.
35;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-12-05T20:51:20Z;Mediscare: bitter pill for device makers;Manufacturers should tremble when the government threatens to tighten the leash;What will the federal bureaucrats do next? In the latest outrage, they may demand to know before the government pays for an operation whether the patient needs it.Shares in medical device makers and hospitals tanked on Friday after news that a Florida Medicare administrator would audit patients’ medical records before paying for certain costly cardiovascular and orthopaedic procedures. The report seemed to dovetail with a statement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that similar audits would be implemented in 11 states representing half of the US population. Stocks mostly bounced back on Monday when it appeared the two announcements might be unrelated.Device manufacturers should tremble though when the government threatens to tighten the leash. Companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific, St. Jude and Zimmer are all heavily dependent on the named procedures and on public reimbursement. At Medtronic, for example, half of US revenues come from the government. Publicly traded hospitals may be safer: a Credit Suisse analysis finds that the procedures amount to about 1 per cent of their revenues.If the audits are conducted fairly and competently (not a foregone conclusion, of course), the device companies will only suffer in the long term if the procedures are currently being performed on many patients who won’t benefit significantly from them. This has been the case in the past with cardiac stents and spinal devices, for example.Whether it is true now, and whatever happens in Florida, expect more announcements of increased scrutiny from Medicare. This only makes sense in a system where providers are paid by the procedure rather than for outcomes, and where healthcare consumes a fourth of federal spending and counting.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
36;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-12-05T15:28:17Z;Medical technology companies lead Wall St rally;Financial sector surges on possible Eurozone deal;Healthcare stocks bounced back from Friday’s big sell-off but analysts remained concerned that government healthcare schemes may limit expensive cardiovascular and orthopedic treatments.Hospital manager Tenet Healthcare jumped 12.4 per cent to $4.70, reversing nearly all of its losses from Friday, when Wells Fargo analysts had said 11 different states will study heart, knee and spine cases before agreeing to pay for hospital stays and treatments.Nuvasive, which manufactures equipment for spinal surgery, popped 13.3 per cent to $14.53, also recovering all of Friday’s losses.St Jude Medical, Medtronic and Boston Scientific rose 3.9 per cent to $37.21, 4 per cent to $35.98 and 1.8 per cent to $5.60, respectively, but were still several percentage points lower than Friday’s opening price.Analysts were struggling to understand the implications of a pilot scheme, announced in November by the Centre for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to conduct checks before authorising some treatments in states with high levels of improper payments.Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo’s hospital analyst, said all 11 states involved in the pilot would follow the example of Florida and begin pre-auditing a wide range of treatments, forcing hospital management companies to cut back on procedures to avoid falling foul off the audit schemes.“This will likely reduce procedure volume because hospitals will begin making sure that every patient meets the coverage criteria,” Mr Biegelsen told clients.But a Credit Suisse note, arguing that the procedures in question accounted for only 1 per cent of hospital revenues helped Tenet recover losses.The CMS also refused to confirm what shape the pilot scheme would take in states other than Florida, leading other analysts to conclude the sell-off in device makers was overdone.Elsewhere, US stocks were broadly positive with the S&P 500 closing up 1 per cent to 1,257.08. The benchmark US index had been us as much as 1.5 per cent before news the Standard and Poor’s is reviewing its sovereign rating on 6 eurozone sovereigns including Germany, knocked stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 per cent to 12,097.83.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.1 per cent to 2,655.76.“Positive news flow from Europe is driving stocks,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at ING.“But the S&P 500 is seeing resistance at the 200-day moving average above 1,260. If you were long from the November lows, it’s a good place to take profit and, if you have money on the sidelines, it seems a bit high to be initiating new long positions,” he added.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 handily outperforming all other sectors with a 2.1 per cent rise.Morgan Stanley climbed 6.8 per cent to $16.57. New York-based investment bank Jefferies continued to rally, rising 4 per cent to $12.90.As recently as two weeks ago, the bank had hit year lows of $9.50 on concern about its exposures to European sovereign debt and short-term funding needs.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $29.83.Goldman Sachs financial services analyst Richard Ramsden beat the drum for US banks ahead of a Goldman banking conference this week.“Fundamentals don’t appear nearly as bad as valuations imply,” he told clients, while acknowledging that hedge funds significantly reduced their weightings to financials in the third quarter.Newfield Exploration fell 3.4 per cent to $44.03 as investors reacted guardedly to its agreement to supply Tesoro Corporation’s Salt Lake City refinery with 18,000 barrels of oil per day from 2013 from planned growth in the Uinta Basin.“Management had been flagging this announcement for a week,” said Subash Chandra, an oil analyst at Jefferies, “but when it came it was underwhelming. There’s no revenue till 2013, and we’re still waiting for updates from new fields within the basin.”Time Warner fell 1.7 per cent to $62.71 on mixed reaction to its plans to make films available for consumers to watch on any platform through a cloud verification service.Gannett climbed 10.2 per cent to $13.13 after Lazard analysts recommended clients buy the stock, tipping the media company to raise its dividend soon.“Cloud” software provider Salesforce.com was the main beneficiary of a Standard and Poor’s note forecasting a round of acquisitions in the software industry.

the second quarter of this year.“The company has been buying its own stock high and is now selling it low. It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65.

This will take time;The largest medical device company in the world by enterprise value is also the cheapest. Medtronic’s combination of a low price-to-earnings ratio (9 times) and a high dividend yield (2.7 per cent) and free cash yield (10 per cent) is unmatched. This is surely frustrating to new chief executive Omar Ishrak, who has precious few options for earning a re-rating of the shares other than the most difficult one of all: ramping up sales growth.In the quarter reported on Tuesday, Medtronic beat expectations by a shade (this was enough to move the shares up a few points). But sales grew just 3 per cent, even with help from acquisitions. About half of the company’s revenues come from markets – cardiac rhythm and spinal surgery – that are growing very slowly and shrinking, respectively. The remaining businesses face headwinds from the global economy and, more importantly, tightening government budgets. And about half of Medtronic’s US revenues come from government health spending, a big part of which is set to be hit with mandatory cuts after the Congressional “super committee” failed to reach a budget compromise.Some analysts suggest Medtronic should unlock value by splitting up. Are they right? There are synergies, and technological overlap between the low- and high-growth businesses. Non-core segments have already been sold. How about allocating capital differently? The fairly even split between acquisitions, share buy-backs and dividends makes sense.Growth is what the doctor ordered and emerging markets, just a 10th of Medtronic’s sales, offer it. This will take time: the company hopes to double this proportion over five years. Government budgets appear to be getting stingier in developed markets though. Medtronic’s growth, if it accelerates, will do so slowly. Given the valuation, that may be enough.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
39;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-11-22T18:35:13Z;Business groups lament supercommittee’s failure;Healthcare sector is most displeased;Corporate America reacted with dismay to the failure of the Congressional supercommittee to reduce the US deficit, with John Engler, the president of the Business Roundtable, describing it as a ”serious setback for America’s fiscal stability”.Many US business leaders see burgeoning debt as a serious long-term threat to the country’s economy and competitiveness, given that it could eventually lead to higher borrowing costs. But there are also concerns that the lack of a deficit reduction plan could further dent fragile confidence in the American recovery now. “The number one challenge facing small business today is economic uncertainty – something this failure will only exacerbate,” said Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association.Some in business had been counting on the deficit panel to at least set in motion, if not approve, reforms to America’s outdated corporate tax system to lower the top rate of 35 per cent, one of the highest in the developed world. That effort, which had been gaining momentum in Congress, could now be delayed until after the November 2012 elections. “We run the risk of going in the wrong direction,” said Mr Engler. “All of that is for sure on hold at the moment.”But dig deeper, and companies in some sectors, such as healthcare providers, are lamenting the lack of agreement more than others, like the oil industry, that might have suffered more if the panel had reached a deal.Most displeased with the collapse of the deficit panel are a wide range of groups, including defence and other government contractors, as well as providers of healthcare coverage for the elderly, that will be hit by automatic spending cuts set to be introduced in 2013 as a penalty for failure.US healthcare companies, for instance, expressed deep concern with the prospect of a 2 per cent cut to Medicare as a result of the committee’s failure to reach an agreement. The cuts would result in a loss of $137bn in annual funding for Medicare, reducing payments to hospitals and doctors and chipping away at funding for medical research and drug reimbursements.“Cuts are never anything that helps us. It always puts pressure on us, so to that degree it will hurt,” Omar Ishrak, chief executive of Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device company, told the Financial Times. “But having some degree of certainty will help so that we and hospitals can plan around it.”Analysts at Credit Suisse noted that the failure of the supercommittee might have saved the sector from even steeper cuts and that investors in health insurers and drug companies should be relieved.Nevertheless, the American Medical Association called the cuts triggered by the stalemate “robotic”. Hospitals argue that they have already accepted steep funding cuts as a result of last year’s healthcare legislation and that the loss of additional resources could be crippling.“The compound effects of additional cuts reach far too deep,” said Graseck Ryan chief executive of the New Jersey Hospital Association.Meanwhile, Matt Bennett, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, warned that the automatic cuts could make it difficult for some patients to afford medicines.“It’s a challenge for the economy,” Mr Bennett said. “Our concern is ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to the medicines they need.”But other industries that aren’t targeted directly by automatic cuts may be breathing easier with supercommittee failure, especially if they were on a shortlist for possible tax increases or spending reductions. For instance, oil companies have for months been singled out by Democrats and the White House as a potential source of revenue for the government through the elimination or limitation of their tax deductions.“We are certainly not pleased that the supercommittee failed,” said Brian Johnson, senior tax policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents top energy producers in Washington. “However, we are glad that members realised that …targeting one industry with tax increases was not the path forward.”Also dodging a bullet are hedge fund managers and private equity executives who were possibly in line for higher taxes on their profits if so-called “carried interest” was taxed at the ordinary income rate rather than the lower capital gains rate. Michael Linden of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, said that for hedge fund managers and oil companies, this is only a “temporary reprieve”. But these groups did live to fight another day in future budget fights.
40;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-10-02T22:02:19Z;Medtronic chief defends ethical response;;Omar Ishrak, chief executive of Medtronic, has defended the medical device company’s handling of allegations that ethical problems were behind a problematic bone product that has been found to cause male sterility.Last June, a group of spine specialists argued in a series of studies in June that Medtronic’s researchers had left out information about complications when carrying out tests of a problematic bone product. That came after the US Senate finance committee asked Medtronic to hand over documents relating to this product as part of an investigation to determine if the medical researchers in charge of the trials had improper financial ties to the company.“Those are very serious allegations and I took them very seriously and addressed them,” Mr Ishrak said in an interview with the Financial Times.Medtronic has addressed the issue by commissioning a group of scientists from Yale University to study the data that it submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration about the bone product, called Infuse. Mr Ishrak said that the group is a few months away from issuing a report that will reveal any “cracks” in the data, at which time the company will make the results public.The company, which is the world’s largest medical device maker by revenues, also said it continues to submit documents to US senators regarding the conflicts of interest claims. Mr Ishrak said Medtronic was establishing more stringent “guard rails” to prevent conflicts of interest with physicians by requiring more transparency and disclosures.“There’s a process through which the monitoring of our processes occurs,” Mr Ishrak said. “Everything is documented and there are paper trails.”The controversy surrounding Medtronic comes as Mr Ishrak took over as chief executive last summer. He is looking for new ways to drive growth as sales of medical devices have slowed in the US and the company’s investment in research and development has not yielded sufficient returns.Les Funtleyder, analyst and fund manager at Miller Tabak, said that Medtronic has a history of overpaying for acquisitions and that the company’s spine and cardiac businesses are suffering.“Their core businesses are running into some problems and they need to figure out how to build a pipeline of genuinely innovative products,” Mr Funtleyder said.Mr Ishrak said that Medtronic’s pipeline should not be underestimated and that the company was now focusing more on “customer economics” when developing new products.Meanwhile, the company will look to emerging markets to drive growth in the short term. Mr Ishrak said that India, which currently represents about $100m in annual sales, is potentially a $3bn market for Medtronic.“We need to accelerate globalisation,” he said.
41;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Medtronic chief rues US approval process;;US medical device companies would benefit from adopting Europe’s product approval system, Medtronic’s chief executive said, arguing that the US Food and Drug Administration’s process takes too long to get products to market.Omar Ishrak, chief executive of Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device maker by sales, said he respected the FDAs conservative approach but noted that in Europe new medical devices reached the market 18 to 24 months sooner. “The response time is quicker, the clinical trial cycle is quicker, and maybe some of the barriers are less stringent,” Mr Ishrak told the Financial Times.When asked if the US should adopt a more European approach, Mr Ishrak said: “It will certainly put products on the market more quickly, so from a very selfish device manufacturer perspective, absolutely.”Mr Ishrak’s comments come as the FDA finds itself under pressure to accelerate its process for device and drug approvals amid criticism that it has been too slow.“FDA approval of new products is deterring new investment in innovation,” said Jonathan Leff, managing director at Warburg Pincus who leads the private equity group’s healthcare investments. “In the face of attention from Congress and consumer groups focused on drug safety, the way that FDA balances risk versus benefit in drug approvals has evolved over the last decade in such a way that it has added significant cost, time and uncertainty to the drug development process.”According to an analysis by Arcoda Capital Management, the FDA approval process has pushed more clinical trials to Europe. Between 2004 and 2010, more than half of all novel devices were first approved in Europe. In 2004, 86.9 per cent of all medical device studies were being carried out in the US but by 2009 this figure had dropped to just 45 per cent.“Generally, Europe, in both drugs and devices, has had a more efficient process of approving new drugs and devices than the US,” said Michael Meyers, Arcoda’s chief executive. “The FDA is becoming more conservative in their review of devices, which has caused delays getting new products to consumers.”In spite of such concerns from healthcare investors, the US Government Accountability Office said last April that the FDA had fallen short on promises to allow certain high-risk devices to be sold without more strenuous testing.Meanwhile, the FDA said it has significant concerns about calls to improve innovation by adopting the EU approval model. It said that the US process is more secure because European manufacturers do not have to demonstrate that their products effectively treat or diagnose the conditions they are approved for, and because those manufacturers choose and fund reviews on their devices.“Lowering the US approval standard by importing the EU model under the guise of ‘reform’ is not in the best interests of American patients who may receive ineffective or unsafe devices, our healthcare system that would pay for them, or US companies whose success relies on the American public’s confidence in their products,” the FDA said.As for Medtronic, Mr Ishrak said that he has not seen a greater number of safety problems from devices approved in Europe.
42;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-08-23T22:57:57Z;Medtronic says stiff rules will hit innovation;;Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device maker by revenues, said on Tuesday that attempts by regulators to clamp down on financial relationships between device companies and doctors that invent new products could suppress innovation.“Regulations are evolving but it is important to recognise that working with physicians is the lifeblood of this innovation industry and it’s important that we don’t stifle that,” Omar Ishrak, chief executive of Medtronic, told the Financial Times.Mr Ishrak’s remarks come as the company has come under fire from a group of spine specialists who argued in a series of studies in June that Medtronic’s researchers had left out information about complications when carrying out tests of a problematic bone product. The US Senate finance committee has asked Medtronic to hand over documents relating to this product as part of an investigation to determine if the medical researchers in charge of the trials had improper financial ties to the company.Mr Ishrak said Medtronic defended its policies and added that it had “guardrails” in place such as caps on physician payments and additional disclosures about royalties that doctors received for their inventions. Although he expressed concern about curbing innovation, which he called the “lifeblood” of the business, Mr Ishrak acknowledged companies should do more to eliminate conflicts of interest.“I do think it’s important to be careful about this and have regulations around it,” Mr Ishrak said. “We fully recognise that we cannot tolerate abuse in any way.”Medtronic has been at the centre of questions about conflicts of interest when its research found no adverse effects from the spine product Infuse, but later studies showed that up to half of patients who used it after spinal surgery had suffered problems. The bone growth product has been found to cause male sterility, according to The Spine Journal.Medtronic has funded an investigation into the inconsistency and said that it expects results within the next few months. Sales of Infuse fell by nearly 20 per cent year-on-year after articles about the product were published in The Spine Journal in late June.The controversy comes as Mr Ishrak is trying to revive Medtronic’s sales of spine and heart devices in the US. Both continued to be weak as the company reported first-quarter results on Tuesday that showed a 1 per cent year-on-year decline in net earnings to $821m, or 77 cents a share. Medtronic shares rose 6.16 per cent to $33.10.Analysts have suggested that Medtronic should consider selling some of its slower growth businesses and focusing on its more profitable products. Mr Ishrak said the portfolio he currently had made sense.Instead of divestitures, Mr Ishrak, who joined Medtronic after leading General Electric’s health unit, said he would increase the company’s focus on emerging markets and look for new ways to make research and development more productive.“We have made significant investments in R&D over the years, both internal and external, with frankly unsatisfactory returns,” he said.
43;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-07-18T18:16:20Z;Medical Devices;The industry once seemed to have it all;"Medical cost inflation may be out of control, but it is not showing up on the income statements of medical device makers. For many of the most important products – pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, orthopaedic implants, spinal implants and cardiac stents – revenue growth has slowed or turned negative over the past few years. Recent company reports show the trend continues.The industry once seemed to have it all: a demographic tailwind from an ageing rich world, defensiveness, exciting scientific innovation. Yet share performance in the past two years has been mixed, with firms focused on pacemakers/defibrillators and stents (Medtronic, St. Jude, Boston Scientific) underperforming badly while orthopaedic specialists (Stryker, Smith & Nephew, and Zimmer) have fared better.All these companies offer newer, fast-growing products, but few of these are likely to be as large as those that are struggling: Bernstein Research pegs global annual sales of pacemakers and defibrillators at $11bn; replacement hips and knees at $13bn. The faster-growing trauma market, for example, totals just $5bn.What is going on? In stents and spinal devices, debates over the strength of the underlying clinical data are reflected in slowing sales. In general, though, despite the secular forces pushing up demand, and the apparent non-discretionary nature of its products, the industry turns out to be surprisingly cyclical. The economic downturn has hurt. Patients’ insurance co-payments and deductibles, loss of job-based coverage and tougher negotiations with strapped hospitals are taking their toll. The critical question is whether economic recovery would restore the industry to health – or whether the crisis has taught doctors, hospitals and patients that they can get by without shelling out for the very latest medical gizmo.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
44;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
45;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Medtronic sees big value in iPads;Medical technology company one of the largest corporate users of the iPad;"Three days after Apple’s first generation iPad became available in April 2010, Michael Hedges, Medtronic’s chief information officer, had ordered 10 of them and had them shipped to Germany.The iPad, he reasoned, seemed like the kind of new technology that would attract attention to Medtronic’s booth at the German Cardiac Society Meeting in Mannheim.“We’ve never had foot traffic like that before at a congress,” said Mr Hedges who got his start in the British Army and has spent the past 25 years working in IT at several multinationals. “Yes, there was certainly a ‘wow’ factor, but it was clear there was something more that we could do with the iPad.”Like other companies that have been adopting the iPad like Edmunds.com, the car research website, and SAP, the German enterprise software vendor, Mr Hedges realised that the iPad was “a game changer” that had far-reaching potential – in Medtronic’s case as a healthcare tool to train doctors today and help patients manage chronic disease tomorrow.“We knew it was a technology that could fundamentally change our interactions with customers,” he says. So Mr Hedges ordered 5,000 of the tablet PCs for internal use, making Minneapolis-based Medtronic one of the largest corporate users of the iPad to date.“The iPad, and the larger wave of media tablets, has captured the imagination of business leaders,” says David Willis, research vice-president at Gartner. “Some companies have issued them to business and IT leaders in the spirit of exploration. Others see areas in which they can use media tablets to bring computing into settings that were not practical or were too cumbersome to use traditional approaches,” said Mr. Willis.Medtronic, the world’s largest independent medical technology company with 41,000 employees and revenues last year of $15.8bn, has developed several applications for the iPad.Taking advantage of the iPad’s visual capabilities has enabled Medtronic’s IT department to re-engineer sales and marketing applications. For example, a ‘virtual heart’ application provides a 3D visualisation of heart function.One application gives the company’s sales representatives one-touch access to marketing literature and journal articles that would require 10 pounds of paper to print.Another helps physicians get their questions answered quickly in a visually engaging way. “We were meeting with a customer who asked about one of our stents,” Mr Hedges explained. “Within seconds, a representative started the iPad, clicked on a multimedia about the stent, and showed the cardiologist everything he wanted to know. Not long ago, we would have had to dig around for a pamphlet, or wait for the laptop to boot up.”In adapting iPads to the enterprise, Mr Hedges and his IT team use a hybrid operating model that allows certain employees and collaborating companies to build applications. “We work for two or three weeks to develop an app, and then give the business (unit) a chance to comment and improve on it,” he explains.The iPads have been so successful that sales and marketing, R&D and other groups now actively seek IT involvement in new projects. “They see us as a source of Innovation,” Mr Hedges sas. “With the iPad, we found a solution credited with motivating sales and marketing professionals, spurring productivity and engaging in a better way with our customers.”Medtronic says the iPad allows the company to explain its innovative technologies in a fundamentally different way, helping increase understanding among its key customers. Now, the company is looking at the next step: developing applications that can translate the massive amount of information the human body generates and Medtronic currently measures — think heart rates, blood glucose levels, brain wave activity — into understandable, useful data that patients can access on their tablet computers, allowing them to better manage their health.“Think about parents with children who have diabetes, as an example,” Mr Hedges said. “We’re working toward a day when a parent can get updates to their iPad or other device sent from a Medtronic sensor monitoring their child’s blood sugar. Let’s say a child is at camp and her blood sugar drops, but she doesn’t realise it while she’s horseback riding. There could be an application that sends parents an alert, so they can contact someone at the camp to avoid a major health issue.”“We are in the business of improving and saving lives. When you have such a mandate, you are obliged to find and implement innovative information technology to get your devices to the people who need them as fast as possible.”Despite some initial concerns, help desk support calls have risen only slightly since Medtronic introduced the iPads and the only significant impact on the company’s application architecture has been the addition of security tools and content management software.Mr Hedges believes incorporating consumer technologies into IT begins with extending IT operations to cover them. “Since the roll-out, we have learnt how to use such disruptive technologies to drive business productivity,” he says.Indeed he believes that one of the biggest benefits of introducing consumer technologies into the enterprise is their inherent speed. “If IT does not act with speed, the business will; and it will find the value IT has missed. Unless CIOs embrace these new consumer technologies, they won’t be able to change the perception of IT for the better.”"

Snapping up the device maker for a cool $20bn may be just what the doctor ordered for Johnson & Johnson which, while not quite broken, has been prone to some nasty spills lately. It lost nearly $1bn in sales last year due to various product recalls and has been on the prowl since failing to consummate a big deal for British device manufacturer Smith & Nephew.Buying Synthes is about much more than bolstering J&J’s wounded portfolio though. A leader in other parts of the orthopaedic market, J&J remains a bit player in trauma, Synthes’s forte. An ageing population translates to far more broken bones in coming decades, just as it means more artificial hips and knees (where J&J already has scale). Synthes controls about half of this business, valued at more than $5bn, around a fifth of the overall orthopaedics market. And its spinal products business would help J&J edge closer to market leader Medtronic.Analysts at UBS reckon the rumoured price would be mildly accretive for J&J’s earnings per share if financed mostly with cash. Moreover, as a US-based but Swiss-listed company, Synthes would allow J&J to deploy the large chunk of its $28bn gross cash position now held abroad and otherwise prone to US taxes if repatriated. Antitrust concerns are an issue but not a big one. J&J is so puny in trauma that its key competitors would face tougher hurdles, making counter bids less likely.J&J remains mum on the deal, perhaps for good reason. Synthes has put itself into play by confirming talks, which may boost a mooted price that seems modest based on an unlevered earnings multiple. Synthes seems eager for players to take the stage, wishing them a hearty “break a leg”!E-mail the Lex team in confidence

Yet it is the most vulnerable UK bank to falling property prices and rising unemployment, said Mr Gordon.He also noted that the “glass ceiling” effect of the 40.6 per cent government stake in Lloyds, the shares of which were bought at an average of 74.4p each.The wider market drifted lower in thin trading that lacked the lead of Wall Street. The FTSE 100 ended down 16.37 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 5,985.7.Autonomy was the day’s sharpest faller, down 5.1 per cent to £14.65. Traders blamed profit-taking ahead of the company’s full-year results on February 1.“With the lack of a positive pre-announcement by Autonomy thus far, in our view the results are likely to be in line with or even just below consensus,” said S&P Equity Research, which cut Autonomy from its “buy” list.Schroders’ non-voting shares were down 2.4 per cent to £18.41 after a UBS downgrade. “Although we remain positive on flows and expect Schroders to perform well operationally, we believe that this upside is now being priced in,” it told clients.Among the gainers, Smith & Nephew was up 3.5 per cent to 709p following speculation in the weekend press that Johnson & Johnson might offer about 800p a share for the orthopaedics group. Medtronic was also mentioned as a potential bidder for S&N, which said on Friday that it was not in talks with anyone.Smiths Group jumped 7.7 per cent to £13.81 after rejecting as too low a £2.45bn bid from Apax Partners for its medical business. “We would consider £3.0bn as a minimum fair price,” said analysts at Bryan Garnier.Capita rose 2.9 per cent to 718½p on hopes that it will sign up F&C Asset Management as a new customer.F&C said last week that it was close to selecting a back-office outsourcing partner. Such a deal would add 1-2 per cent to Capita’s sales as well as providing the group’s life and pensions division with its first large contract win since January 2009, said JPMorgan Cazenove.Vague bid speculation helped lift RSA Insurance by 0.8 per cent to 135p with traders talking of a possible offer of about 175p a share. The insurer has been linked to several European peers including Aviva, which last year rejected a £5bn offer from RSA for its UK general insurance business.De La Rue was up 1.3 per cent to 788p on talk that Oberthur was preparing to increase its takeover offer, having last month had a 905p proposal rejected.A Société Générale downgrade to “sell” led Travis Perkins lower by 2.4 per cent to £10.88 with the broker arguing that the shares did not reflect the weak outlook for UK construction.Among small caps, Regal Petroleum rose 9.7 per cent to 31¼p after another investment vehicle declared a holding. Belize-based Platforma Capital said it had bought 3.4 per cent of Regal, which is subject to
a 24p-a-share offer from Ukraine’s Smart Holding.Property group Minerva added 14.9 per cent to 100p following Friday’s after-hours news of a bid approach. HMV rose 1 per cent to 25¼p on rumours of further stake building by Russian businessman Alexander Mamut.Kofax, the document scanning specialist, rose 4.9 per cent to 341p after announcing the sale of its hardware business to a management buy-out team and an upbeat trading statement. Dealers reckon the disposal makes Kofax a cleaner takeover target for a sector peer such as EMC.Southern Cross Healthcare rose 11 per cent to 20¼p on talk of a 50p a share bid approach.Nautilus Minerals jumped 23.8 per cent to 171½p after the company said it had been granted the world’s first deep sea mining lease off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Nautilus intends to mine high-grade copper and gold deposits."

In the fourth quarter, businesses spent more money on computers and storage, helping HP’s earnings and sales beat expectations.In the first earnings conference call since taking over as chief executive, Léo Apotheker provided few details of his plans except to say that software, which is only a small part of the business, will be a central theme.“With a conservative sales guidance, steadily expanding gross margins and expectations for higher operating expenses, we believe the company can pull multiple levers to beat [and/or] raise consistently through 2011,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.But rivals Dell fell 1 per cent to $13.82 and Intel lost 0.8 per cent to $21.09.J Crew Group jumped 16.8 per cent to $43.99 after the retailer agreed to be bought out by two private equity firms in a deal worth $3bn.

The $360m purchase marks News Corp’s first significant foray into the educational market.Shares in Dynegy dropped 2.7 per cent to $5.00 after it said it planned to end its agreement to sell itself to Blackstone Group because it does not have shareholder support. Blackstone declined 2.4 per cent to $12.93.Food companies Hormel Foods and Campbell Soup reported quarterly earnings Campbell Soup fell 2.4 per cent to $34.00 after it missed analysts' expectations. Profit was hit after the company deeply discounted its soups but the price cuts failed to spur sales.In contrast, Hormel Foods beat expectations sending the shares up 2.6 per cent to $49.15.Cost cuts in its refrigerated foods division and its turkey business offset rising raw material costs for its grocery products and speciality food segment. The company also raised its forecast for 2011 above

50;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2009-07-30T22:11:39Z;Value of deep thinking;;"At its Massachusetts head office, Reebok, as befits a large sports manufacturer, has a huge gym. But Ron Bartkiewicz, a health promotion manager, says the group does not just take care of employees’ bodies – it looks after their mental well-being, too.“One of the things we offer is meditation,” he explains. “It helps strengthen the mind, reduce stress and focus.”Mr Bartkiewicz himself meditates every day. “I used to hear about it and was never really quite sure,” he says. “But if you take the time to learn, it’s amazing. Even if you only have a minute, or you’re somewhere like the supermarket, it helps you to relax and improves your concentration.”Over at Medtronic, a medical device maker, they host quarterly meditation sessions. Jon Jagielski, supplier quality manager, says these typically last 90 minutes. “The practitioner puts on relaxing music and shows you a variety of techniques,” he explains. “You need to focus on something. It can be anything you want. I focused on visualising my breathing and the idea that I was filling up with air. The challenge is to maintain that focus; you acknowledge the outside distractions but you let them pass.”Mr Jagielski says he meditates three times a week. “It helps you to get perspective and organise your thoughts,” he says.Richard Geller of MedWorks, the meditation training company that runs Reebok and Medtronic’s classes, says: “There’s a need to reduce stress in the workplace and meditation is the best technique I know. You can do it any time, any place and anywhere – even for a second. It’s also very cheap: the return on investment is phenomenal.”Mr Geller says the problem with the modern working world is that the “fight or flight” response that evolved to help us assess life-or-death situations is used all the time.Meditating, even for a moment, he says, allows you to recognise that this is happening and step back from the situation and take a long view.It also allows workers to focus, rather than becoming distracted. “All this may sound simple, but it requires a lot of practice to get good at it. It really does make you mentally stronger,” he adds.Inner Space, a London-based meditation centre, also works with a variety of companies. “Some are small, but it tends to be mostly big multinationals as they have larger numbers of stressed people,” says Arti Lal, a co-ordinator for the organ­isation.Ms Lal says meditation can last from a minute to an hour and that it’s about resting your mind and “creating a bit of space for yourself and your thoughts”. When people do it at lunchtime, they find their afternoons are more productive. “We even teach people to meditate while they commute.”What’s more, she adds, meditation has never been more popular. “A few years ago, meditation was a bit of a fad and we thought people might drop it because of the recession,” she says. “But there’s much greater demand – it does help you keep a good, positive frame of mind.”Google also offers meditation. “It helps clarity of vision,” the company says. “In the workplace it gives our employees the time and headspace to unwind in the midst of their busy days. If people feel refreshed, and can take part in something like this with a group of like-minded people, then who knows what innovation this might lead to?”Twitter’s recently leaked office plans include a meditation room and Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport has a meditation centre.Businesses mindful of the downturn, and unwilling to spend on non-essentials, might be interested that Inner Space’s courses cost nothing “Even if we were to go into Goldman Sachs, it would be free,” says Ms Lal.Cary Cooper, professor of organisation psychology at Lancaster University, says that as much as anything the idea is about making a little bit of time for ourselves in the modern, always-on, open-plan workplace. “I’m not sure you even have to [call it] ‘meditating’ – it’s just taking 10 minutes out to put yourself in a peaceful space,” he says. “If you can’t do this because you work in an open-plan office, go out and find a bench in a park and sit down.“People live frenetic lives. Think about how much disposable time we have to ourselves – to take just half an hour to de-stress and relax can be incredibly powerful. Rather than fill their timetables, managers need to take time out to put themselves in a calming environment …They’re just not used to taking time out to think.”For those who want a bit more than meditation in the office, Maitreyabandhu, a teacher at the London Buddhist Centre, suggests a retreat that may last several days. “We see a number of business people who go on retreat regularly,” he says, but adds that the kind of deep thinking that a retreat promotes “can cause some people to question their whole careers”.Still, says Mr Geller, it’s not just those with too little time on their hands and too much distraction who need meditation; those at the other end of the spectrum need it, too. “I also work as a volunteer teaching meditation at the county jail here in Boston. Stress is everywhere,” he says."
51;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Wall Street slips in choppy trade;;US stocks recovered early losses on Tuesday but finished a choppy session slightly lower as Wall Street digested data from the commerce department showing that builders had started to build fewer homes in April than any month since 1959.Investors had been hoping for a positive start after home improvement retailer Home Depot reassured the market by earning more in the first quarter than analysts had predicted.Stocks slipped after the opening as the market reacted to headlines from the housing figures. But as the day wore on those losses were erased, with several economists saying good news was buried in the data.“Given the historical volatility, such a big fall will probably be reversed in May,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Housing activity may still be close to a floor, if it hasn’t reached it already.”Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, agreed, saying: “People read the report and realised it wasn’t so bad. The fall was driven by lower numbers of condominiums being built and the figures point that the housing market has found a bottom.”Financial stocks suffered on the data however. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and American Express all fell despite reports the companies are ready to pay back bail-out money.Goldman’s shares lost 1.4 per cent to $141.15, while JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon said the bank could pay back taxpayers’ money “within weeks”, lost 3.9 per cent to $35.81.American Express meanwhile said on Tuesday it would cut 6 per cent of its workforce – a total of 4,000 jobs – in an effort to save $800m over the rest of the year.But investors responded negatively to the restructuring plans, sending the shares down 5.1 per cent to $24.79.Of the banks believed to be ready to join the first group of companies approved to repay government money, only Morgan Stanley rose during the day, as it rose $596m by selling its remaining stake in its former investment analysis business MSCI. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent down at 908.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 8,474.85.The Nasdaq Composite index rallied, however, helped by a 2.4 per cent rise in Hewlett Packard‘s shares to $36.58 ahead of the company’s results, which were to be released after the bell.Volatility dropped to levels last seen before Lehman Brothers went bust last September as investors took confidence from another day of rallies.“With the pull back last week, all the strategists are now thinking they have maybe missed their opportunity and so have come running back into the market,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial.Homebuilders remained lower throughout the day, however, as the data continued to weigh.Pulte Homes finished 2.6 per cent lower at $10.03, while its prospective merger partner, Centex, dropped 2.9 per cent to $9.56.Investors also looked to earnings from Home Depot, the biggest US home improvement retailer, for clues on the state of the housing market.The company beat analysts’ profit forecasts after keeping costs low.But the shares slipped, with investors taking profit following a 6.6 per cent rise during the previous session on the back of results from its smaller rival, Lowe’s. They ended the day 5.3 per cent down at $24.63.There was some relief for Saks, the upmarket retailer, whose shares jumped 17.9 per cent to $4.81 as it reported a narrower loss than had been expected after cutting costs and inventories to cope with the consumer slump. The company warned sales would continue to decline for the rest of the year and said it would keep cutting costs to compensate.The steel sector performed well on figures showing raw steel production in the US rose last week. US Steel lifted 4.9 per cent to $29.94 and AK Steel climbed 5.9 per cent to $13.36.Medtronic, the largest US medical device maker by market value, fell 6.5 per cent to $31.76 after reporting disappointing profit and warning that its growth in 2010 would be below consensus estimates.
52;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2009-02-24T00:40:08Z;Medtronic in $1bn move into heart valves;;Medtronic, the US medical devices company, on Monday agreed to pay more than $1bn for two privately-held heart valve technology companies, which have developed devices to replace heart valves without invasive open-heart surgery.CoreValve, founded in 2001 by French heart surgeon Jacques Seguin, will be bought by Medtronic for $700m (€552m, £484m) plus performance-based milestone payments.The deal is one of the biggest exits for a venture capital-backed medical device company.It will also generate the largest profit for Sofinnova, the Paris-based venture capital company that was CoreValve’s first and biggest investor. Its other venture capital backers were Apax Partners, HealthCap and Maverick Capital.CoreValve, which recently moved from Paris to California, has developed and started selling transcatheter valve implants, a less-invasive surgical technique for replacing a diseased aortic valve using a catheter inserted through an artery in the groin.Medtronic said separately that it had agreed to pay $325m to acquire Israel-based Ventor Technologies, which is also developing transcatheter heart valve technologies for aortic valve disease.Both companies compete with Edwards Lifesciences in the fast-growing market, which could eventually replace open-heart surgery for the 300,000 patients who need an aortic valve replacement every year.“From a competitive standpoint, Medtronic’s entry into the transcatheter valve market certainly raises the stakes for Edwards,” said JPMorgan in a note to clients.Analysts said the deal could stifle speculation that Medtronic could merge with Edwards.Shares of Medtronic rose 35 cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $34.35 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Edwards’ shares fell $3.05, or 4.99 per cent, to $58.05.Antoine Papiernik, managing partner at Sofinnova, told the Financial Times: “We rejected several attractive offers from big corporates to sell CoreValve a year ago.“We put our money where our mouth was and believed this was a gem that we should hold until it was the right time to sell.”He said the deal would generate more than 10-times return on the investment by Sofinnova, which was the sole participant in CoreValve’s initial €4.5m ($5.7m) round of financing in 2003.CoreValve has sold 2,600 of its ReValving Systems, which cost €18,500-€20,000, in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America.It is still awaiting approval to be sold in the US, where it plans to start human trials this year.Mr Papiernik said the company turned profitable in the fourth quarter of last year.
53;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2008-10-01T20:40:32Z;Economic data add to Wall Street gloom;;Another volatile session for US stocks ended in the red as anxiety over paralysis in money markets and a Senate vote on the revised $700bn banking sector rescue package dwarfed even General Electric’s dramatic $15bn capital raising.GE led the declines on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the session as its credit default swaps widened. Yet the conglomerate later pared those losses to stand 5.2 per cent lower at $24.18 after it emerged that Warren Buffett would make a $3bn investment.Glum macroeconomic data underlined the parlous state of the US economy, although traders said that the prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off financial collapse took precedence over all other developments.“All these things normally the market would care about,” said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management. Now, he added, “we care [only] as much as it takes to read a headline”. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.2 per cent but later clawed back to close 0.5 per cent lower at 1,161.06, ahead of the Senate vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,831.07 while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.1 per cent at 2,069.40.Still, the moves were tame by recent eye-popping comparison. Stocks’ biggest rally for six years in the previous session followed their biggest sell-off for more than twenty.Industrials, down 2.6 per cent, led the market declines after a gauge of manufacturing activity – the economy’s silver lining this year – contracted further in September, falling to its lowest level since October 2001. The level is historically associated with a recession in the broader economy.Caterpillar and Honeywell lost 4.5 per cent at $56.95 and $39.68 respectively.A slew of other economic data – from job losses to mortgage applications – also hurt sentiment.Meanwhile, an oil price decline afforded the automotive sector scant comfort. Nor did news that President Bush had approved a $25bn package to help the sector. Ford sank 12.5 per cent to $4.55 after warning that US sales fell 34.6 per cent in September, to its weakest level of the year. It also said second-half profit at its European unit would be hit by falling demand and rising raw material costs.General Motors fell as much as 4.76 per cent but later recovered to stand 0.2 per cent higher at $9.47. Light vehicle sales fell 16 per cent in September.Financials and consumer staples, were the only sectors to enjoy rises of more than 1 per cent. Telecoms and utilities also inched into positive territory.Regional banks continued their recovery from Monday’s brutal sell-off. National City and Fifth Third leapt 65.1 per cent at $2.89 and 16.1 per cent at $13.82 respectively, the former helped by takeover speculation.Citigroup rose 12.1 per cent to $23.Energy stocks, which rallied in the previous session, lost 1.7 per cent as oil prices fell. Peabody Energy led the declines, down 8.8 per cent at $41.05.Airlines soared as crude-oil prices fell below $100. Delta Airlines, for example, added 14.8 per cent at $8.55.Among technology stocks, down 2.2 per cent, IBM was particularly hard hit. It fell 5.8 per cent at $110.13 on fears that the Dow component may have missed its third quarter profit targets.Elsewhere, Boston Scientific and Medtronic fell 7.6 per cent to $11.34 and inched down 0.2 per cent to $49.83 respectively after a court ruled that the pair had to pay $629m in interest to Johnson & Johnson down 2.2 per cent at $67.79. That took its total award in an 11-year patent case to $1.2bn.Ingersoll-Rand and Parker Hannifin fell 5.5 per cent to $29.46 and 3.6 per cent to $51.09 after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the two groups from “buy” to hold”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the fear gauge, inched up 0.5 per cent to 39.59, indicating extremely high levels of distress.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 1.5 per cent. Earlier in the session, it fell back below the level set when the ban was introduced last month but later recovered.Wal-Martlost 0.4 per cent at $59.66 after the retailer said it would cut prices on popular toys ahead of Christmas.
54;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2008-04-22T18:54:32Z;Medical devices shine;;It’s all in the joints. Shares in medical technology companies, having lagged behind broader indices last year, are now enjoying a respite and have outperformed by nearly 5 per cent this year. As well they should. Medical technology companies are truly defensive stocks. Like the pharmaceuticals companies with which they are often compared, most of medtech churns out products that are non-discretionary and paid for by governments or insurers. But medical device makers generally face shorter approval processes and less generic competition, giving them better growth prospects than their drugmaking cousins.The orthopaedic sector looks particularly promising. The huge baby boom generation is developing creaky joints and new products aimed at early intervention could expand the customer base. With $32bn in global sales in 2007, the segment is expected to expand 10 per cent annually until 2011, according to Espicom, a consultancy. They expect the fastest growth in spinal products and the still-small area of tissue repair agents. Joint replacement sales are expected to increase almost as quickly and market share is up for grabs after a change in marketing practices forced by a US government probe.Medtronic of the US is the clear leader in the spinal sector, with 37 per cent of the world market, but the area represents just a fifth of the company’s overall $12.5bn turnover. Investors interested in more exposure to orthopaedics should look to the US group Stryker and the UK’s Smith & Nephew, where such products made up 60 per cent and half of 2007 sales respectively. The latter is expected to report a less-than-stellar first quarter but was first into the US market with a new higher-priced hip repair method that preserves bone. Device sellers are expensive, trading on 30 times historical earnings, double the average for markets globally, but they may just be worth it.Post and read comments on this Lex
55;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2008-02-25T19:30:21Z;Streamlining US law;;The US Supreme Court struck a resounding blow for regulatory simplicity last week, handing down three cases in a single day holding that federal laws “pre-empt” state laws and lawsuits in similar areas. The subjects were wildly disparate: Maine’s effort to prevent cigarette sales to minors over the internet, a Florida contract dispute and, most prominently, a New York man’s effort to sue Medtronic over a catheter that burst during an angioplasty. But in all three rulings, the court acted to prevent what one justice referred to as a “patchwork” of different state laws that make life difficult for companies that want to operate all over the United States.These pre-emption cases are not isolated rulings. The Supreme Court has also cracked down recently on shareholder lawsuits that increase the cost of doing business. In January, the court held that only the Securities and Exchange Commission can go after business partners and professional service firms for helping a public company deceive its investors. Taken together, the picture is clear. While Congress dithers about streamlining US regulation to make the country more competitive, the Supreme Court is actually doing it.This is not entirely good news. State officials sometimes go overboard, but state vs federal competition can have real benefits, particularly for investors. The state attorneys general were instrumental in exposing the mutual fund and research analyst scandals and several are currently probing the subprime mortgage mess.Now that the Supreme Court is shifting the balance of power to the federal level, the onus is on Washington to live up to its expanded mandate. If the Food and Drug Administration and the SEC are to be sole regulators, they must have both the mandate and the money to do the job effectively. Streamlining regulation is a good thing. Using federal preemption as a smokescreen for eliminating all serious government oversight is something else entirely.Post and read comments on this Lex
56;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2008-02-20T21:04:47Z;Supreme Court ruling limits medical lawsuits;;"US companies on Wednesday won important new protections from lawsuits when the Supreme Court imposed new limits on suits brought by patients harmed by medical devices.Voting 8-1 in Riegel v Medtronic, the justices barred a suit from the widow of a man injured by a heart catheter that had been approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration. The issue was whether injured patients can second-guess the FDA by suing in a state court for products that have federal approval.The ruling was one of three on Wednesday in which the justices affirmed the supremacy of federal laws or regulations over often tougher state laws aimed at protecting consumers. The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed the ruling.“This is a great day for commonsense rulings from the court, which showed its appreciation for the problem of the Balkanisation of the economy by state laws and the difficulties of having to comply with inconsistent state laws in a national economy,” said Robin Conrad of the National Chamber Litigation Center, the legal arm of the US Chamber.Business suffered a defeat in another case on Wednesday, in which the justices ruled that workers who invest in 401(k) and other retirement plans can file suits claiming their individual accounts were mishandled.The ruling could lead to many more lawsuits against employers over the administration of their retirement plans. Jeff Russell, a retirement law expert at law firm Bryan Cave, said that before the ruling, “businesses were protected from claims unless an error impacted the entire [retirement] plan. But now an error affecting even a single participant will be grounds for litigation”.But Ms Conrad of the US Chamber said the ruling was narrower than expected: “It is one that we can live with, it could have been much more difficult for the business community.”The ruling in the catheter case will help medical device makers in thousands of lawsuits involving other heart devices and could also be good news for drugmakers, who are fighting two similar cases. Justice Antonin Scalia acknowledged that some medical devices approved by the FDA were risky and might injure patients, but the job of the agency was to weigh the risks against the need to make devices available to save lives.

57;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Business in court tussle on safety regulation;;The US business community went head to head with consumers on Tuesday at the Supreme Court as justices struggled to determine the role of lay juries in regulating potentially dangerous products that have already been approved by a federal regulator.The case before the court, Riegel v Medtronic, could have big implications for makers of medical devices and possibly other products. The issue before the court was: can patients bring state product liability lawsuits when the federal Food and Drug Administration has authorised a medical device for sale under its most rigorous approval process?The case is one of several this term in which the justices confront an issue of big importance to the business community: when do federal regulations pre-empt often tougher state personal injury laws?US business wants the broadest pre-emption possible, to avoid having to comply with different product safety rules in different states. Consumer advocates oppose federal pre-emption on the grounds that pre-emption gives companies a “get out of jail free” card even when they sell products they know are dangerous.“Congress made a decision that it wanted to balance the reasonable safety and effectiveness of life-saving devices against the availability of life-saving devices,” Ted Olson, former US solicitor-general, argued for Medtronic, which made a heart catheter that burst during an angioplasty.“We want devices to be as safe and effective as they can possibly be, but we don’t want to discourage the marketing of products that can save our lives.”Justice Anthony Kennedy, the potential swing justice on a narrowly divided court, joined several other justices in expressing scepticism that Medtronic should face a lawsuit over the catheter, which was approved for sale by the FDA. Several said the experts at the FDA, and not lay jurors, should determine safety and effectiveness. Justice Kennedy noted that juries do not “weigh potential risks and benefits” of a particular product. “Isn’t that exactly what the FDA does?” he asked the lawyer for the plaintiff’s widow.A decision preventing the suit against Medtronic is likely to affect thousands of cases, including claims over defibrillators made by Medtronic. Such a ruling might also shield the company, the world’s largest maker of electronic heart devices, from suits over its withdrawn Fidelis defibrillator wires.The Bush administration supported Medtronic, saying the FDA’s system of pre-market approval should preclude state-law claims that companies ought to have done more to ensure safety.

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
59;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2007-12-04T19:02:42Z;FDA and Supreme Court;;Drug and medical device manufacturers bedevilled by US product liability lawsuits have long wished they could find a complete shield from state courts – generally home to the wackiest claims and the most eye-popping judgments. In recent years, the drugs industry has argued that approval of a product by the Food and Drug Administration “pre-empts” all state claims. Manufacturers dream of a day when this doctrine holds sway, freeing billions of dollars in litigation reserves and allowing healthcare companies to ramp up their gearing.So far, the US courts have not bought the industry’s line. The supreme court’s previous decisions on the topic have been muddled, as it tried to balance the rights of states and injured patients with national commercial interests. The FDA itself shifted in favour of pre-emption under George W. Bush but could flip back after next year’s presidential election.The landscape may be changing. On Tuesday the court heard Riegel versus Medtronic, which deals with pre-emption for sophisticated medical devices, and in February it will take up Warner-Lambert v Kent, which looks at whether a state law that bans drug lawsuits can make an exception for claims that manufacturers obtained FDA approval through fraud. The cases mark the first time that justices Samuel Alito and John Roberts will consider pre-emption in the healthcare context. Some industry groups have high hopes that they care more about interstate commerce and less about states’ rights than their predecessors. Manufacturer victories would be good news for an industry smarting from the Vioxx withdrawal, which cost Merck more than $6bn in legal and settlement costs.Still, neither case addresses the larger issue of blanket pre-emption for drugs. And even if the court were to act, it could be overruled by Congress. Product liability lawsuits may be around for a long time to come.

But Mr Greenspan’s comments, in which he said recent growth in Chinese stocks was ‘unsustainable,’ led to the late downturn.A possible battle for control of Alcan was a major talking point. The Canadian aluminium producer’s board said shareholders should reject an unsolicited $27.6bn bid from US rival Alcoa.A Canadian newspaper report said Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton regarding a possible merger with the Australian miner. At the close,shares in Alcan were up 6 per cent at $85.89 and Alcoa was 3.7 per cent higher at $40.38.Materials stocks were one of the best-performing sectors in the S&P. Other rising sectors included energy, while utilities were lower and technology was weighed down by further weakness among chipmakers.The S&P was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.17, having reached 1532.43 earlier in the session, above its record closing price of 1,527.46 set on March 24 2000.The June S&P futures contract has set a new high of 1535.70 and traders said it was poised to test 1,540.20.But the S&P has not yet threatened its intra-day record high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Some analysts believe the recent consolidation in the S&P just below its record level has primed the index for a decisive move higher.“The longer we sit here, the more likely the S&P will move higher towards 1,600,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.One possible reason behind the S&P’s sideways trading earlier this week may have been investors selling the index as it initially tested record levels.“The record close is a good level to set a short position for a quick trade but, as the market starts to move higher, any shorts left may be forced to cover,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, speaking before the S&P’s afternoon swoon.“I get the feeling that, if the S&P stretches higher, it will force a lot of people to buy in,” he added.Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange said short trades on stocks, which make money if prices fall, had risen to a new record level.Technology shares were in focus as Amazon rose 5 per cent to $72.30 in early trading, a seven-year high after the online retailer said it was buying Brilliant Audio, the largest independent publisher of audio books in the US for an undisclosed amount. But Amazon gave back most of the gains to close up 0.17 per cent at $69.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,577.1.Semiconductor stocks were in negative territory, as Analog Devices slumped 10.1 per cent to $36.33.

64;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Efficacy of stents called into question;;A seven-year US study has called into question whether doctors are overusing heart stents, the blockbuster tiny wire mesh tubes used to prop open narrowing coronary arteries.The results of the study, called Courage, added more uncertainty to a stent market that recently has been thrown into flux over questions of safety, appropriate usage and new competition.This flux was also highlighted by a 7 per cent fall in the share price of Boston Scientific, a leading US stent maker, because new data showed a forthcoming stent by rival Abbott Laboratories could be better than its most important product, Taxus.Debate has swirled among the medical community, regulators and device-makers, raising questions over the past year on whether medical devices have been used too soon and too aggressively.Drug-coated stents, whose coating helps keep arteries from scarring and closing again, have been at the centre of that debate as one of the most widely used devices.Medical devices are increasingly feeling scrutiny, akin to that seen with pharmaceuticals, from doctors and US regulators concerned with potential emerging questions about long-term safety.In addition, as use of expensive devices has increased markedly, more scrutiny has fallen on the relative benefit of new medical devices. For instance, a recent Food and Drug Administration panel recommended against approval of a implantable heart data monitor by Medtronic, a US group, that could transmit patient data to a doctor via the internet.The Courage study, presented on Monday at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting, looked at whether people receiving stents and drug therapy had fewer deaths or heart attacks than those with drug therapy alone.Importantly, the study sought to find out if stents in patients with stable coronary artery disease – whose life was not acutely threatened – reduced risk of death and heart attacks because such a benefit “had not been shown”.The study said that, in 2004, more than 1m stents were implanted in the US and 85 per cent were done so in patients with stable disease.The Courage study found “no significant differences” by using bare-metal stents as compared with drug therapy alone, in death, heart attacks or stroke. It did find that patients with stents had fewer chest pains.
65;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2006-12-05T21:18:43Z;FDA panel set to review safety of stents;;"Drug-coated stents - once hailed as a revolutionary treatment for clogged arteries - will be the focus of a safety review by a US regulatory panel on Thursday following speculation about a possible heightened risk of later clotting.The tiny wire-mesh tubes, which are inserted to prop open closing arteries, are coated in drugs designed to to prevent arteries from reclosing, specifically from scar tissue.The two-day expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration will review the safety risks of such devices, including Boston Scientific’s Taxus, and rival Cypher by Johnson & Johnson.The panel will be looking at possible regulatory recommendations for the FDA on how the stents are used, what safety data is necessary, and the significance of the risk of the clotting - called late stent thrombosis.But the FDA advisory meeting also exemplifies recent shifts in western society about the weighing of risks and benefits. Safety of medical treatments is a hot-button issue for patients, legislators and regulators, particularly following the withdrawal two years ago by US drugmaker Merck of the painkiller Vioxx because of heart risks.Sociologists and risk experts say society’s perception of technology has undergone a subtle shift. Whereas in the industrial age, the concept goes, technology was seen as a solution, in the post-industrial age technology can be seen as a creator of problems, as much as a solution.The FDA’s past few years of controversies has highlighted this shift. The primary technologies of the FDA’s regulatory mandate - which covers a fourth of all US gross domestic product - have faced safety controversies.In traditional pharmaceuticals, there was Vioxx; in biotechnology, there were safety issues for Tysabri, a BiogenIdec treatment for multiple sclerosis; in medical devices, malfunctions of Guidant’s implantable cardiac defibrillators and safety questions about stents; and in consumer health, fungal infection concerns with Bausch & Lomb’s advanced contact solution.In addition, organic foods also attracted controversy in this year’s US recall of bagged spinach due to e-coli bacteria contamination.“The pendulum has swayed way toward safety,” said John Farrall, healthcare industries analyst for private client investments at US bank National City.New regulations, added safety warnings or changes to recommended usage could affect the lucrative US market for coated stents. They often cost nearly double the price of bare-metal stents, generating more than $5bn in US sales combined for Boston’s Taxus and J&J’s Cypher. Safety questions have hurt their usage rates, and negative panel conclusions this week could hurt them further.In meeting documents, FDA staff reviewers said coated stents do well to prevent arteries from reclosing, but also have a “small but significant risk” of clotting after a year, compared with bare metal ones.The Cleveland Clinic, a leading heart research hospital, analysed 14 drug-coated stent studies and found up to five times the relative risk of causing a blood clot than bare-metal stents.Key questions, FDA said, remain on whether more deaths or heart attacks occur with coated stents, and what the limits are in treating heart problems with the popular devices.Dr Donald Baim, chief scientist at Boston, said 30 years of progress in this area had reduced risk, not added it. “These are safe procedures that have reached a level we never dreamed of,” he said.Boston acknowledges the small risk of clotting - 1.3 per cent of Taxus patients versus 0.8 per cent bare-metal stents - but says death rates are not higher in these typically sick patients. In addition, it adds that coated stents’ prevention of repeat procedures is still double that of bare stents.One recommendation that could emerge from the meeting is that patients with coated stents should take blood-thinning drug Plavix for a longer period to prevent clots. This could be a boost for drugmakers Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of Plavix.Competitors such as US devicemakers Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic will be watching the review panel keenly for any sign that the FDA could require further safety data that could delay their new drug-coated stents.But the meeting might be best remembered as a signpost that medical devices - their new technology, cost and risks - are as much under the microscope as drugs."

According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate for second-quarter earnings now stands at 16.1 per cent, up from 14.8 per cent at the end of last week.Seventy per cent of companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings estimates.“That’s definitely a high number compared with what we’ve seen historically,” said John Butters, senior research analyst at Thomson.Health insurers made strong advances on different earnings reports.

71;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Mark Sellers: Wide-moat companies are the best to invest in;;"During the past few weeks, emerging market stocks and bonds and low-quality US stocks have been hammered. The amount of premium investors willing to pay to hedge their portfolios, as measured by the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX), has nearly doubled. Investors fear the global wave of cheap money and easy credit is about to end as central banks worldwide tighten purse strings.In such an environment, risky assets invariably sell off most violently. This reversion to the mean has only begun.There are a few things an investor can do:If you are a fund manager, the first option can put you out of business. In spite of their recent pullback, risky assets such as small-caps and emerging market stocks are still up over the past few years, and could fall a lot further before hitting bottom. Buying them now may mean fast, easy gains if markets rebound, but if things get worse, there will be big losses and investor redemptions.The third option is the safest, though it means locking in recent losses. But it is probably the best option for conservative investors.My firm is following the second option because many quality large-cap US companies are compelling bargains at current prices, especially on a risk-adjusted basis. These are companies that Warren Buffett would label as having “wide economic moats” (think of a moat around a castle; the wider it is, the more protected the castle). They generate high returns on invested capital; have relatively low debt levels; can buy back their own stock; have predictable earnings and cash flows; and can increase earnings even in a recession as they have pricing power and scant competition.Many of these high-quality companies are bargains today according to the following evidence.Exhibit One: Standard & Poor’s classifies stocks into groups based on quality, with the A+ category including the highest quality companies (think ADP or Berkshire Hathaway); the B category holding slightly lower-quality companies; C being even lower quality, etc. Through April 30 of this year, there has been a high inverse relationship between the quality of a company and its stock market performance.The A+ companies covered by S&P were up only about 1.5 per cent, B companies up more than this, and C companies up more than 15 per cent. Stodgy, “safe” stocks have been shunned in favor of risky stocks with higher earnings growth rates but much less certain prospects.Exhibit Two: Morningstar rates the more than 1,500 stocks it covers in terms of the size of their economic moats; either “no moat,” “narrow moat,” or “wide moat”. About 10 per cent are rated wide moat. These wide-moat companies include Home Depot, Amgen, General Electric, American Express, and Ebay. I worked at Morningstar and am familiar with the history and methodology of these ratings.After some quick research, I discovered there is a higher percentage of wide-moat stocks rated as “5 stars” (Morningstar’s “buy” rating) than at any time since October 2002.Exhibit Three: The financial newspaper Barron’s publishes weekly a list of stocks that have hit their 52-week low price the previous week. There have recently been more Morningstar wide-moat stocks hitting 52-week lows than at any time since I started tracking this metric. Several of these blue-chip stocks have declined as investors reallocated money into small caps, commodity companies, and emerging market issues. This performance chasing nearly always ends badly.Exhibit Four: My firm closely tracks a list of 15 mega-cap, high-quality companies. They include Berkshire Hathaway, Amgen, Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, GE, Microsoft and others. Since 1999 when they were at their peak valuations, these stocks have produced an average annual return of less than 1 per cent, including dividends. In the same time period, their operating cash flows have grown by more than 80 per cent, on average.Though there is no doubt many of these “nifty-15” stocks were overvalued during the 1990s stock market bubble, the pendulum seems to have swung back too far. Their cash flows and earnings have grown consistently every year since the bubble, yet their stock prices have gone nowhere.The best way to play an environment of rising risk premiums, without giving up any upside in a rally, is to hold a portfolio of very high-quality US large-cap stocks. My favorites include Medtronic, Ebay, Wrigley, Microsoft and Dell. All are down this year but have done well in the past two weeks as riskier assets have plummeted.Mark Sellers is a hedge fund manager with Sellers Capital in Chicagomsellers@sellerscapital.com"

An unexpectedly big drop in durable goods orders for April provided some relief for the market?s fears of higher interest rates. Data on new home sales were stronger than expected.?Durables are too volatile for it to be much of an influence,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ?I think the housing number is more important since even though there was a revision, that pace of new home sales is still very healthy, which is reassuring.?At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent, or 18.97 points, at 11,117.32. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 1.99 points, at 1,258.57, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent, or 10.41 points, to 2,169.17.Nymex crude fell $1.90 to $69.86, dragging down ConocoPhillips 2.5 per cent to $61.15, and Chevron down 0.9 per cent to $57.60.?There was a lot of volatility, and all of a sudden, crude just tumbled,? said Mr Pado.Gold dropped 4.3 per cent, denting mining stocks with Barrick Gold losing 3.4 per cent to $30.06, and Newmont Mining down 3.2 per cent to $49.53.Trading was, however, dominated by the poor market debut for Vonage, the internet telephony provider, after its initial public offering was priced on Tuesday night. Volume in the stock was close to double that of any other on the New York Stock Exchange. By the close, it was down 12.7 per cent at $14.85.Mastercard was still scheduled to make its stock market debut on Thursday in what would be the biggest US initial public offering in two years.Technology stocks were led higher by Microsoft, which gained 3.1 per cent to $23.50. The company has suffered a sharp sell-off in recent weeks, after announcements that it would delay the launch of its new Vista operating system and would spend more on internal investment.General Motors, the stricken carmaker, also continued its recent recovery, surging 8.3 per cent to $26.51, the biggest gainer on the Dow. Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock from ?neutral? to ?buy?.The weak durable goods order might have eased interest rate fears, but it made investors uncomfortable over Boeing which lost 3.3 per cent to $82.38.Medtronic, the medical devices manufacturer, was up 4.6 per cent at $50.17, thanks to an earnings report.Selling of exchange stocks continued, with the worst fall suffered by the InterContinental Exchange, which dropped 7.9 per cent to $53.87.

However, fears about inflationary pressures were eased after comments from Federal Reserve officials suggested the Fed might be close to ending its cycle of monetary tightening.At the end of a choppy session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 11,239.55. The S&P 500, supported by strength in energy stocks, closed
0.4 per cent higher at 1,311.56 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,359.75.Apple was a notable gainer. Shares in the iPod maker jumped nearly 10 per cent to $67.21 after it unveiled a new software patch that would allow users to run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on its Macintosh computers.Analysts at Credit Suisse compared the move with Apple’s decision to make iPods compatible with Windows in 2003 – a move that led to the widespread adoption of the portable music player.The news lifted chipmakers, with the Amex semiconductor index up 2.8 per cent. Intel, which now makes the chips used in Apple computers, was up 0.9 per cent at $19.48.Homebuilders were also in demand following news that mortgage applications went up by over 7 per cent last week, their strongest one-week gain in more than two months. The Philadelphia Housing index jumped 2.9 per cent, led by DR Horton’s 3.8 per cent advance to $35.14.Optimism over quarterly results was dealt an early blow after medical device maker St Jude Medical and hard drive maker Maxtor each cut their first-quarter earnings guidance.St Jude, which competes against Medtronic and Guidant in the lucrative market for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, a device that manages irregular heartbeats, said its disappointing outlook was due to a worse than expected slowdown in the US market. Its shares slumped 12.2 per cent to $36.25, while Medtronic dropped 1.6 per cent to $50.58 and Guidant fell 0.5 per cent to $76.73.Maxtor shares were off 1.7 per cent at $9.11.Elsewhere, Merrill Lynch downgraded Dow Jones from “neutral” to “sell”. The broker cited high valuation and added that the company was unlikely to be sold any time soon. Dow Jones’ shares fell 3.2 per cent to $37.85.Sears Holdings rose 4.7 per cent to $137.87 after the department store chain announced plans to repurchase an additional $500m shares, increasing its share buyback programme by
50 per cent.On the deals front, Liberty Global, the cable company, eased 0.2 per cent to to $21.01 after it sold has agreed to sell its Swedish operations for $427m to a private equity consortium comprising The Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners."
74;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2006-03-29T15:03:31Z;Guidant announces heart-stent quality problems;;Guidant, the medical-device maker that agreed to be taken over by Boston Scientific, on Wednesday announced it would suspend delivery of its Xience V heart stent and delay its release to European markets.The setback comes after a series of product recalls last summer led Johnson & Johnson, which had agreed to buy the company, to renegotiate the deal only to lose the battle over Guidant earlier this year to Boston.Guidant said that quality assurance concerns in about 1 per cent of its Xience V inventory led to the decision and also announced that it would stop enrolling patients in clinical trials for the device, which props open blood vessels.The move would result in a $15m charge on its first-quarter earnings, Guidant said. Release to European markets will be delayed until the third quarter.Boston Scientific’s $27bn takeover of Guidant is expected to close by April 18th after an occasionally graught battle between Boston and its much larger rival J&J in order to secure a leading position in the cardiac device market, which is seen as very lucrative by industry watchers.Medtronic, another medical-device maker, on Tuesday filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Guidant, alleging that its older Vision stent violates patents licensed by Medtronic.Guidant shares were fractionally lower at $78.35 in pre-market trading.
75;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2006-01-26T00:24:56Z;Boston wins $27bn battle for Guidant;;Boston Scientific on Wednesday emerged against the odds as the winner in the battle for Guidant, the US heart device maker.Boston clinched Guidant for $27bn after Johnson & Johnson, its larger rival, decided to walk away from the bidding rather than increase its final $24.2bn bid.The outcome of the takeover battle - one of the biggest in the US since the dotcom boom - will secure Boston?s future as an independent and powerful player in its sector, but could raise worries that it overpaid.J&J, on the other side, was outmanoeuvred by a rival with limited resources. It might be exposed to critics pointing to flawed negotiating tactics and a lack of determination in pursuing what had been billed as an important acquisition.Guidant?s fate had been in the balance until Tuesday night, when a deadline for J&J to counter Boston?s higher bid expired. After William Weldon, J&J?s chief executive, informed James Cornelius, his counterpart at Guidant, that he would take no action, Guidant was free to break its deal with J&J and sign a new one with Boston.J&J, which will now receive a $705m break-up fee, said raising its bid ?would not have been in the best interest of its shareholders?.Boston and J&J have been fighting over Guidant?s business in the $10bn per year market in implantable cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers. The bid battle has also shaken up the $5bn per year market for drug-coated coronary stents.Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories, St Jude Medical and J&J will be operating in an altered landscape.To secure Guidant?s approval, Boston entered a bid with a higher cash component and expanded protection for Guidant shareholders against a drop in its own share price. In addition, Guidant recruited Abbott to finance part of its offer with a loan and an agreement for Abbott to buy a stake in the combined company alongside some parts of Guidant to ease antitrust concerns.Defeat at the hands of Boston puts the spotlight on J&J?s next moves. J&J recently asked Citigroup to help it examine whether to make a formal bid for Serono, Europe?s largest biotechnology company, according to people familiar with the matter. However, there was no guarantee a bid would materialise, they cautioned.After pulling off one of the most significant opportunistic takeovers in recent history, Boston on Wednesday set out to close the deal as early as possible. Boston is hoping for regulators to sign off on the transaction before the end of March.Boston shares fell 1.9 per cent to $23.54 on Wednesday. Guidant shares, meanwhile, dropped 2 per cent to $75.19 and J&J?s fell 1.5 per cent to $58.50.
76;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2006-01-25T23:40:25Z;Strong results boost Abbott Laboratories;;Abbott Laboratories’ shares rose on Wednesday as the US medical products group, a winner in the bid battle over Guidant, reported strong fourth-quarter profits.Abbott is poised to become a strong competitor in the $5bn market for drug-coated coronary stents that help keep open closing arteries, after helping Boston Scientific in its bid for Guidant.Boston raised its price for Guidant to $27bn with the help of nearly $6bn in commitments from Abbott in exchange for rights and divestitures that will speed Abbott’s entry into the stent business. On Wednesday, Abbott reported a 13 per cent rise in quarterly profits excluding one-time items to $1.18bn, or 76 cents per share.Sales in the quarter rose 7 per cent to $6bn. But cost-cutting and strong sales of Humira, Abbott’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, helped boost profits.Humira’s sales rose 62 per cent in the fourth quarter to $441m, and 64 per cent last year to $1.4bn.Abbott also saw strong growth in Mobic, a painkiller more widely used after pain drugs cox-2 inhibitors came under scrutiny following Merck’s withdrawal of Vioxx.For the year Abbott earnings rose 10 per cent to $3.9bn, or $2.50 per share, excluding items.Sales increased 13.5 per cent to $22.3bn.Abbott is a diversified group with products ranging from pharmaceuticals, to diabetes monitoring kits, nutritional supplements, and cardiac and spinal devices.The group has been looking for acquisitions to bolster its medical device business – a fast-growing and lucrative market.Without its alliance in the Guidant deal, Abbott was set to be the fourth entrant into the drug-coated stent market trailing Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic.Abbott’s shares ended the session 5.3 per cent higher at $42.17 in New York.
77;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2006-01-17T23:04:30Z;Rivals in Guidant fight monitor its potential;;As the sums offered for Guidant keep rising, is the heart ruling the head in the battle for the maker of high-tech implantable medical devices?Boston Scientific has offered $27bn for Guidant, a company with $3.7bn in revenues expected this year, about $1bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a market value now standing at $25bn. The offer is higher than J&J’s sweetened $24.2bn agreement reached with Guidant last Friday.Almost forgotten in the later stages of the bid battle is Guidant’s damaging product recall last year. The problem found in nearly 100,000 products has hurt profits, harmed its reputation and is giving competitors a boost. J&J’s decision to renegotiate an agreed price, because of material adverse change, opened the door to Boston’s counterbid.Now, it appears, the attention is centred not on Guidant’s weaknesses, but on the huge growth potential of its technology.Its primary business – implantable heart devices that send electric signals to keep a heart beating properly – is the centrepiece of J&J and Boston’s interest. But Guidant also has significant expertise in stents, tiny props used to open closing coronary arteries. Both J&J and Boston covet Guidant’s products as an addition to their own important business in stents.Implantable devices to treat weakening, or sudden, heart conditions are a fast-growing technological innovation in medical care.The business enjoys the favourable winds of demographics. Ageing populations in the developed world, in general, and retiring baby boomers, in particular, could mean a solid market in such devices well into the future.A trio of US companies, Medtronic, Guidant and St Jude, dominate the global market for implantable heart rhythm devices. Medtronic leads with about 50 per cent market share, followed by Guidant with about 36 per cent and St Jude with the rest, according to UBS.The most important product for Guidant, and very important to the others as well, is the cardi implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Guidant also makes pacemakers and other implantable devices that can collect a patient’s heart data and transmit it remotely, allowing a technician or doctor to monitor their condition.An ICD is implanted just under the skin with wires connecting it to the heart. Electric pulses keep the heart beating in proper rhythm. And the device can also sense more serious heart problems, and deliver a significant electric shock to prevent death.The cost of a high-end ICD system is about $30,000. About three-quarters of the implants are in the US, with much of the rest in Europe.As the ICD market has matured, its growth has tempered in recent years. Analysts expect the market to increase 15-20 per cent per year over the next five years, and it is estimated to be a $9bn-a-year market in sales. This is down from growth of 30-50 per cent two years ago, when the devices entered the mainstream.Guidant also has expertise in stents, the tiny wire-mesh tubes inserted into an artery that is blocked by plaques to keep the blood flowing and prevent a heart attack.It led this market until J&J and Boston launched their drug-coated stents, which quickly dominated other products. The drug on the stent helps to prevent the artery from reclosing.The two companies dominate the worldwide stent market, estimated to be about $5bn a year. Competitors such as Medtronic and Abbott Laboratories, a US health products group, are entering this market. Boston and J&J are seeking to retain their leadership with new products, and Guidant has a drug-coated stent programmme that could help.But Guidant’s ICD business is the crown jewel for Boston and J&J, because it gives them a fast-growing business and diversifies their product portofolios. That diversification is key for both companies for different reasons.Boston is overly reliant on Taxus, its successful drug-coated stent. The stent accounts for about 44 per cent of Boston’s $6.3bn in annual revenues. Increased competition, some from J&J’s Cypher stent, could damp its growth.“If Boston fails to acquire Guidant, the company will be left with 44 per cent of revenue basically flat from 2005 to 2006,” said Mark Landy, analyst at Susquehanna Financial.Guidant would make implantable heart rhythm devices about 24 per cent of its sales, while stents would account for slightly less than 30 per cent.Boston touts a combination with Guidant as a fast-growing “pure-play” heart devices company that could rival industry leader Medtronic. It argues that shareholders might feel a conglomerate discount if Guidant were tucked into J&J, one of the world’s largest healthcare groups.“Our continued efforts to consummate a transaction with your company reflect our deep conviction that the strategic merits of this industry-transforming combination would create substantial value for your shareholders as well as ours,” Boston wrote to Guidant’s board.J&J’s pitch is that, with Guidant, it would be a dominant supermarket of medical devices ranging from orthopaedic joint implants, to stents to implantable defibrillators. The acquisition would diversify J&J away from pharmaceuticals, an activity among the company’s most profitable but which is weakening.The daring game over Guidant could also prompt another industry-changing reaction, Tao Levy, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said. A deal for St Jude might soon become a better option.
78;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;EU clears J&J’s $25.4bn bid for Guidant;;The European Commission on Thursday gave formal approval to Johnson & Johnson’s $25.4bn takeover bid for Guidant, removing an important obstacle to the creation of an expansive medical devices group.The US healthcare conglomerate will have to spin off three of its businesses to address the regulator’s competition concerns. J&J must sell its coronary stent delivery system, leaving it with the one from Guidant, which many experts consider better.But the remedies do not significantly change the companies’ important business in drug-coated stents – tubes inserted to prop open arteries and keep them from closing – because of new market competition.The decision by the European Union’s antitrust regulator came after a five-month investigation and in spite of initial concerns that the deal could be anti-competitive. Thursday’s move leaves the approval of the US Federal Trade Commission as the last regulatory hurdle for J&J, which expects that decision in October.The proposed cash and stock deal would expand J&J’s medical device business. However, Guidant’s recent recall of about 100,000 implantable heart devices cast a cloud over the bid’s current terms.On Thursday, J&J said it continued “to work with Guidant to understand and evaluate the impacts” of these recalls.The Commission said the groups had agreed to divest J&J’s European coronary stent delivery systems – angioplasty and guidewires to deliver the wire tube that props arteries open.Brussels found that the deal would not pose a threat to competition in the market for coronary drug-coated stents: “The investigation has revealed that, while Guidant would likely have been one of the key players in the market, other new entrants, primarily Medtronic and Abbott, will also be likely to exert a significant competitive constraint, compensating for the loss of competition resulting from J&J’s acquisition of Guidant.”
79;MDT;Medtronic Inc;2005-02-10T18:35:04Z;Galway gets to the heart of the matter;;"From the vantage point of the famous Galway racetrack, it is easy to see how this west of Ireland city is now described as one of Europe's leading industrial clusters.""Over there, we've got the world's biggest maker of cardiovascular stents,"" says Ian Quinn, who runs a family-owned business supplying the big multinationals with specialist parts. ""And on that side, we've got the second biggest.""Boston Scientific and Medtronic have Galway factories making stents, the tiny metal device which, when it was invented in the 1980s, revolutionised the treatment of coronary heart disease, replacing open-heart surgery with a minimally invasive technique that applies the principles of plumbing to let a surgeon clear furred-up arteries.Galway boasts three of the top four companies in this field, with Abbott the latest arrival, inheriting a stent plant as part of its 1995 takeover of Bio-Compatibles, a UK company.Together with local companies, there are now 28 medical devices companies in Galway, employing more than 5,000 people - 350 of whom are engaged in leading-edge research and development. Cluster theory, which was first described by Michael Porter in his book The Competitive Advantage of Nations, holds that when similar companies locate in the same place, they can achieve economies of scale without losing the flexibilities enjoyed by smaller organisations.Fifteen years ago, Digital, the US computer company, was Galway's biggest employer. It closed in 1993, moving to Scotland. ""Everyone said that when Digital closed, Galway was finished,"" says Bernard Collins, a well-known figure in Galway's medical devices industry. ""Quite the opposite was the case.""Many of the Digital engineers are now working for the big US medical device companies, which in the mid 1990s were starting to expand abroad, overcoming concerns about quality control and nervousness over the lack of protection for inventions.""What was happening was that many of the new medical device products were coming from Europe. Maybe it was the lower risk of litigation. Maybe doctors here are more adventurous. But US companies felt they had to capture that,"" says Mr Collins, who set up Boston Scientific's Galway operation in 1994, in a factory vacated by Digital, which a decade earlier had made tennis rackets for Wilson, the US sports equipment company.Creganna, Mr Quinn's company, was originally set up as a supplier to the local electronics industry. But in 1997, it was persuaded by Boston Scientific to start making catheters, the delivery device that carries the stent into position inside the heart. Now the world's largest catheter manufacturer, it has sales of €26m ($33m), employs 270 people in Galway and has a new design and development centre in Boston, Massachusetts.In the early days, one of the missing ingredients was the lack of R&D facilities. But in March last year, Boston Scientific's Galway facility was responsible for the launch of the company's latest innovation - a drug-coated stent that reduces unwanted patient reactions and inhibits the return of plaque to the arteries.Galway University works closely with the companies in areas such as materials testing. Last year, it was given a €19m government grant to set up a regenerative medicine institute, which is part funded by Medtronic and is looking to develop a new generation of devices that can deliver stem cells to rebuild damaged organs inside the body.Frank Barry, lured back from the US to run the institute, says his research scientists are in daily contact with R&D experts at the US company's Minnesota research laboratories.Roy Green, the university's dean of commerce, who is studying the Galway medical devices cluster, suggests that the Galway phenomenon is likely to continue. This is because the R&D operations of multinational companies need to be closer to their customers than to their corporate headquarters.""The days when you had one centre for R&D are over,"" he says. ""With the life cycles of medical devices products so short, it is vital to be close to your customers to keep ahead of competitors."""

Shares have stumbled since Friday, confounding bullish investors' hopes of a sustained rally in the run up to Christmas.Michael Driscoll, block trader at Bear Stearns, said he was still optimistic that this year's post-election rally could continue until the end of the year.Hopes for a renewed bounce have been bolstered by falling oil prices. Oil futures resumed their slide on Tuesday, closing down $1.52 at $41.46, following a rally on Monday that reversed a week of sharp decline.Optimism over oil was kept in check by government figures showing that business productivity in the third quarter had grown more slowly than expected. The US Labor Department said non-farm productivity had grown at a 1.8 per cent annual rate from July to September, a two-year low.In an otherwise slow week for economic news, instability in the Middle East and concerns about oil supplies ahead of a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday continued to weigh on sentiment.Concerns that Opec might decide to cut oil production were compounded by official US data showing that average oil output by Opec members fell by 400,000 barrels per day in November.Christmas fortunes will hinge in part on next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which must decide whether to raise interest rates amid this month's flurry of sometimes conflicting news about the state of the US economy.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said that the dithering on Wall Street was due in part to concerns over interest rates.""We've had a tremendous rally, up almost 700 points from the bottom,"" he said. ""People are really afraid to buy stocks because they are worried about the Fed [raising rates].""Johnson & Johnson fell 2.3 per cent to $60.43 following reports that the healthcare group was in advanced merger talks with Guidant, a leading maker of stents used to combat cardiovascular disease. Shares in Guidant jumped 5.3 per cent to $72.41 on news of the deal, which would strengthen both groups' positions against rival stent makers Medtronic and Boston Scientific.

The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the largest of the companies targeted.Elsewhere on the corporate news front, the shares of Applied Materials were 1.8 per cent higher at $17.65 after the chipmaker announced its best financial year since 2000 but warned that momentum was likely to peter out.Meanwhile Intel begged to differ as its chief executive officer said he saw ""improved performance"" for the first half of the next year. Shares put on 2 per cent to $24.80.News of a possible mad-cow disease case sent McDonald's shares 1.5 per cent lower to $29.95, alongside Tyson Foods, a beef processing company, which gave up 1.7 per cent to $16.63.The fallout from the global withdrawal of Merck's Vioxx drug threatened to spread to other drugs groups as a regulatory official told lawmakers in Congress other similar drugs needed to be monitored.

The main focus was on monthly employment data due out on Friday.The few market watchers who were not on summer vacation attributed the late rise in the Tuesday session to the so-called “window dressing” of portfolios by fundmanagers at the end of August.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eased less than 0.1 per cent to 10,168.83 while the S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,105.92. The technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,850.41.Blue-chip stocks were stoic in the face of news that manufacturing activity slowed in August slightly more than expected. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 59 last month, from 62 in June, to a level that still shows expansion for the industrial sector.While some economists said the data suggest growth in manufacturing has peaked, others noted that they still pointed to an expansion in industrial employment last month.Stocks also appeared to shrug off a sharp rebound in crude oil futures, focusing instead on their other obsession the jobs report due on Friday. The job creation data are expected to drive trading once investors return from their holidays next week. Amid evidence of slowing growth in the US, economists hope for a rebound in hiring after two disappointing months for job creation.Not only are the jobs data expected to set the tone of trading on Wall Street but also that of economic debate between President George W.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 0.9 per cent.In the auto sector Ford Motor eased 1.5 per cent to $13.90 after it reported a 13 per cent decline in sales during August and announced a 6.8 per cent cut in fourth-quarter production. General Motors, which announced a 7 per cent drop in sales and its own output cut of 6.8 per cent, closed 0.2 per cent lower at $41.21.Declining auto sales follow news of declining consumer confidence and cast a pall over hopes that US consumers would continue to spend at a time when US businesses show no willingness to invest even though they have the capital to do so.Elsewhere, the shares of Forest Laboratories fell 8.4 per cent to $41.98 after the company said its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease failed to produce results in clinical trials.Meanwhile, Boston Scientific shares added 7.1 per cent to $38.28 after the maker of medical devices said it regained market share in the wake of a recall of its Taxus heart device.Among its competitors, Medtronic added 0.4 per cent to $49.99 and Guidant put on 3.1 per cent to $61.66.In the internet sector Ebay rose 1.3 per cent to $87.63 after the online auctioneer announced it had bought the part of its South Korean affiliate it did not already own for about $530m in a bid to expand its presence in Asia.Verizon Communications shares moved 0.6 per cent higher to $39.50 amid reports by US media that the company was selling its Canadian phone directory business to Bain Capital for more than $1bn.
