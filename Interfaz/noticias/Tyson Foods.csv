0;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-12-09T22:12:45Z;Tyson Foods signs deal for beef plant in Kazakhstan;US meat producer hopes to boost sales to China, Russia and the Middle East;Tyson Foods has revealed plans to build a beef plant in Kazakhstan, giving the largest US meat company better access to booming markets nearby in China and other areas of Asia.An agreement signed on Monday to collaborate with the government of Kazakhstan is part of the country’s efforts to raise a global livestock industry on its grassy steppe. Tyson hopes to boost its international business, which accounts for 3 per cent of its $42.4bn in annual revenue.The proposed 2,000 head-per-day slaughterhouse envisaged by the agreement would add an overseas beef plant to Tyson’s more than 20,000 head-per-day US business. Talks have been under way for months, with Tyson executives travelling to Kazakhstan and country officials visiting Tyson’s headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, the company said.The Financial Times first reported Tyson’s interest in investing in Kazakhstan in May.Noel White, Tyson chief executive, said more than 98 per cent of demand growth for protein would come from outside the US, notably in Asia.“This initiative is to help satisfy that growth in demand that we see over the course of the next 10-plus years,” he said in an interview on Monday.Kazakhstan ranks ninth among nations in land area and 63rd in population with about 19m people. It shares a border with China, a market of 1.4bn people where demand for foreign meat has soared since African swine fever wiped out more than half its own pig herd.China has imposed 47 per cent tariffs on US beef as part of the protracted trade war with Washington, according to the US Meat Export Federation, putting US supplies at a disadvantage to imports from Brazil and Australia.Mr White said neither swine fever nor retaliatory tariffs were factors in the planned investment in Kazakhstan, however. Instead, Kazakhstan has sufficient water and land to breed livestock and good rail and road access to markets across the continent, he said.“It’s well-situated geographically with China, Russia, the Middle East. And they also have a transportation and distribution network going into central Europe,” he said.Mr White signed the agreement at Tyson headquarters alongside Askar Mamin, the Kazakh prime minister, and Yerkin Tatishev of Kusto Group, a Singapore-based company that already has beef production in Kazakhstan. The three parties would invest capital into the project, Mr White said, declining to provide more details.Mr Mamin said in a statement: “Tyson is a world-class company with the expertise necessary to help Kazakhstan jump-start the transformation of our agro-protein capabilities and help us create an ecosystem that will increase our beef herd size and establish conditions to support thousands of new high-quality jobs in the country.”
1;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-09-03T21:10:25Z;Tyson Foods cuts annual profit outlook amid ‘short-term challenges’;Volatility in commodities market and food safety initiatives contribute to dimmer view;Tyson Foods has lowered its forecast for full-year earnings, citing a range of “short-term challenges” including a recent fire at a beef processing plant and volatility in the commodities market.The company on Tuesday said a reversal of a gain on mark to market grain derivatives recognised in its fiscal third quarter, the implementation of food safety initiatives and slower than expected operational improvements in its chicken business also contributed to the dimmer view.Tyson, the largest US meatpacking company, now expects to book earnings of $5.30 to $5.70 a share on an adjusted basis, adding that it continues to “monitor potentially adverse mark-to-market movements and other volatilities”. It previously anticipated earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.10 for fiscal 2019, which ends in September. Analysts had been looking for $5.94 a share.Shares in Tyson fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading. The stock has gained 74.7 per cent year-to-date, based on its closing price on Tuesday.Noel White, chief executive of Tyson, said the company does not expect some of its current challenges to repeat themselves and continues to expect better performance in fiscal 2020.“Our volumes are strong in the back-to-school season while our case-ready beef and pork business continues to grow,” Mr White said.The cut to guidance follows an upbeat third-quarter earnings report that helped propel the stock to new record highs last month. Tyson, the company behind Hillshire Farms meats and Ball Park franks, reported an 8.3 per cent increase in sales for the third quarter that ended in June, while net income rose to $676m from $541m.
2;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-06-13T19:39:14Z;Meat alternatives/Tyson: the root ahead;Market is becoming increasingly crowded;Nothing like a hipster vegetarian to prompt resentment. Two weeks into Beyond Meat’s remarkable run as public company, America’s largest meat producer, Tyson Foods, unveiled its own plans for alternative meat. Its Raised and Rooted brand will start by selling, among other things, nuggets composed of pea protein, egg white, flaxseed and bamboo fibre. Yum.Beyond Meat’s debut has been meteoric — its shares remain nearly 6 times above its IPO price. But that does not make the upstart a Tesla to Tyson’s Ford or General Motors. Traditional meat is doing just fine. Tyson shares are up a third in two years. Tyson’s modest valuation suggests Wall Street remains concerned not just about long-term consumption of traditional proteins, but also more immediate challenges for meat processors.The world meat market exceeds $1tn. Tyson has pork, beef and chicken operations as well as a prepared food unit. A growing US economy and a rapidly prospering developing world have spurred meat consumption in recent years. But profitability for the likes of Tyson can swing sharply based on commodity prices for inputs that include feedcorn.Analysts often value Tyson on a sum-of-the-parts basis as pork, beef, and chicken have different profitability and growth profiles. On a blended basis, Tyson trades at just 12 times forward net earnings. For comparison, Beyond Meat trades at an enterprise value ($8bn) to 2020 estimated revenue of more than 20 times.Tyson was an early investor in Beyond Meat but it sold its shares prior to the listing. There is no shortage of alternative protein start-ups. Jefferies estimates that based on the alternative milk market, newfangled meat could be a $35bn market of which only about 1 per cent has been tapped. There is plenty of room for challengers but the question is what competitive advantages Tyson has in its organic effort. It is easy enough to become a vegetarian. The tricky bit is sticking with it.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
3;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-06-13T11:14:34Z;Tyson Foods launches fightback against non-meat start-ups;America’s biggest meat producer to sell ‘alternative protein’ nuggets and blended burgers;Tyson Foods, the biggest US meat producer, is launching its own non-meat nuggets and blended burgers in the biggest challenge yet to the start-ups that have driven a once niche dietary trend into the mainstream.The push by Arkansas-based Tyson, whose offerings will be sold under the “Raised & Rooted” brand, comes as shares in Beyond Meat have soared fivefold since its initial public offering last month as investors clamour for exposure to the sector.“We remain firmly committed to our growing traditional meat business and expect to be a market leader in alternative protein, which is experiencing double-digit growth and could someday be a billion-dollar business for our company,” said Noel White, chief executive of Tyson.In addition to pea protein, the nuggets will be made with egg white, flaxseed and bamboo fibre.Tyson, which was an early investor in Beyond Meat before selling its stake ahead of the IPO, is trying to muscle in on the trend for non-meat alternatives that has been fuelled by consumers’ concerns over the environment, animal welfare and the desire for healthier diets. Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods and Nestlé have already made a push into alternative proteins.Analysts at Barclays believe that meat substitutes, including plant-based and lab-grown protein, could grab a 10 per cent share of the $1.4tn world meat market.The excitement and hype over the sector has also been fanned by the initial success of Impossible Burger’s sales at Burger King outlets in St Louis, Missouri. The fast-food chain began offering them in April and sales have outpaced the group’s national average by 30 per cent, according to Earnest Research. It plans to roll out the plant-based burger across the rest of the US by the end of the year.McDonald’s offers Nestle’s products in Germany, but Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said investors were expecting a potential partnership between the fast-food giant and Beyond Meat.“This has been on investors’ radars especially as Donald Thompson, former CEO of McDonald’s from 2012 to 2015, has been an investor in Beyond Meat through his VC firm, Cleveland Avenue, and he currently sits on Beyond Meat’s board,” she noted. Shares in Beyond Meat, which floated at $25 a share, surged to almost $190 earlier this month, before falling back to about the $140 level.Tyson’s nuggets will be available in US retailers in late summer and the blended burgers later this year. The company holds stakes in a number of alternative protein start-ups, including mushroom-based protein producer MycoTechnology and cell-based meat companies Memphis Meats and Future Meat Technologies.
4;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-05-23T04:00:26Z;Tyson eyes multibillion-dollar bet on Kazakh beef as route to China;America’s largest meat processor in talks to build plant as tariffs bite into exports;Tyson Foods is in talks over a multibillion-dollar investment in Kazakhstan beef production as a back door into China, allowing the US meat company to dodge high tariffs on American agricultural goods.The US is the world’s largest beef producer, but sales to China have been disadvantaged since Beijing imposed a 25 per cent retaliatory tariff in July last year, bringing the total levy to 37 per cent. The value of US beef exports to China fell 17 per cent year on year in the first quarter.Three people with knowledge of the discussions said that Tyson was in negotiations to set up a beef processing plant, as part of the Kazakh government’s push to attract investment by selling itself as an agricultural powerhouse on China’s border. Chinese tariffs on Kazakh meat are 12 per cent.Tyson, the largest US meat packer, has discussed an initial investment of about $200m in the plant, one of the people said. It would form part of a potential total investment that could run into several billion dollars, with ambitions to scale up production to 5m tonnes of beef a year. The US is expected to produce 12.4m tonnes of beef this year versus 480,000 tonnes in Kazakhstan, according to US government data.Liz Croston, a Tyson spokeswoman, told the Financial Times that it was “not unusual for us to consider various international opportunities” as part of the company’s efforts to expand globally, adding: “We have visited Kazakhstan and have interest in the nation’s future food production efforts. However, we have not formalised plans for a project there.”The Arkansas-based company generated $4.8bn — or 12 per cent — of its sales last year from outside the US, and executives have prioritised expansion in international markets.Tyson recently agreed a $340m deal to acquire chicken plants in Thailand, the Netherlands and the UK sold by BRF of Brazil. Stewart Glendinning, chief financial officer, told a conference last week that he expected 90 per cent of the company’s growth to come from outside the US in the next five years.China’s demand for foreign pork, beef, chicken and fish meat is forecast to shoot higher as African swine fever removes as many as 200m animals from its pig herd, the world’s largest.“We are seeing increased shipments not only from the US, but other parts of the world to fill that gap,” Noel White, Tyson’s chief executive, said at the same conference.Any investment from Tyson would be a major boost for Kazakhstan’s efforts to upgrade its agriculture industry, which is large and well-located between major consumers China, India and Europe, but inefficient and underfunded.The vast country is one of the world’s biggest wheat exporters but outdated technology and farming techniques mean yields are low. The average hectare of Kazakh livestock farmland yields just 0.5 animals, against as many as six in countries such as the US or Australia.Kazakhstan has invested to improve the genetics of its cattle herd. Thousands of head of Angus and Hereford breeds were flown in on Boeing 747 aircraft earlier this decade from the US, Canada and Australia, a rancher familiar with the shipments said.Last year the country launched an initiative to double beef and lamb production within a decade, in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture.Additional reporting by Emiko Terazono in London
5;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-05-18T04:00:26Z;Cashew foie gras? Big Food jumps on ‘plant-based’ bandwagon;Boom in meat and dairy substitutes sets up ‘battle for the centre of the plate’;First came the vegetarians, then the vegans, followed by a bewildering array of food tribes from veggievores, flexitarians and meat reducers to pescatarians and lacto-vegetarians. If the profusion of terms for people who have cut their meat or dairy intake is anything to go by, a change is afoot that is set to sweep through the global food industry as once-niche dietary movements join the mainstream.Fast-food chain Burger King has partnered with a “foodtech” start-up, and McDonald’s with Nestlé, to put meat-free burgers on their menus. Pret A Manger is considering a surge in its roll-out of vegetarian outlets as it looks into buying UK sandwich rival Eat.But at the other end of the supply chain, Big Food is getting in on the act as the emergence of plant-based substitutes opens the door for meat market disruption. “This is a battle for the centre of the plate,” said Justin Sherrard, a strategist at Rabobank, referring to the western practice of building meals around a piece of protein with vegetables on the side.The prize will be huge if imitation meat matches adoption levels of milk product alternatives such as soy yoghurt and almond milk, which account for 13 per cent of the American dairy market. It is a $35bn opportunity in the US alone, according to newly listed producer Beyond Meat, given the country’s $270bn market for animal-based food. Packaged food producers, burdened with anaemic growth in segments from drinks to sweets, have jumped on the plant-based bandwagon. Market leaders including Danone, Nestlé and Unilever are investing heavily in acquisitions and internal product development.Laggards are dipping their toes. Kraft-Heinz, for example, is investing in start-ups via its corporate venture capital arm and making vegan variants of some of its products. Even traditional meat producers, such as US-based Tyson Foods and Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods, are diversifying into plant-based offerings to remain relevant with consumers. “Plant-based is not a threat,” said Wayne England, who leads Nestlé’s food strategy. “On the contrary, it’s a great opportunity for us. Many of our existing brands can play much more in this space than they do today, so we’re accelerating that shift, and there is also space for new brands.” Nestlé aims to reach SFr1bn ($1bn) in sales from plant-based products within a decade. While small in the context of its total annual sales of SFr91.4bn, Mr England said the sector is a priority. The company has a lot riding on the recent launch in Europe of Garden Gourmet’s Incredible burger, which is designed to cook and “bleed” like real meat, with the US to follow in the autumn. In a sign of the times, Nestlé has put its Herta cold-cuts brand up for sale — but is keeping hold of the unit’s vegetarian and dough products. From cashew “foie gras” to fake shrimp made of algae, a plethora of alternative protein products are hitting supermarket shelves. They appeal to consumers for different reasons, industry executives say, with some wanting to reduce their meat consumption for health reasons and others concerned about animal welfare and agriculture’s contribution to climate change. France’s Danone, known for Activia yoghurt and Evian water, has gone the furthest in putting plant-based at the centre of its strategy. Emmanuel Faber, chief executive, has promised to triple sales of plant-based products to €5bn by 2025, which would account for a fifth of group revenue at current levels. But some investors have questioned whether Danone overpaid for its $12.5bn acquisition of WhiteWave, an upmarket US producer of alternative milks in 2016. As Big Food rushes in, it faces stiff competition from a new breed of start-ups that have raced ahead to launch plant-based meats they claim look, taste and feel like the real thing. Flush with venture capital funding, they have turned to technology, analysing the molecular structure of foods and seeking to reverse-engineer versions using plant proteins. Beyond Meat, whose market capitalisation has more than tripled to $5.5bn in the two weeks since its initial public offering, and rival Impossible Foods have big ambitions to convert even the most committed carnivores to their cause. “We can win on taste, we can win on nutrition and if we can get the price of this to be lower than the cost of animal protein, very few consumers are going to be like, nah, I’m not going to do it,” said chief executive Ethan Brown of Beyond Meat. Not only are the disrupters innovating on the product side, they are rapidly creating new brands using digital marketing and partnerships with restaurants. Big food companies, which can struggle to create new brands, often rely on acquisitions to bring new ones onboard. In a sign of the branding savvy of the start-ups, Impossible Foods’ distribution deal with Burger King in the US is for the “Impossible Whopper”, giving the new brand double-billing with the fast-food chain. In contrast, when McDonald’s chose Nestlé’s Garden Gourmet Incredible Burger for sale in Germany, it coined its own name, the “Big Vegan TS”, with the foodmaker’s branding nowhere to be seen in stores. Aside from the quality of the new protein substitutes, how they are marketed will determine whether they become truly mass-market or remain limited to the margins of motivated vegetarians and vegans. The positioning of the product in stores influences sales, with new brands such as Beyond Meat pushing to be placed in the meat section rather than separate chilled cabinets alongside the vegetarian and vegan options. Elio Leoni Sceti, whose investment company recently backed NotCo, a Chile-based start-up that uses machine learning to create vegetarian replicas of meat and dairy, believes new brands have an edge on the marketing side because they are not held back by old habits. “The new consumer looks at the consequences of consumption and believes that health and beauty come from within,” said one industry veteran who used to run Birds Eye owner Iglo. “They’re less convinced by the functional-based arguments that food companies are used to making, like less sugar or fewer calories. This is not the way that consumers used to make decisions so the old guard are flummoxed.” For big meat producers, the risk that people will gradually reduce their consumption poses a more existential threat, although with global demand still strong, such a change does not seem imminent. Addressing investors at a New York conference this week, Tyson chief executive Noel White explained the meat group’s plan to launch a plant-based product this summer. The largest meatpacker in the US owned a stake in Beyond Meat before selling ahead of the IPO. “It came to the point in time where we decided that we were going to enter that market ourselves, and do it in a meaningful way,” he said. He added that the product could eventually deliver $1bn in revenue, and played down the capital investment required, saying the project would draw on existing supply chain and distribution resources. Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods, which bought two plant-based brands in 2017 for $270m, announced this year that it would spend $310m constructing a plant-based product facility in Indiana. Dan Curtin, who heads Greenleaf, the company’s plant-based business, played down the idea that alternative meats will eat into meat sales, saying the substitutes were “additive”. “We don’t see this as a replacement. People want options,” he said. Despite these initial forays, most large meat producers are not betting as much on plant-based foods as their consumer goods counterparts. That is partly because of continued growth in meat demand, as well as a reluctance to enter an increasingly crowded market without a distinct offering. But the landscape is changing fast. The meat makers, said Mr Sherrard, “need to realise” that if they are not careful, consumer food companies could eat their lunch.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New YorkA hot dog made headlines in London this month. It looked like any other pork frankfurter in a bun — except it was made from seeds. And had a £13 price tag.The Moving Mountains hot dog, which was 12 months and nearly £1m in development, claims to be a “world first”: a plant-based sausage that tastes like real pork. The company’s founder, Simeon van der Molen, said that in a blind taste test three-quarters of meat-eaters were fooled. The hot dog will sell in restaurants for between £10 and £13.The product is one of the latest examples of how restaurants and supermarkets are catering to the rapidly growing number of “flexitarians” — consumers who like meat but want to eat less of it.But one sticking point is price. Given the general impression that vegetables are cheaper than meat, some chains have faced a backlash from customers expecting more of a saving.In January, UK pub company Young’s came under fire for pricing a cauliflower steak at £14 — the same as its Aberdeen Angus beef version. The company defended the price, saying both dishes were “premium quality”, but under pressure from social media users it pulled it from the menu.British upmarket food and clothing retailer Marks and Spencer similarly encountered criticism from customers last year when it launched a “cauliflower steak”. The product, made of two slices of the vegetable, with a dressing, was initially priced at £2, double the cost of an entire cauliflower. M&S swiftly pulled it from its food range.Chantelle Nicholson, group operations director for chef Marcus Wareing’s restaurants, said profit margins on vegan dishes were not much better than for meat.“In terms of cost of ingredients it may be cheaper . . . but anything that is plant-based has a huge amount more work in it. Everything on that plate is made from scratch,” she said.The plant-based tasting menu at Tredwells, one of the group’s London restaurants, costs £39 for five courses, compared with £45 for meat. A meat-free Beyond Meat burger at UK chain Honest is £2 more than the beef version, such is the cost of buying it in.British bakery chain Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll this year that became a Twitter sensation. The snack is 5p more expensive than its meaty counterpart, which the company said was “reflective of the core ingredients”.Still, there are signs some consumers are willing to pay for meat-free alternatives.Moving Mountains last year launched its bleeding meat-free burger, which costs about £10. Sales have soared from 500 a week to half a million a month.Overall £8bn was spent on meat in the UK in the year to April 2019, a 2 per cent decrease on the year before, according to Nielsen data. Spending on meat alternatives increased by nearly a fifth to £315.2m.Cardlytics, which monitors spending data from 2.5m UK consumers, found in April that the amount spent in burger and chicken restaurants fell by more than 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively in 2018.Happy plant-based eating experience may require salt, sugar and flavourings / From Arnold Holtzman, Glen Mills, PA, US
6;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-05-06T20:55:35Z;Tyson Foods chief warns African swine fever could reach US ;Warning comes after disease moved rapidly through world’s largest pig herd in China;The head of meatpacking company Tyson Foods has warned the “threat is real” that African swine fever could enter the US for the first time, a nightmare scenario for pork exporters.African swine fever, fatal to pigs but harmless to humans, was discovered in China last August and rapidly moved through the world’s largest pig herd.Deaths from the disease and culling are likely to cut China’s inventory by more than 100m animals — more than the entire hog inventory in the US. The looming scarcity in China is expected to reshape international trade in meats, with exporters in Europe, Brazil, Australia and the US, including Tyson, poised to benefit. “This is an unusual, perhaps unprecedented, time for the protein industry,” Noel White, Tyson’s chief executive, said on a conference call while reporting results on Monday. “In my 39 years in the business, I’ve never seen an event that has the potential to change global protein production and consumption patterns as African swine fever does.”New York-listed Tyson is the largest meat packer in the US, slaughtering hundreds of thousands of cattle and pigs and tens of millions of chickens every week. Shares of Tyson and other meat suppliers such as JBS of Brazil have soared this year as the toll of African swine fever in eastern Asia became known. For the quarter ended March 30, Tyson reported adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, down 6 per cent from the same period last year, but 5 cents ahead of consensus estimates.Management maintained an annual outlook for $43bn in sales and adjusted earnings of $5.75-$6.10 per share, projecting that new demand coming in response to the outbreak of African swine fever would arrive late this fiscal year or in the next one. Mr White estimated about 150m-200m hogs have died in China because of the disease, reducing global protein supplies by about 5 per cent.“It's going to benefit all three species: beef, pork and poultry,” Mr White said of the impact on alternative meat sources. Tyson’s shares closed up 2.6 per cent at $77.05, the highest level since January 2018.However, he spoke in grave terms about the risk that the disease could spread to the 74.3m pigs on US farms, which would immediately shut off American pork exports. “I think the threat is real. I do think there is a distinct possibility it could come to the United States,” Mr White said. The virus has no treatment or vaccine and can survive up to a year in blood, faeces and meat, making it difficult to suppress. North American authorities and farm groups have mobilised to prevent the disease from entering the country with stepped-up inspections at ports of entry and other measures. US sales of pork to China have faced a 62 per cent tariff since last July, imposed by Beijing in retaliation for US duties. China has banned American chicken since a 2015 avian influenza outbreak in the US. Hopes for greater meat exports have risen this spring as negotiators seemed to edge closer to a trade deal. Tyson in March received US government approval to export pork to China from two slaughterhouses in the towns of Perry and Storm Lake, Iowa, “to make sure we’re positioned to export pork to Chinese customers again,” the company said. The optimism over US meat exports was clouded by US President Donald Trump’s new threat to raise tariffs on all Chinese goods to 25 per cent this week. In response, lean hogs futures, which track a key input for Tyson, fell by the daily limit of 3 cents to 89.75 cents per lb Monday in Chicago. 
7;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-04-24T15:40:58Z;Tyson sells stake in Beyond Meat ahead of IPO;The maker of plant-based meat plans to go public in May;Tyson Foods, the US meat producer, has exited its investment in Beyond Meat, the alternative protein company which is due to go public at the start of May.Beyond Meat on Monday said it is aiming to raise as much as $184m with an initial public offering next month that will value it at more than $1bn. Tyson had a 6.5 per cent stake in the California-based company before its sale.Tyson said it was “pleased” with its investment in Beyond Meat and had decided the time was right to exit. “Beyond Meat provided an early opportunity for Tyson Ventures to invest in plant-based protein products that many consumers are seeking. We wish the leadership of Beyond Meat all the best.”The stake sale comes as the meat company is planning to launch an alternative protein product later this year.The company said it remained committed to providing alternative protein to consumers, adding: “We plan to launch an alternative protein product soon with market testing anticipated this summer.”Tyson also invested in lab-grown meat start-ups Memphis Meats and Future Meat Technologies.Beyond Meat’s flotation comes as consumers are increasingly opting to be vegan, vegetarian and ‘flexitarian’ — eating meat and fish occasionally. Demand growth for plant-based meat and dairy products has been far higher than ‘real’ animal meat and dairy products in Europe and the US.Tyson’s exit was first reported by Axios. Beyond Meat could not be reached for comment.
8;TSN;Tyson Foods;2019-03-24T05:00:24Z;Abattoir economics: Trump’s immigration policy tests Iowa;Meat industry needs migrant labour at a time Washington’s rhetoric is hostile to outsiders;North-west Iowa is “the number one pork-producing district in all the United States of America,” Steve King, its US congressman, boasted to constituents last week. A few days earlier, after meeting pork lobbyists, he posted a photo of himself smiling with a man dressed as a bacon rasher.Mr King is better known for his hardline views on immigration. The Republican has provoked outrage with statements such as “we can’t restore our civilisation with somebody else’s babies” and “cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end,” which he tweeted beside a photo of himself with rightwing European politicians Frauke Petry, the former leader of Alternative for Germany, and Geert Wilders, the Dutch populist. He backs President Donald Trump’s border wall against illegal immigrants.Being friendly to the state’s $36.7bn pork industry and hostile to immigrants is becoming an awkward position in Iowa, where 23m hogs massively outnumber 3m humans. With unemployment at 2.4 per cent, the lowest in the nation, pork processors cannot find enough local people to cut up pigs.Just under half of Iowa’s meatpacking jobs were held by immigrants in 2017, according to data analysed by the Migration Policy Institute. “If you have a close-by population of Americans who don’t want [the jobs], you have to fill them somehow,” says Ron Prestage, a senior executive at Prestage Farms.Expansion in the US pork industry is running at record levels, says Steve Meyer, an economist at Kerns and Associates. On March 4, the first hogs walked to the kill floor of a $325m plant that Prestage built outside Eagle Grove, Iowa. The aim is to slaughter 10,000 animals a day once the first shift has its full complement of 920 people, says Jere Null, chief executive of Prestage’s Iowa foods division.It is the second new pork plant in two years to open in Mr King’s sparsely settled district of grain fields and ethanol refineries. In the old stockyards town of Sioux City, Iowa, Seaboard Triumph Foods’ $335m facility is still hundreds short of the 1,800 production workers it needs to reach capacity of 20,400 pigs a day, executives say.The labour squeeze will worsen as the US poultry industry adds seven plants nationally in the next two years, according to Watt Global Media. To sell more $4.99 rotisserie chickens, the retailer Costco Wholesale is hiring 800 workers to dispatch 2m birds a week at a new complex west of Iowa in Nebraska, says Jessica Kolterman of Costco’s Lincoln Premium Poultry division. Construction is on track despite catastrophic floods in the area last week.The plants are a big bet on the US as the world’s low-cost supplier of animal protein. American meat consumption will average 220.8lb per person in 2019, nearing a peak reached 15 years ago, says Shayle Shagam, economist at the US department of agriculture. Demand for meat in developing countries is irrepressible: last year, US pork exports fell just 0.5 per cent despite retaliatory tariffs in China and Mexico, while broiler chicken exports rose 4 per cent and beef exports shattered records.A solid US economy — national unemployment fell to 3.8 per cent in February — is creating tight labour markets all over the country. But meat is in a class of its own for lack of career appeal. The disassembly line is bloody, smelly, repetitive and loud. “No matter how much you pay, work in a hog plant involves killing animals and cutting them into parts. Those are not skills that schools teach to prepare students for ‘jobs of the future’,” Mr Meyer, the economist, wrote in an industry magazine.Production employees must “constantly reach”, “constantly bend” and “constantly stand on concrete” for up to 12 hours a day, Seaboard Triumph job adverts say. The working week is often six days long, says George Solo, vice-president of human resources. In annual sales from the production, processing and slaughtering of pigs in the state of IowaAn hour is the average wage for production workers in one of Iowa’s many meat packing plants — the state’s minimum wage is $7.25Unemployment in Iowa is the lowest in the country, adding to the tight jobs market. The national average is 3.8%. Meat processing plants proliferate throughout the state.Pork and beef slaughter workers record occupational illnesses — such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — 13 times more often than average, according to government data. Turnover of jobs at the largest meat and poultry plants almost doubled last year to 2-2.5 per cent a week, sacrificing hundreds of millions of dollars of profit due to the cost of replacing line workers, estimates Rabobank animal protein analyst Christine McCracken. Employers are thus scraping the bottom of the labour pool. Seaboard Triumph has recruited in towns stunned by factory closures. It approached Puerto Ricans displaced by hurricanes. “Hey, if you’re looking for a place to be for a year or two, Iowa’s a good place and we don’t have hurricanes,” says Mark Porter, who was Seaboard Triumph’s plant chief operating officer until he lost his job in a management restructuring last month. The company hired J & L Staffing & Recruiting, a Sioux City employment agency, to find workers. Among them was a man with a face marked by tattoos who waited in J & L’s office one afternoon to be driven to Seaboard Triumph’s rendering department, which processes offal, blood, bone and fat, to begin his shift. “I just got out of prison,” he says when asked his previous career. Automation has taken over some tasks. Powerful robotic arms slice open carcasses. Jets of flame singe off hair and vacuums suck away blood. Yet manual labour remains crucial. At Prestage’s plants a person with a knife still makes the lethal incision. About 400 workers will staff its cutting floor, wearing coats in the refrigerated air as they use a combination of hand tools and machines to attack shoulders, midsections and hams rattling down three conveyor belts. Starting pay for production work is about $16 an hour, better than Iowa’s minimum wage of $7.25. The arrival of Seaboard Triumph and Prestage forced other packers to raise wages, even at plants covered by union contracts. Along a roadway in Eagle Grove, two billboards sharing a pole advertised rival pay packages at Prestage and Tyson Foods, the largest US meatpacker, which owns a pork plant 70 miles away in Storm Lake, Iowa. “We’re not beating the unemployment rolls. We’re going straight after people that are working. We want quality people,” Mr Null says. “But everybody I hire creates a deficit for somebody else.”The tight labour market has revived the debate over the effects of immigrant labour on wages in low-skilled jobs. The Trump administration wants to halt what it calls “chain migration”, when an immigrant can sponsor family members, arguing it depresses Americans’ pay. Meatpacking, requiring no English language skills and based in far-flung towns, is an option for recent immigrants who are mobile, says Jeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Yet the foreign labour supply is not increasing.The state department issued 534,000 immigrant visas to people outside the US in fiscal year 2018, down from a recent peak of 618,000, and fewer still have been issued in 2019. Incoming refugees — long a source of industrial labour — dropped from 85,000 in 2016 to 23,000 in 2018, as the Trump administration lowered a federal cap on arrivals, Ms Batalova says.Government crackdowns on companies have also sent a clear message not to hire illegal immigrants. In November, one of Seaboard Triumph’s two owners, Seaboard Corporation, agreed a $1m fine to settle claims that its Oklahoma plant used unauthorised workers. “Many of these actions, particularly in the Midwest, have been focused on meatpacking because of the nature of their workforce,” says Amy Peck, an immigration lawyer at the Jackson Lewis firm in Omaha. “It just becomes more difficult for employers to hire.” The 10.7m illegal immigrants in the US in 2016 was the lowest figure in more than a decade, according to the Pew Research Center. But Mr King told constituents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday that the number was now closer to 22m. He has argued that the US already has plenty of potential workers in big cities. “You’ve got employers in either [political] party that are huge beneficiaries of cheap labour and they lobby hard for that,” he said.His office did not respond to interview requests. Suzan Stewart, chair of the Republican party of Woodbury County, which includes Sioux City, says she believes her congressman supports legal immigration. She refused to address his more controversial comments.“There’s just a crying need for workers,” says Ms Stewart, a retired lawyer. “I think it’s a goal of all of us, both business and political people, that this would be filled by legal immigration.”The expansion in the pork industry is already causing economic ripples. A short walk from Mr King’s Sioux City office, former Tyson Foods worker Tewodros Worku has opened an Ethiopian-style coffee house in anticipation of a Seaboard Triumph boom.Among his customers is Asfaw Negash, 47, who emigrated from Ethiopia four years ago and found a job at a pork plant in Ottumwa, Iowa owned by JBS, the world’s largest meat processor. A year ago, he picked up a knife on the Seaboard Triumph ham line. In February he quit, exasperated. “I was covering three guys’ work by myself,” he says, speaking in Amharic. “I complained, but they didn’t do anything.” He has no concern about finding a new job, pointing to an ice-cream factory, an industrial-scale bakery and Tyson’s beef plant in the region. “It’s easy here in Sioux City,” he says. Tyson raised hourly pay in its pork and beef plants by double digits in the past two years, says Dan Heffernan, vice-president of human resource operations. He believes that “money isn’t the answer” to retaining employees. “If they feel safe, if they feel that they’re needed and feel that they’re wanted, they’ll stay. Diversity is what makes our company great,” he says. With 30 languages spoken inside its plants, Tyson caters to foreign-born workers. Some initiatives are small, such as placing their home-country flags in its cafeterias, Mr Heffernan says. Others are more substantial, like on-site English and US citizenship classes. Eagle Grove, a modest town dominated by grain elevators, had seen its population slowly decline over the past five decades to about 3,400. That is now changing. Its schools have built classrooms for 200 new students, houses are being hammered together on its fringes, and the local Mexican grocery is moving to a bigger building to accommodate an influx of Prestage pork workers. Jaime Venegas, the grocery manager, says several of the people filling openings at Prestage are his customers, originally from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. “They are hard workers,” he says, standing next to three red phones used to wire cash south of the border.The Prestage plant opened five weeks after the end of the longest US government shutdown in history, caused by a stand-off over Mr Trump’s proposed border wall. As of mid-March less than half of its first shift had been hired.“It seems like today you either take the one extreme position of anything goes, or you take a position of nothing goes,” Mr Null says on a tour of his plant. “We just need a controlled situation of legal immigration.“Employers can’t win in this situation,” he adds, “any more than the immigrants can.”Harmless to humans, but deadly to pigs, African swine fever and its spread across eastern Asia is causing growing concern among US pork suppliers. Since the virus was discovered in China last year, the country has lost at least 15-20 per cent of its herd, according to Rabobank.US producers should be salivating at the chance to cover the shortfall. But two issues are tempering that enthusiasm. The first is very real: the 62 per cent tariff that China imposed on US pork last year has priced most cuts out of the world’s largest market, handing the advantage to competing exporters such as Brazil, Canada and Europe.The other issue is more speculative: the threat posed by ASF should it cross the ocean and end up in American hog barns.The virus has no treatment, no vaccine and can survive up to a year in blood, faeces and meat — even salted ham, says Jack Shere, deputy administrator at the US department of agriculture’s animal and plant health inspection service. It can spread through contact with bodily fluids and ticks.“Say we get that disease in the United States. It would be an immediate shutdown of all our exports,” Dr Shere, a veterinarian, told a conference outside Washington recently.The US government has intensified efforts to keep ASF out of the country, for example adding border beagle teams to sniff for agricultural products. Agents at a port in New Jersey seized a substantial amount of pork smuggled from China earlier this month.Any shutdown in US pork exports would likely last until officials cordoned off infected regions and reopened sales from other areas, says Erin Borror, economist at the US Meat Export Federation. Even that would be “devastating”, as “the halt to try to sort things out would shock the markets,” she adds.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-11-13T18:05:24Z;Tyson Foods to raise prices to offset sting from Trump tariffs;;Tyson Foods, one of the biggest food producers in the world, said it will raise prices across its business segments in an effort to claw back higher costs associated with tariffs, freight and labour.Those higher costs and uncertainty around the Trump administration’s tariffs add to the already challenging market dynamic the Arkansas-based company is experiencing, with strong demand for beef being offset by an oversupply of pork and chicken that have weighed on sales prices for those white meats.Tyson, which is the biggest US meat producer by sales, said in a regulatory filing accompanying its fourth-quarter results that it would “pursue recovery of increased costs related to tariffs, freight and labor through pricing”, without providing details as to which products would be affected and by how much.That will see Tyson pull alongside numerous companies in the food & beverage industry, including Mondelez, General Mills and Nestlé, which have raised prices this year to combat rising input costs.The company owns brands including chicken-focused Tyson, Jimmy Dean sausages and Sara Lee sliced meats. In August, Tyson said it would buy Keystone Foods from Brazil’s Marfrig Global Foods for $2.16bn in cash in an effort to boost its international reach and portfolio of value-added meat products, like beef patties and chicken nuggets.Tyson’s beef segment, which represents nearly 40 per cent of total sales, was the standout division in the fourth quarter ended September 30. Thanks to stronger demand and increased exports, sales rose 2.8 per cent from a year ago to $3.9bn, with a 3.4 per cent rise in volumes more than offsetting a 0.6 per cent decline in average selling price.Sales of pork were down year-on-year, hit by both a decline in volumes and prices. Chicken sales edged higher as volumes from business acquisitions offset a drop in prices that has been exacerbated by cheaper competing proteins, such as beef and pork.All up, total sales fell 1.4 per cent to $10bn in the fourth quarter, missing the $10.26bn forecast by analysts in a survey by Thomson Reuters. However, record net profit of $537m, or $1.47 a share, was up 36 per cent from a year ago and ahead of Wall Street estimates.The company guided towards adjusted earnings of $5.75 to $6.10 a share in fiscal 2019, down a touch from a record $6.16 a share in 2018 and compared with analyst forecasts for $6.04 a share.Shares reacted poorly to the fourth-quarter sales miss and 2019 outlook, pushing shares 6.3 per cent lower to a three-month low and year-to-date losses to nearly 29 per cent.
11;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-09-17T12:25:52Z;Tyson CEO to step down after less than 2 years;;Tom Hayes is stepping down as chief executive of Tyson Foods after less than two years on the job, the US’s biggest meat producer by sales said on Monday.The news makes Tyson the latest major US food producer to shake up its top ranks as the industry struggles to do battle with rising price pressure and trade tariff fallout. Mr Hayes’s departure also comes just seven weeks after the meat producer issued a surprise profit warning.Tyson said in a statement Mr Hayes is stepping down for “personal reasons”. He will be replaced by Noel White, who was formerly group president of Tyson’s beef, pork and international division, beginning September 30.“It is a very difficult decision to leave Tyson Foods, but after careful consideration and discussions with my family and the board, I know it is the right thing to do,” said Mr Hayes.Tyson stunned the market in July by downgrading its earnings outlook by more than one-tenth. At the time, it blamed fallout from the Trump administration’s recently-imposed tariffs and a glut of beef and pork in the domestic market for the move.Mr Hayes’s exit continues a recent trend of management turnover at major US food and beverage groups. Companies including PepsiCo, Coke, Starbucks, Campbell Soup, Kellogg, General Mills, Hershey and Mondelez have all replaced their chief executives since the start of 2017.Shares in Tyson, down 22 per cent so far this year, fell 2.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
12;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Sanderson Farms results miss the mark as US meat glut grows;;Sanderson Farms saw sales and profit tumble in its fiscal third quarter as the poultry producer battles with low chicken prices, a domestic glut of beef and pork, and rising feed costs.The disappointing result, which failed to match market expectations, echoes the concerns of industry peers that have come under pressure from the effects of the US’s trade war with its allies and a surplus of meat.Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium products prompted the likes of China and Mexico to impose their own levies on US exports such as soyabeans and pork, as well as other products like motorcycles and bourbon.The tariffs have helped push down prices for some meats inside the US, which in turn has pressured margins for food producers.Joe Sanderson, the company’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings statement the “significant counter-seasonal weakness” of the results was “due, at least in part, to a lack of chicken promotions at both food service and retail grocery stores and an ample supply of competing proteins.”The company said jumbo boneless breast meat prices were down almost 27 per cent from a year ago, while the average market price of bulk leg quarters was down 12 per cent and jumbo wing prices were down by 35.4 per cent.Recent data from the US Department of Agriculture showed domestic stockpiles of frozen red meat and poultry topped 2.5bn pounds in July for the second straight month, with volumes rising in recent months as the imposition of tariffs on US agricultural products by the likes of China and Mexico cause growing quantities of protein to go unsold.US stockpiles of chicken hit a record 888m pounds in June. And among stockpiles of red meat, those of pork ribs, veal and “other” red meat are at or near records this summer.Those forces prompted Tyson Foods last month to downgrade its earnings outlook and also contributed to Hormel Foods this morning to cut its sales guidance for the fiscal year.Mr Sanderson said: “The USDA expects chicken production growth of 2.3 per cent during calendar 2018, which alone shouldn’t be a burdensome supply number. However, chicken will continue to compete against an abundant domestic supply of protein, which may continue to pressure market prices.”In Sanderson’s third quarter ended July 31, net sales fell 9 per cent from a year ago to $852.4m. That was below the forecast among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for $865.7m.Net income of $11.5m, or 50 cents a share, tumbled from $115.8m a year ago, due in part to an 11 per cent jump in costs and expenses. Analysts forecast earnings of $1.75 a share.Sanderson also said feed costs had risen 1.5 cents a pound — or 5.8 per cent — from a year ago. Prices paid for corn and soyabean meal — primary feed ingredients — were up 4.3 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 2017.Sanderson shares were up 1.3 per cent in morning trade on Thursday, but had been down by more than 4 per cent during pre-market trade following the release of the results.
13;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-08-20T11:41:34Z;Tyson Foods to buy food service industry supplier Keystone;US group will pay $2.2bn for Brazilian-owned meat business;Tyson Foods unveiled on Monday a deal to buy a major supplier to the food services industry as it bolsters its international business and portfolio of value-added meat products, like chicken nuggets.Arkansas-based Tyson said it will pay $2.16bn in cash to buy Keystone Foods from Brazil’s Marfrig Global Foods.The pact includes the acquisition of six processing plants and one research and development facility in the US, and eight plants and three R&D centres in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia.Keystone, based in Pennsylvania, provides products like chicken, beef, fish and pork to major fast food and fast casual chains. It also makes value-added products, like chicken wings, beef patties and breaded fish fillets.“This acquisition will expand our international presence and value-added production capabilities and help us deliver more value to our food service customers,” said Tyson chief executive Tom Hayes.He added:Keystone provides a significant foundation for international growth with its in-country operations, sales and distribution network in high growth markets in the Asia Pacific region as well as exports to key markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Keystone, which employs 11,000 workers, generated sales of $2.5bn in the 12 months to June 30.
14;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tyson beefs up profit while trade worries loom;;A muscular performance from its beef division helped Tyson Foods top Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly profit, but the US meat giant behind such brands as Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages continued to flag potential fallout from the Trump administration’s trade disputes — as well as the fast-food burger wars. The company’s shares were up 3.35 per cent to $59.62 on Monday, putting them on track for their best one-day gain since March, after reporting results for the fiscal third quarter.For the three months to end of June, total sales rose to $10.05bn from $9.85bn a year ago, while net income attributable to the company came in at $541m, or $1.47 a share, up from $447m, or $1.21 a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts have been looking for earnings per share of $1.40 and revenue of $10.28bn, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its biggest division, beef, saw a 2.7 per cent increase in volume, as did prepared foods, which helped to offset a 2.1 per cent decline in pork and an 0.1 per cent contraction in its second-largest segment, chicken. Tom Hayes, the company’s chief executive, acknowledged “stiff headwinds” facing chicken and pork. Chicken demand has fallen thanks to a confluence of lower prices for other proteins, including beef and pork, as well as reduced promotional activity for poultry-based items in the fast-food world , which has instead focused more on beef hamburgers, Mr Hayes told investors on a call Monday. He said he hoped that would turn around when school begins again in the fall, “when we expect chicken will return to play a bigger role with key customers.” Pork, meanwhile, has been at the centre of the Trump administration’s trade disputes, with both Mexico and China slapping new duties on US imports earlier this year. On the other side, beef benefited from lower livestock prices and growing demand. The results come on the heels of Tyson’s move last week to warn of lower full-year profits amid retaliatory tariffs against US agriculture and a growing surplus of meat. Mr Hayes hit some of those same cautionary notes on Monday’s earnings call, saying that “tariff and trade noise” continued to weigh on its outlook. Nevertheless, he added: “Despite the current trade issues global protein demand continues to grow. Our products are moving in the export markets albeit at lower values. We’re working to strengthen our existing relationships certain markets, and build inroads into new markets.”After rising 31.44 per cent last year, Tyson shares are up 33 per cent year-to-date including Monday’s gain. 
15;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-07-30T17:36:12Z;Trade war and US meat glut hits Tyson Foods;Shares tumble after profit margins squeezed as Mexico and China impose tariffs;Retaliatory tariffs against US agriculture and a building surplus of meat have taken a toll on Tyson Foods, leading the purveyor of beef, pork and chicken to warn of lower profits.Imports of US pork have been singled out for new tariffs by Mexico and China in response to duties imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs have helped push down prices for some meats inside the US, pressuring profit margins for processors such as Tyson.“The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,” said Tom Hayes, Tyson’s chief executive.Shares of the Arkansas-based company were down 6.8 per cent to $59.22 at midday in New York on Monday. The company said it expected adjusted earnings per share of $5.70-$6.00 for its fiscal year ending in September, a reduction of more than 10 per cent from previous guidance.221lbsUS supply of red meat and poultry in 2018 per personThe revision comes as the US market is piled high with meat. Enabled by cheap animal feed, farmers and ranchers have sharply increased herds. In the first half of the year, US commercial red meat production totalled 26.3bn pounds, up 4 per cent from the same period a year before, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Supplies of red meat and poultry will hover at 221lb per capita in the US this year, the highest in more than a decade, said John Nalivka, president of Sterling Marketing, a livestock consultancy.That supply has intensified competition on supermarket shelves.Attracted by relatively low prices, consumers are buying more beef and pork and choosing less chicken — historically Tyson’s largest source of operating profit.The company cited “sluggish domestic chicken demand” due to prices of other proteins as a primary cause of the lower guidance. It said its beef business continued to perform well.Of Tyson’s $38.3bn in sales in fiscal 2017, $3.9bn came from US exports.Pork processors’ profit margins turned negative in early June as Mexico imposed a 20 per cent duty on US pork exports. China imposed new pork duties in April. In July, it raised them and slapped new tariffs on beef.Since late March the price of October-delivered lean hogs futures has declined by nearly a quarter to 51 cents per pound, the lowest in the life of the contract.Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, warned of the effects of expanding capacity in the meat industry.“With competitors opening up new chicken and pork processing facilities right in the middle of such an uncertain time for international trade, we fear that weak pricing in the protein markets will continue to pressure Tyson’s margins” into fiscal 2019, he said.
16;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-07-30T14:16:41Z;Tyson Foods blames tariffs and frozen meat glut for profit downgrade;;Tyson Foods, the US’s biggest meat producer by sales, has blamed fallout from the Trump administration’s recently-imposed tariffs and a glut of beef and pork in the domestic market for its decision to downgrade its earnings outlook by more than one-tenth.The company had already been facing rising commodity and shipping costs, but has come under additional pressure from the US’s trading partners, such as China and Mexico, which retaliated against Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium products from such countries by imposing their own levies on US exports ranging from soyabeans and motorcycles to bourbon and pork.US pork producers now face tariffs of 62 per cent for exports to China and 20 per cent for exports to Mexico — the US’s top customer by volume — putting their meats at a disadvantage in the world market.“The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,” said Tom Hayes, Tyson’s chief executive in a statement on Monday morning.Mr Hayes also highlighted that chicken sales volumes and pricing were sluggish owing to an “abundance of relatively low-priced beef and pork on the market” that was prompting customers to turn away from the white meat.The most recent data from the US Department of Agriculture showed stockpiles of frozen red meat and poultry topped 2.5bn pounds in June, with volumes rising in recent months as the imposition of tariffs cause growing volumes of protein to go unsold.In particular, stockpiles of frozen chicken are at a record high 888.6m pounds, with drumsticks, paws and feet in record quantities. Among the 1.25bn pounds of frozen red meat, stockpiles of pork ribs, veal and “other” red meat are at record highs. Stocks of cheese, driven by categories other than American and Swiss, are also at a record.Mr Hayes said the company was working to mitigate these various pressures, but its fourth quarter, which began in July, is “off to a slower than expected start driven primarily by market related factors.”Tyson, which reports third-quarter earnings on August 6, said it expects full year adjusted earnings of $5.70 to $6 a share, down from a previous forecast of $6.55 to $6.70.Shares were down 5.4 per cent to a one-year low of $60.10 on Monday and have fallen by a little more than a quarter this year. Shares in rival food producers were down, too, with Hormel Foods off 2.2 per cent, Pilgrim’s Pride down 1.2 per cent and Sanderson Farms 1.3 per cent lower.
17;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-06-13T04:00:28Z;Fake meat’s brand identity is too squishy;Plant-based burgers struggle to match the sensory pleasures of the original;"Meat Is Murder was the second album by The Smiths in 1985, when menus were simpler. These days, meat is muddled — the hamburger in a supermarket aisle or the chicken nugget in a fast-food restaurant may have come from an animal, be made of fungal protein, or soon be grown in a laboratory.All beef was once, as the cowboys of the US Cattlemen’s Association euphemistically argue, “the flesh of a bovine animal” that was “born, raised and harvested in the traditional manner”. Most still is, but alternatives are multiplying, from plant-based burgers sold next to traditional ones in supermarkets, to KFC’s plan to develop vegetarian deep-fried “chicken” in the UK.Innovation is welcome. Vegetarian alternatives such as soy protein and Quorn have been around for a long time without seriously threatening the love consumers feel for the taste and texture of meat. Despite health concerns, global consumption of animal flesh has grown fourfold in the past 50 years, and Americans eat 50bn burgers a year, with developing countries catching up.Constant meat eating is not only unhealthy but terrible for the environment. Food production is responsible for more than a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions and growing feed for livestock accounts for a quarter of water use. Ruminant animals such as cows and sheep occupy swaths of farmland and emit vast amounts of methane before being turned into meat.But when something is popular, there is usually a reason. Meat-eating is an efficient habit — the amino acids in meat proteins are highly nutritious — and good meat is delicious. That is why companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat in the US aim to match it with what David Lee, Impossible’s chief operating officer, calls “plant based, crave-able meat”.As research for writing this column, I went to have a lunch of “meatless meatballs” at Leon, the UK healthy fast-food chain, which is following the trend for meat alternatives. Leon describes its “meatballs”, made with aubergine, black olive and rosemary, in tomato sauce with vegan garlic aioli, as “the future of fast food”. If so, the future tastes good but is squishy.This is the difficulty with meat substitutes — they struggle to be as good as the original and its sensory pleasures. New products such as the Impossible burger, which is sold in US chains such as Umami Burger, are better at matching the “mouthfeel” of meat and even “bleed” juices when rare, but it is simpler and cheaper to have the real thing.A second, connected, problem is authenticity. It is no wonder that US cowboys and German schnitzel makers are becoming upset at the invasion of supermarket meat aisles by analogues. The more similar these become to the thing itself, the more confused shoppers will be; despite the flurry of branding from “clean meat” to “cultured meat”, they are fake meat.There is a paradox. Many young adult consumers are drawn to authenticity and are suspicious of processed foods. Among more affluent and health conscious meat and dairy eaters, there is a craze for traceability — knowing from exactly which farm your cheese or sausages came. Yet the same consumers are more likely to be vegetarian or at least flexitarian, wanting to limit their attachment to meat eating.Plant-based burgers are healthier than the originals — they contain no cholesterol, hormones or antibiotics. But the place to which one traces an Impossible burger is a factory in Oakland, California where yeast protein is fermented and enriched with other ingredients such as iron-rich leghemoglobin to provide taste. That sounds like processed food to me.These burgers at least derive from plants. The next substitutes will be even more ambiguous, being grown in laboratories from animal cells by companies such as Just and Memphis Meats. US meat packing companies including Tyson Foods are investing in this technology, along with the entrepreneurs Richard Branson and Bill Gates, in an effort to make cows redundant.Attaching labels to such substances will be tricky for the authorities. The European Court of Justice had a big enough challenge last year when it ruled that terms such as milk and cream could only be used for dairy products, allowing exceptions for coconut milk and lait d’amande in French but not almond milk. What is beef that does not come from a cow?One can nudge meat-eating consumers temporarily but the products will only endure with their own identities, not by trying to be something else. Mr Lee says bullishly that Impossible’s next burger will taste better than beef, and healthier variations of old products can work.

Facilities in North Carolina and Michigan, as well as a sales office in Canada, will be included.Sally Grimes, group president of prepared foods at Tyson, said: “These are great assets with outstanding team members; however, we’re focused on expanding Tyson Foods’ leadership position in protein. We believe these brands and facilities will do well as part of Kohlberg, which has extensive experience buying and growing businesses.”Kohlberg said that CJ Fraleigh, who left Sara Lee’s North American division in 2011, would serve as executive chairman.Tyson said last year it would explore a sale of three non-protein businesses in order to focus on its core offerings like beef and chicken. It said in March it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore a sale of its pizza crust business."

Rising fuel prices and a tighter labour market are also running up the amount companies are having to shell over for transport and logistics.All this is coming at a time when many of the companies are struggling with declining sales of their mainstay brands. This in turn makes it harder for them to pass on the price increases to bargain savvy consumers, especially given the ever growing number of new entrants in the food and snacks market.Anthony DiSilvestro, Campbell’s chief financial officer said in a call with analysts, that he is expecting costs for everything from carrots to cardboard packaging to go up this year.“We’re seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items,” he said. “For example, we expect double digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that driven or all of it’s driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.”“We’re also expecting higher inflation on wheat and vegetables and resins and corrugated,” he added. “So this is a meaningful shift in the inflation outlook.”
20;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-05-07T16:00:43Z;Cost pressures eat into Tyson Foods profits;;Add Tyson Foods to the list of American companies struggling with rising cost pressures.The US meat processing and packaged food group has become the latest to be hit by higher transport and commodity costs, reporting on Monday fiscal second-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.The company took in $9.77bn in sales for the three months to end of March, a 7.6 per cent rise from the prior-year period but below the $9.87bn analysts had forecast.The sales gain was driven was mainly by contributions from AdvancePierre Foods, the ready-meal maker Tyson acquired last year for $4.2bn.However, that was not enough to prevent net income from sliding more than 7 per cent to $315m during the quarter as margins were squeezed across its beef, pork, chicken businesses.Over the past several years, Tyson, like other meat producers, has been reaping the benefits of cheap feed and fuel prices, as well as strong demand for meat both in the US and overseas.However, the recent rally in grain prices is once again pushing up feed prices, while a strengthening US economy and higher oil prices are driving up long-distance trucking and railroad freight rates. An improving job market has also made it harder for Tyson to find workers for its meat processing plants.The cost pressures are underscored by the sharp rise in Tyson’s cost of sales. The gauge rose more than $700m during the March quarter and is up nearly $1.8bn for the first half of the year.Tyson said it now expects freight costs to go up by $250m and chicken feed costs to rise by $100m for the fiscal 2018 year.“Increased freight costs affected all four segments and had a net impact of about $0.14 per share for the quarter,” said chief executive Tom Hayes during a call with analysts. “We were climbing the hill, the grade steepened and now we’re estimating a full-year impact to be roughly $250 million.”While Tyson said it plans to pass some of the higher input costs on to its customers, it also told analysts that full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance will probably come in at the lower end of its $6.55-$6.70 range.“Yes, we are maintaining our guidance,” said Mr Hayes. “I do believe that we’ll be sort of on that low end of the range given what we’ve seen. The costs come in at on freight, and that is all baked into the forecast but it is causing us to say we’re closer to the lower end of the range.”Shares in Tyson, down 17 per cent so far this year, were up 0.3 per cent at $67.24 in midday trading.Photo source: Getty Images
21;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-04-06T14:59:04Z;Soft commodities slide again on beefed-up tariff threat;;Donald Trump’s plan to impose an additional $100bn in tariffs on imports from China is weighing on soft commodities and farm equipment makers.The move by the US president, announced via a White House statement on Thursday night, escalates the tit-for-tat trade battle between the two countries. China responded on Friday saying it was “not afraid to fight a trade war” and that it was prepared to adopt “comprehensive countermeasures.”Soft commodities have endured wild swings this week, suffering sharp intraday drops on Wednesday after China unveiled plans for tariffs on over 100 US products - although the likes of feeder cattle and lean hog futures recovered on the day thanks to a bout of short-covering.But concerns that Beijing could now further target US agricultural farm goods in retaliation prompted soyabean futures for May delivery to slide two-thirds of 1 per cent to $10.235 a bushel on Friday. Corn futures were down one-third of 1 per cent at $3.885 a pound. Live cattle futures were down 1.3 per cent while lean hogs were 0.1 per cent lower.Among US agricultural stocks, tractor maker Deere & Co was down 1.2 per cent, while Caterpillar was down 1.6 per cent. DowDuPont, which counts agrochemicals and seeds as businesses alongside its plastics and chemicals units, was off 1.1 per cent. Monsanto was up 0.3 per centFood producers were faring better, with many analysts surmising tariff action could depress soft commodity prices, thereby driving down the cost of inputs for such companies. Tyson Foods was up 1 per cent, Spam-maker Hormel gained 1.3 per cent and Pilgrim’s Pride, the US’s largest chick producer, was up 1.1 per cent.Among the commodity trading and food processing companies, Bunge was up 0.7 per cent and Archer Daniels Midlands added 0.1 per cent.The S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.1 per cent in mid-morning trade.
22;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-04-04T15:11:19Z;US meat producers rise with soyabeans under pressure;;The US-China trade beef is turning up the heat on the meat sector.After the two economies traded tit-for-tat tariff plans, US meat producers were trudging higher on a fall in the price of soyabeans, one of the grains used to fatten up livestock destined for slaughter (China has targeted US exports of the crop for potential retaliatory tariffs.)•Hormel shares are up 4.9 per cent to $35.91•Pilgrim’s Pride is up 2.5 per cent to $24.72•Tyson Foods shares up 2.24 per cent to $71.50•Sanderson Farms shares up 1.4 per cent to $119.30On the flip side, cattle futures were sliding lower as China took aim at US beef exports as well.CME live cattle futures were down 1.45 per cent to $110.35, briefly touching $110.10 earlier in the session, their lowest point since October, according to Thomson Reuters data.
23;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-04-02T17:11:19Z;China pork duties give US meat producers a roasting;;It’s not just technology stocks that are getting pummeled on Monday.Shares in leading US meat processors are also feeling the market’s ire, with investors fleeing the sector after China raised tariffs on imports of American pork products to 25 per cent in retaliation against President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs.Tyson Foods, the country’s biggest meat producer by market value, fell as much as 6.3 per cent to $68.56. The decline marks the stock’s biggest one-day drop in nearly 11 months and takes the shares to their lowest level in over six months.Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam, dropped 2.6 per cent to $33.43 while smaller players such as Pilgrim’s Pride and Sanderson Farms were down 1.4 per cent at $24.26 and 1.1 per cent to $117.73 respectively.Tim Ramey, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said in a report on Monday that in the medium term, it would be very difficult for meat producers to change the course of production meaningfully to adjust for external shocks such as the China tariffs.“We expect the Chinese tariff to cause meat supplies in the US to back up meaningfully as the market has to be cleared,” he said in the report.Alongside pork, Beijing also imposed or raised tariffs on 127 other US products — including a variety of fruits, nuts and wine — in a blow to American farmers given that China is the second-biggest customer for US agricultural exports after Canada.Commodities traders Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge also fell amid a broader markets sell off, with both companies shedding 2.2 per cent.(Photo: Reuters)
24;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-03-27T21:12:05Z;Tyson Foods weighs sale of pizza crust business;;Tyson Foods is considering slicing off a “pizza” its food business as it focuses in on its key protein offerings.Tyson, one of the world’s largest food companies, said on Tuesday evening it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it explore a sale of its pizza crust business, TNT Crust, which offers partly baked, flat bread and self-rising crusts, as well as two plants in Green Bay, Wisconsin.Tyson intends to hold on to its tortilla production from those facilities, it said. Sally Grimes, group president of Tyson prepared foods, said in a statement:“We’re focused on maximising the full potential of our core business, and this divestiture will help pave the way for growth in our protein brands. We believe a potential buyer will see the value of the pizza crust business as a whole, including the TNT Crust brand, the facilities, and the talented team members, and will be able to focus on its future.”While revenue from its pizza crust business was not broken out in its latest annual report, it is part of the company’s prepared foods segment, which pulled in $7.8bn in revenue altogether in 2017, according to its annual report.Tyson shares, which were up 31.4 per cent in 2017, are down nearly 9 per cent thus far in 2018. They advanced 0.55 per cent in after-hours trading.
25;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-02-08T14:31:17Z;Tyson profits beefed up by strong global meat demand;‘Demand for protein continues to rise, and we’re well-positioned’;America’s love affair with meat helped Tyson Foods blow past expectations for its fiscal first-quarter results.The meat giant, which sold more than $30bn worth of beef, chicken and pork last year, saw its shares climb more than 4 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday as it also raised its earnings guidance for the year.Sales for the last three months of 2017 came in at $10.2bn, a 11.4 per cent rise from the prior year period and ahead of forecasts of $9.9bn.The sales gains were driven by demand for products across its four main divisions. Growth at its beef, pork, chicken and prepared food units were boosted by stronger consumer spending in the US, better pricing power, and increased exports.“Demand for protein continues to rise, and we’re well-positioned to take advantage of that opportunity,” said Tom Hayes, chief executive.Net income attributable to the company surged to $1.63bn, or $4.40 per diluted share, from $594m, or $1.59 a share, a year ago. The jump was largely because of savings stemming from the recent changes to US corporate tax rates. Stripping those out, adjusted earnings were $1.81, still easily topping estimates for $1.50 a share.Tyson said as a result of the expected tax gains, it now forecasts full year adjusted earnings of between $6.55-$6.70 a share, up from previous guidance of $5.70-$5.85 and sharply higher than the $5.31 reported in 2017. Sales for the fiscal year are expected to grow between 6 and 7 per cent to $41bn.The Arkansas-based meat processor also said it planned to pay its workforce more than $100m in cash bonuses as a result of the tax gains.The stock, up 12.2 per cent over the past 12 months, gained 4.2 per cent in pre-market trade.
26;TSN;Tyson Foods;2018-01-31T17:40:27Z;Chicken suppliers clipped by latest antitrust claims;;Major US chicken suppliers including Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride are seeing investors fly the coop on Wednesday after two major US food distributors became the latest to accuse them of participating in a years-long conspiracy to reduce the supply and raise prices for chickens.Shares of Arkansas-based Tyson Foods were down 4.36 per cent to $75.45, heading for their biggest one-day drop since May, while Pilgrim’s Pride, headquartered in Colorado, dropped 3.8 per cent to $28.49.The declines come after the Wall Street Journal reported that US Foods and Sysco – two major US food distributors – became the latest to serve up allegations of anti-competitive in the market for broiler chickens, which account for nearly all of the chicken meat sold in the US, in lawsuits filed Tuesday in federal court in Illinois.The claims echo those brought in recent civil litigation by distributors and farmers and other purchasers accusing the major US chicken producers of colluding for years to drive prices higher, including through alleged manipulation of the Georgia Dock, a widely used index for wholesale chickens that was subsequently suspended.Tyson has previously disclosed that it was being investigated by Florida’s attorney general in connection with the allegations. A probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ended without any recommendation of an enforcement action against Tyson, the company disclosed in a letter last year.A Tyson spokesman said in a statement: “Follow-on complaints like these are common in antitrust litigation. Such complaints do not change our position that the claims are unfounded. We will continue to vigorously defend our company.”A Pilgrim’s spokesman said: “Pilgrim’s believes the case is completely without merit. We look forward to defending our interests through the appropriate legal process.”Photo source: Getty Images
27;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Tyson tops estimates on strong global meat demand;;Freer-spending Americans and strong demand for meat from a growing global middle class helped Tyson Foods deliver another set of forecast-busting results for its fiscal fourth quarter.Shares in the US meat processor jumped 3 per cent in pre-market trading as investors cheered a 10.8 per cent rise in sales to $10.1bn and a near 50 per cent jump in adjusted net income.Tyson notched sales gains across its four main divisions in the three months to the end of September. Growth at its beef, pork, chicken and prepared food units were boosted by stronger consumer spending in the US and increased exports. Margins were further helped by higher meat supplies and lower prices for animal feed.“The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another record year,” said chief executive Tom Hayes.Although sales rose sharply during the quarter, net profit was largely flat at $391m due to costs related to its $3.2bn acquisition of packaged sandwich supplier AdvancePierre Foods earlier this year. Stripping this out, adjusted net income came in at $1.43 a share compared to the 96 cents recorded in the prior year period. Analysts had expected $1.36 a share on revenue of $9.9bn.The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the 2018 fiscal year. It is projecting sales to increase another 7 per cent to $41bn. The figure excludes revenue of the three non-protein businesses (Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) that it is selling.Shares in Tyson, up by more than a fifth so far this year, rose 3.1 per cent ahead of the bell. The gain puts the stock, which closed at $74.14 on Friday, one step closer to surpassing the record high of $77.05 reached last year.
28;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-09-28T20:46:44Z;Tyson Foods beefs up guidance, shares jump;;A renewed appetite for beef among American consumers has prompted meat producer Tyson Foods to lift its full-year earnings guidance, sending the company’s shares sharply higher in post-market trading on Thursday.Shares in Tyson, up 6 per cent so far this year, jumped another 6 per cent in after-hours trading as investors cheered the surprise rise in profits outlook.The company said it now expects adjusted earnings for the fiscal 2017 year, which ends this Saturday, to come in between $5.20-$5.30 per share, up from its previous prediction of $4.95-$5.05 per share.Arkansas-based Tyson attributed the revision primarily to “much better than expected earnings” in its beef business. The unit is the company’s biggest and generated 37 per cent of total group revenue and 24 per cent of group operating profit last year.As a result of the beef division’s outperformance, Tyson said it now sees adjusted earnings for the fiscal 2018 year between $5.70-$5.85, compared to the consensus guidance of $5.34 per share.Tyson, which is due to report its fiscal fourth quarter results on November 13, also outlined plans to cut 450 jobs across the group as it pushes ahead with previously announced plans to restructure its businesses.As a result of the restructuring, the company said it expects to take a one of charge of $140m-$150m in the fourth quarter.
29;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-08-25T14:26:09Z;Tyson Foods says SEC closes chicken-pricing investigation;;No fowl play.Tyson Foods shares nosed slightly higher on Friday morning after it said that US securities regulators had ended an investigation of the company related to allegations that it engaged in anti-competitive behaviour in the chicken market.The Arkansas-headquartered company — the largest producer of poultry in the US — said in a statement that it had received a letter from the US Securities and Exchange Commission on August 22 regarding the agency’s previously announced probe.“The letter stated that the SEC staff has concluded its investigation and that, based on the information it has as of that date, it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against Tyson,” Tyson said in a statement.Tyson shares have been weighed down in recent months by investigations sparked by civil litigation accusing the company and others in the poultry industry of colluding for years to drive prices higher. The company had previously said that it was cooperating with the SEC after receiving a subpoena on January 20 regarding the probe, which it believed was linked to the litigation.Allegations related to the Georgia Dock chicken products pricing index formerly published by the Georgia Department of Agriculture are also being investigated by Florida’s attorney general, Tyson has previously disclosed.Tyson shares were up 0.5 per cent in early trading on Friday.
30;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-08-11T18:52:04Z;Consumer staples set to be only sector to eke out weekly gain on S&P 500;;US stocks are poised for their biggest one-week sell-off since March, and consumer staples might be the only sector to eke out a gain when markets close on Friday.Heightened tensions with North Korea dominated headlines this week, weighing on investors’ risk appetite and prompting a broad-based decline in US stocks.A slate of disappointing earnings from department stores helped drag consumer discretionary stocks lower, while concerns about valuation alongside the risk-off sentiment weighed on the technology sector. However, energy led the decline, falling 2.7 per cent over the week as West Texas Intermediate, the US crude marker, dropped 1.7 per cent over the past five days.Consumer staples, however, rose 0.3 per cent over the week. The sector was led by Tyson Foods, which climbed 4 per cent over the week after the company forecast higher sales and said pork exports should boost its margins.
31;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-08-07T20:49:39Z;Tyson Foods climbs after summer barbecue weather;US stock volatility levels drop to five-decade low;Tyson Foods investors have the summer weather to thank for a jump in their shares as Americans fired up their barbecues.Increased appetite at home and abroad for its beef and pork products bolstered sales and prompted the Arizona-headquartered food company to nudge its full-year profit forecast higher.Tom Hayes, chief executive, hailed a “strong start for the grilling season” for the upgrade, among other reasons.For the three months ending July 1, Tyson reported net sales of $9.85bn, above the $9.46bn analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. Net income came in at $447m, versus the $437.9m Wall Street was looking for.Mr Hayes said sales for the quarter were 4.8 per cent higher, year-on-year, as “every segment delivered volume growth behind a strong start to grilling season and new product innovation.”The company attributed its increased revenue to increased domestic demand, strong exports and lower livestock costs.Chicken volumes also improved, albeit it at a slower rate than beef and pork. Some of the gains were partly offset by disruptions caused by fires at two of its plants.Tyson shares, which had sagged 14 per cent over the past 12 months, closed up 5.7 per cent at $66.90 on Monday in New York.The overall market was also positive: the S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,480.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 6,383.77 — continuing the steady moves higher that have characterised the latest leg of the bull run.In fact, the last time the US stock market was this becalmed, Richard Nixon was sitting in the White House and Sly & The Family Stone topped the US singles charts.The 10-day rolling volatility of the S&P 500 dipped to a five-decade low of just 2.43 per cent early on Monday — the lowest since February 14, 1969 — as the remarkable tranquility of markets this year is exacerbated by the traditional summer trading lull. It rose later, ending the day at 2.57 per cent.The CBOE Vix index of the short-term expected volatility implied by US option prices also dipped below 10 again.Elsewhere, Tesla is set to test investor demand for riskier corporate bonds as it readies to borrow $1.5bn through debt markets later this week.The sale, announced on Monday, would be the first from the electric carmaker in the high-yield corporate bond market and would be used to “strengthen” its balance sheet as it launches its newest vehicle, the Model 3.Its shares were down 0.5 per cent at $355.17 on the day.The company run by billionaire Elon Musk has traditionally issued convertible bonds or raised capital through equity markets, including nearly $4.5bn over the past three years according to Dealogic data.Tesla shares have advanced 66 per cent this year, giving the company a market valuation of roughly $60bn, above General Motors and Ford.Convertible bonds sold earlier this year from Tesla, that mature in 2022, have fallen 3 per cent from a June high, although they are up more than 25 per cent this year, according to fixed income trading platform MarketAxess.Twitter: @ericgplatt
32;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;‘Strong start to grilling season’: Beef and pork bolster Tyson Foods sales;;Increased appetites at home and abroad for its beef and pork products bolstered Tyson Foods’ sales and prompted the US-based food company to nudge higher its full-year profit forecast.For the three months ending July 1, Tyson reported net sales of $9.85bn, above the $9.46bn analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Tyson chief executive Tom Hayes noted that sales for the quarter were 4.8 per cent higher year-on-year, as “every segment delivered volume growth behind a strong start to grilling season and new product innovation”.It attributed its increased revenue to rising sales volumes in its beef and pork segments, thanks to increased domestic demand, strong exports and lower livestock costs. Chicken volumes also improved, albeit it at a slower rate, with some of those gains partly offset by disruptions caused by fires at two of its plants, among other factors, the company said.Net income attributable to the company came in at $447m, versus the $437.87m Wall Street was looking for, coming to $1.21 a share, compared to expectations for $1.18. Adjusted for special items, earnings per share were $1.28.The better-than-expected results prompted Tyson to lift its full-year profit outlook. It is now looking for adjusted earnings per share of $4.95-$5.05 for fiscal 2017, a 13 per cent increased year-on-year, adding to the lower end of its previous guidance for earnings between $4.90 and $5.05.It is also looking for full-year sales to top $38bn as sales volume expands across categories, with a target of $41bn in revenue for full-year 2018.Tyson shares, which have sagged 14 per cent over the past 12 months, were up 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading.
33;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-05-23T12:45:56Z;Greencore shares surge as Peacock lifts sales;UK’s biggest sandwich maker rises 8% after sales jump on back of US acquisition;Greencore, the UK’s biggest sandwich maker, has reported a 46 per cent jump in first-half sales, after a promising start to the group’s US expansion through last year’s $748m acquisition of Illinois-based Peacock Foods.Dublin-based Greencore said it expected annual sales to double between 2016 and 2018 to £3bn, thanks to Peacock and its own fast-expanding UK convenience food business, which registered a 16 per cent rise in sales in the six months to the end of March.Shares in the FTSE 250 group rose 8 per cent on Tuesday, recouping the 7 per cent one-day tumble they took last month on fears that Greencore could lose its most valuable customer Tyson Foods, after the US company bought AdvancePierre, a rival of Peacock.The shares are still 15 per cent down on a year ago after a volatile year punctuated by disappointing results when the group was making a push into the US by itself, before the Peacock acquisition.Regarding the relationship with Tyson, Patrick Coveney, Greencore chief executive, said: “We are comfortable and reassured about the prospects of us growing our business together, based on the set of initiatives we are working on together.”Greencore’s revenues of £1bn were 46 per cent higher than the same period last year, with £220m coming from Peacock since December, when the acquisition was completed.Peacock, which has annual revenues of $1bn, stands to quadruple Greencore’s US sales, which had been $300m before the acquisition.Group pre-tax profits dropped 44 per cent to £11.7m, mainly due to £22.9m of exceptional costs related to the acquisition, including fees and integration costs.Excluding these exceptionals, group operating profits rose 27 per cent year on year to £55.3m.Mr Coveney described 2017 as a “transition year” in which Greencore would integrate Peacock and work on delivering 20 per cent revenue growth in its UK food-to-go business of sandwiches and sushi. It is investing £100m in expanding production at some UK factories, after winning a number of new contracts.“You are seeing a high level of investment activity and change that’s been compressed into 2017,” said Mr Coveney.Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital, said: “We believe the Peacock acquisition will transform the group’s long-term prospects in North America from a previously subscale position.”
34;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-04-25T11:58:48Z;Tyson bulks up ready food unit with $4.2bn AdvancePierre deal;;It’s a deal made in processed food heaven.Tyson Foods, the US meat producer, is buying ready meal maker AdvancePierre Foods for $4.2bn, including debt.Tyson, which already owns Hillshire Brands, the maker of lunch meats and Ball Park hot dogs, is offering $40.25 cash per each AdvancePierre share – giving the company an equity value of about $3.2bn. In addition, Tyson will also assume about $1.1bn of AdvancePierre’s debt.The offer is 31.8 per cent premium to the target company’s unaffected share price. However, several traders noted to the FT that there was highly unusual trading activity in AdvancePierre shares in recent weeks.Oaktree Capital Management, which owns 42 per cent of AdvancePierre shares, has agreed to tender its holdings and support the deal.“The addition of AdvancePierre aligns with our strategic intent to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands,” said Tyson president and chief executive Tom Hayes.Tyson said it expects to cut approximately $200m in costs on an annual basis within three years of the deal closing.Ohio-based AdvancePierre makes ready to eat burgers and cold cut sandwiches for supermarkets, schools and convenience stores. The self-styled “leading national producer and distributor of value-added, convenient, ready-to-eat sandwiches, sandwich components” posted revenues of $1.6bn last year and employs about 4,500 people across the country.
35;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-03-16T18:16:01Z;Bird flu sickens shares in chicken producers;;Shares in chicken producers were down on their cluck after a second case of the bird flu was confirmed in Tennessee.The chicken farms, which are affiliated with Tyson Foods, are located less than two miles away apart and have begun euthanizing its chickens to prevent a the potential spread of the disease.Shares in the company fell 2.5 per cent on Wednesday, prompting a slide rival chicken producers. Sanderson Farms fell 2.1 per cent, Pilgrim’s Pride lost 1.2 per cent and Hormel Foods, which makes processed chicken food products, retreated 1.2 per cent.The virus, which rarely infects humans, was reported earlier this month by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, which has quarantined the area in Lincoln County. There are also reports of the virus in Alabama.Tyson said it was coordinating with the agriculture department and USDA on a quick response. All of its flocks are located within a six-mile radius of the original farm and will “not be transported unless they test negative for the virus”.“This a bird health issue and not a food safety or human health concern,” the company said in a statement. “We don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs.”The outbreak was compounded by analyst downgrades on the day. Although Tyson posted strong first quarter results, investors have expressed concerns regarding an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged manipulation of a chicken pricing index.John Staszak, an Argus analyst, said there was a potential for decelerating earnings in the upcoming quarters and was concerned about recent bird flu outbreak.
36;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-02-06T18:45:23Z;Tyson Foods: poultry results;There are questions around chicken profits and alleged price collusion;Meat might take a smaller share of Americans’ future diets. Tyson Foods, the largest US traditional meat processor, is anxious to hedge its bets. In December it launched its own $150m venture capital fund to find novel protein sources. It has already invested in a plant-based start-up called, appropriately, Beyond Meat.This followed another big strategic move in 2014: paying $8bn to win a bidding war for Hillshire Brands, which provided an entry into higher-margin packaged foods. Despite the steep price, investors appreciated the synergies. And over five years, the bold approach has paid off. Tyson shares have risen 234 per cent.For the time being, however, cows, pigs and chickens are still crucial. On Monday, they contributed to a record first quarter, with quarterly earnings up 38 per cent. Poultry, though, continues to let the side down.In the previous quarter, weak results in the chicken segment dragged down the earnings. The company attributed the margin shortfall to higher soyabean prices and one-time operational issues. The latest quarter brought more fowl results: another profit margin decline blamed this time on higher marketing expense. Still, Tyson’s beef and pork segments both hit record margins.If it were just chickens to blame, Tyson investors could be more sanguine but there are other clouds. In November, Tyson replaced its long-time chief executive. It also said it would spend $1bn in capital expenditures this year with the pay-off likely lower than operating costs.On Monday Tyson said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing what is thought to be the company’s role in an alleged chicken price collusion scheme (separate civil litigation is ongoing). Tyson was confident enough to boost its profit forecast for the fiscal year. But the litigation uncertainty sent the shares down another couple of points and they are now 18 per cent down from their October high.Tyson is thinking about the future of food. But investors remain preoccupied with the company’s past.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
37;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-02-06T16:37:54Z;Tyson falls amid SEC scrutiny over chicken-pricing suits;;Chicken-gate?Shares in Tyson Foods are in retreat on Monday after the US’s largest meat processor said it received an inquiry last month from US securities regulators, which it said is likely connected to a civil litigation accusing it and other companies of conspiring to fix broiler chicken prices.The Arkansas-company, the biggest player in the US for so-called broiler chicken – or birds raised specifically for meat production – said in a regulatory filing that it had been served a subpoena on January 20 from the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with an investigation related to the company. It said the allegations were likely similar to those in recent civil litigation that accused it of working with other meat processors to coordinate output, limit production and share sensitive information in order to boost chicken prices, claims that defendants have denied.“We are cooperating with the investigation, which is at an early stage,” the company said in the filing.Shares in the company fell 2 per cent to $64.10 in early trading in New York.Tyson and other poultry producers have faced a number of civil lawsuits over the past few months from distributors and other direct chicken purchasers, as well as related litigation from shareholders.Some of the allegations centre around producers’ use of the Georgia Dock, a widely used price index for wholesale chickens, which some people bringing the lawsuits claim was manipulated and artificially inflated by producers, a claim the companies have also denied. The Georgia Department of Agriculture, which oversees the benchmark index, said in December that it was suspending the weekly benchmark while it formulates a new price index.The legal scrutiny has cast a cloud over what was an otherwise upbeat set of quarterly earnings from Tyson earlier on Monday, which showed a 38 per cent year-on-year increase in earnings per share, to $1.59, while sales remained relatively flat at $9.18bn, compared to $9.15bn from the same quarter a year earlier. It also raised guidance for the upcoming year, predicting a 12 per cent increase in adjusted earnings per share from 2016, to come in at $4.90-$5.05, up from its previous forecast of $4.70-$4.85.
38;TSN;Tyson Foods;2017-02-03T13:14:48Z;Brenda Barnes, consumer products executive, 1953-2017;Leader who found an equilibrium between boardroom and children;When Brenda Barnes resigned in 1997 as head of Pepsi-Cola for North America, little did she know it would reignite a fierce debate around work-life balance.Having shattered the glass ceiling to become one of the world’s most powerful businesswomen, by opting to focus on her three children she seemed to puncture something else instead — the idea that women could “have it all”.For Barnes, who has died aged 63, the decision had been purely personal. Nor were her following seven years restricted to the kitchen and the touchline of a school soccer pitch. She sat on boards including those of The New York Times and Sears, taught at Northwestern University and served as interim president of Starwood Hotels.Yet her resignation lingered. “My moment of fame in life was quitting my job . . . It’s not exactly what I aspired to,” she quipped at a speaking engagement at Stanford University in 2009.Then, in 2004, Barnes hit the financial and feminist headlines again — by snagging a top post at Sara Lee, where she was soon elevated to chief executive.Her return to the highest echelons of corporate America, once her offspring were older, suggested that perhaps women could indeed have it all — just not all at once. Reflecting on her experience, she established “returnships” for women at the company.Brenda Jo Czajka was born on November 11 1953 in Chicago, the third of seven daughters of a pipe fitter, who along with her mother shaped her strong work ethic. Her first job was sorting mail on the night shift at a post office — grunt work that she credited with giving her pointers in bringing dignity and an “element of fun” to a role.Graduating with a degree in economics from Illinois’ Augustana College, whose board she later chaired, Barnes joined Wilson Sporting Goods in 1976, then part of PepsiCo’s empire, while earning an MBA from Loyola University Chicago.In 1980 she moved to the parent soft drinks company and began to climb the ranks. In the same year she married colleague Randy Barnes, divorcing amicably after 26 years.At Sara Lee, Barnes set about selling off 40 per cent of the bakery-to-bras consumer group and battled to meet a self-imposed target of raising profit margins to 12 per cent from 8 per cent. Jon Harris, a friend who worked for her both there and at PepsiCo before joining ConAgra, says she advised him it was good “to be tough, as you owe it to shareholders, but it’s never an excuse to be mean. That was Brenda to a T.”Shedding many international and other operations enabled the company, renamed Hillshire Brands, to be acquired in the end by Tyson Foods.All the while, she was unafraid to let loose. In his eulogy for Barnes, Jim Nolan, another PepsiCo colleague who is now at Bimbo Bakeries USA, describes a work celebration with spouses. Leading the conga dance, “Brenda made a sharp turn and all of us in our cocktail attire, just like lemmings . . . followed her right into the pool . . . and then right out the other side.” He adds: “I lost a watch that night. But it didn’t matter — we would have followed her anywhere.”While her colleagues held her in high regard, she found tough love among some analysts — one of whom questioned her ability to lead a multinational after being a mum for several years. “I stayed calm didn’t throw anything at him, though I felt like it,” she told Stanford students, adding that mothers run much of society, from which they draw crucial experience. “I learnt I have to have a thick skin [or] else it gets in the way, and there’s too much to get done.”In 2010 she suffered a stroke, forcing her to step down from Sara Lee. Barnes, who succumbed last month to another stroke, is survived by her children and Sal Barrutia, her partner of eight years.During her career, the advance of technology came to offer women a wider range of ways to combine work and family. Bigger numbers of male executives are also seeking a form of work-life balance that suits them.Still, “if anything, the Brenda Barnes story speaks to how few role models we have”, says Samantha Ettus, an author and speaker on women and the workplace. “If there were thousands of Fortune 1,000 current and former female CEOs, then one woman’s story wouldn’t be used as an example for an entire gender. Because we have ridiculously few women CEOs, each woman’s story takes on too much weight.”Barnes herself never sought to be a role model. It was all about being good at her job, trying to make a success of parenthood too, and juggling those priorities accordingly — whether hour by hour or year by year.Lindsay Whipp
39;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-11-21T17:43:38Z;Tyson shares plunge on profit guidance and chief’s departure;Meat producer’s sales fall 13% amid decline in demand;Shares in Tyson Foods, one of the world’s largest meat producers, on Monday suffered their worst fall in eight years after the company said profits for next year would come in below analyst forecasts and it announced the departure of its chief executive.The stock, which had been up more than 26 per cent for the year in the run-up to the fourth-quarter earnings report, plunged 17.3 per cent to a nine-and-a-half-month low of $55.72, slicing nearly $3.5bn off Tyson’s market value.Tyson said Donnie Smith would be stepping down at the end of the year as chief executive, a role he has held since 2009. He will be replaced by president Tom Hayes, who oversaw supply chains at Hillshire Brands, the maker of lunch meats and Ball Park hot dogs that was acquired by Tyson in 2014.The news came as Tyson unveiled a disappointing end to what had been an outstanding fiscal year.For the three months to October 1, sales fell 13 per cent from the same period the year before to $9.15bn — against $9.4bn expected by analysts — amid declining demand for chicken, beef and pork. In the company’s all-important beef division the weaker trend was compounded by a near 15 per cent fall in average prices during the quarter.However, profits jumped more than 51 per cent to $391m, as lower feed prices and lower interest and tax expenses helped pad the bottom line. Earnings per diluted share came in at $1.03, short of the $1.16 the market had forecast, despite $600m in share buybacks during the period.Mr Smith acknowledged in a conference call that the results were “slightly below our internal expectations”, but were poised to rebound in 2017 as chicken and pork demand improves and livestock costs fall faster than retail prices.“We’re growing where we want to grow by selling more branded, higher-margin products,” Mr Smith said.Nonetheless, investors appeared rattled by Tyson’s earnings guidance for next year. After several quarters of heady growth, sending shares to a record high of $77.05 in September, the company said it expects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to come in between $4.70 and $4.85, a 4 to 7 per cent increase from 2016 but below the $4.98 the market was projecting.
40;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-11-21T16:13:29Z;Tyson shares crater after CEO exits, outlook disappoints;;Tyson Food shares are having their worst day in over eight years on Monday as investors brace for a period of slower growth after the meat processor issued a stinging profit outlook for next year and announced the surprise departure of its chief executive.The stock, which had been up more than 26 per cent for the year ahead of today’s earnings, plunged by as much as 17.3 per cent to a nine-and-half month low of $55.72 on the news.The decline marks the shares’ biggest one day drop since November 2008 and sliced nearly $3.5bn off the company’s market value.Tyson said in a statement that Donnie Smith will be stepping down as chief executive at the end of the year following seven years on the job. He will be replaced by president Tom Hayes, who oversaw supply chains at Hillshire Brands, the maker of lunch meats and Ball Park hot dogs maker that was acquired by Tyson in 2014.News of the transition comes as Tyson, one of the world’s largest meat producers, unveiled a disappointing end to what had been an outstanding fiscal 2016 year.For the three months to October 1, sales fell 13 per cent to $9.15bn compared to the prior year period amid a sharp drop off in demand for chicken, beef and pork. The decline was far steeper than the drop to $9.4bn analysts were expecting and was led by the company’s all important beef division where the the weaker volume trend was compounded by a near 15 per cent drop in average prices during the period.Fiscal fourth quarter profits jumped more than 51 per cent to $391m however, as lower feed prices and lower interest and tax expenses helped pad the bottom line. Earnings per share, came in at $1.03 per diluted share. While the figure was flattered by the $600m in share buybacks the company enacted during the quarter, it still came in short of the $1.16 a share the market had forecast.Mr Smith acknowledged in a conference call with investors that the results were “slightly below our internal expectations,” but said it expects things to pick up in 2017 as chicken and pork demand improve and livestock costs fall faster than retail prices.“We’re growing where we want to grow by selling more branded, higher margin products,” Mr Smith said.Nonetheless, investors appeared spooked by Tyson’s earnings guidance for next year. After several quarters of heady growth, which helped send shares to a record high of $77.05 earlier in September, the company said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal 2017 year to come in at between $4.70-$4.85, a 4-7 per cent increase from 2016 but below the $4.98 the market was projecting.
41;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-08-08T14:30:23Z;Wall St struggles to add to record run;;Wall Street struggled to add to its record run on Monday as investors took a breather after pushing two of the three main benchmark indices to fresh highs last Friday.The S&P 500 hit a new all time high of 2,182.87 and the Nasdaq Composite struck a new closing high on Friday after non-farm payrolls data showed the US economy added a better-than-expected 255,000 jobs in July.The gains, which represented the second straight month of strong jobs growth, were the latest evidence that the US economy is enjoying a “Goldilocks” moment right now – that is, growth is humming along, but not fast enough for the central bank to rush to raise interest rates.But confidence over the health of the world’s most important economy was not enough to help US stocks extend their rally on Monday.The main indices all struggled for direction and were fluctuating between minor gains and minor losses in early morning trading.At pixel time, both the S&P 500 and the Dow were down 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent.With the earnings season more than three-quarters of the way through, investors also appeared to be cheered by the better than expected results so far. About 78 per cent of firms that have reported have beaten profit predictions and 56 per cent have topped sales projections, according to Bloomberg data.Tyson Foods was the latest to beat analysts estimates and raised full year expectations on Monday. Other companies due to report this week include News Corp., Walt Disney and Macy’s.Yields on the 10 year Treasury bond edged 0.2 basis points lower to 1.58 per cent. The dollar extended its gains from last week, with the DXY index rising 0.2 per cent to 96.38.
42;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-08-08T13:31:43Z;Tyson beefs up forecast, shares jump;;Tyson Foods is beefing up its earnings outlook once again.The US’s biggest meat processor saw its shares jump more than 3 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday after it raised its earnings forecast for the year and delivered a bumper set of third quarter results.Sales for the three months to July 2 were down 4.1 per cent at $9.4bn amid lower beef prices and weaker chicken and pork consumption. However, this was more than offset by lower feed and livestock costs, which helped boost profit margins and drove net income at the company up 41 per cent to $484m for the period.The market had forecast sales of $9.33bn. Operating profit margins rose to 8.2 per cent for the quarter, compared to 5.6 per cent during the prior year period.Expectations that input costs will remain depressed prompted the Arkansas-based group to raise its earnings guidance for the third time this year.It now expects adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal 2016 year to come in $4.47-$4.57 , compared to its previous estimate of $4.20-$4.30.Tyson shares, up 76 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a fresh intraday record high of $74.85 last week. The stock is expected surpass that level when the market opens on Monday.

Analysts at Jefferies said this was an “excellent deal” for Freeport, however.A fall in oil and copper prices has affected Freeport’s ability to pay down its debt burden. Net debt stood at more than $20bn at the end of March, compared with the company’s market capitalisation of $15.4bn.Freeport shares have advanced more than 55 per cent so far this year following a 71 per cent drop in 2015.The drop in Freeport came on day when US stocks fluctuated between gains and losses. At the close, the S&P 500 was little changed at 2,058.7, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,705.9 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 4,750.2.The S&P 500 healthcare sector posted the biggest gain on the benchmark index, rising 1.1 per cent. The rally was led by a 6 per cent advance in Allergan shares to $213.71.Sotheby’s shares fell by as much as 8.5 per cent in early trade after the New York auction house swung to a loss in the first three months of the year. However, news that an outside investor was considering building up a 10 per cent stake in the group gave its shares a boost, as they closed the day 6 per cent higher at $28.91.The company slid to a loss of $25.9m, or 41 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $5.2m, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 32 per cent to $106.5m. Analysts on Wall Street were looking for a loss of 27 cents a share on sales of $120m.Sotheby’s noted the global art market has two selling seasons, which occur in the second and fourth quarter of the year and that the company typically reports lower sales and net losses in the first and third quarter.After posting a 35 per cent drop in net auction sales in the first quarter, Thomas Smith, chief executive, also noted that “this week’s sale of impressionist, modern and contemporary art are smaller than a year ago, down 38 per cent at the midpoint of our expected ranges”.Shares in Tyson Foods climbed 1.5 per cent to $68.24 after the meat producer reported stronger-than-expected profits and lifted its earnings outlook for the year.The Arkansas-based company reported fiscal second-quarter profits of $432m, or $1.10 a share, on sales of $9.2bn, topping analysts’ estimates.The group also lifted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $4.20 to $4.30 a share, up from $3.85 to $3.95 a share, ahead of forecasts.Krispy Kreme shares jumped 24.3 per cent to $20.96 after JAB Beech said it would acquire the US doughnut chain for $21 a share in cash, in a deal with an equity value of about $1.35bn.
44;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-05-09T16:26:50Z;Tyson shares hit new high after profit guidance boost;;Tyson Foods is flying high.Shares in the US meat processor climbed to a new record high on Monday after the company raised its full year earnings guidance and delivered better than expected fiscal second quarter results.Sales for the March quarter were down 8.1 per cent at $9.17bn amid lower beef, chicken and pork prices. However, this was more than offset by falling corn and soybean meal feed costs, which helped boost profit margins and drove net income at the company up 39 per cent to $432m for the period.Tyson said it reaped the benefit of $95m in lower input cost during the quarter while gross profit margins rose to 12.9 per cent from 9.9 per cent the prior year period.Expectations that grain costs will remain depressed has prompted the Arkansas-based group to raise its earnings guidance for the year.It now sees adjusted earnings for fiscal 2016 at $4.20-4.30 per share, compared to its previous forecast of $3.85 to $3.95 a share.The stock gained by as much as 4.7 per cent in response, taking its year to date gains to more than 28 per cent.
45;TSN;Tyson Foods;2016-03-02T15:23:54Z;Healthy bars and nibbles reshape US snacks market;Busier lifestyles and demographic shifts help change consumer tastes;Daniel Lubetzky became tired of waiting for a company to produce the sort of healthy snacks he craved. So he started making his own.“In the early 2000s, I was travelling a lot and kept finding that there weren’t healthy snacks available that tasted good and satisfied my hunger,” social entrepreneur Mr Lubetzky says. “These frustrations with my own snacking options sparked the idea for Kind.”He was not the only one with cravings for healthy snacks. Kind Snacks, which makes nut and fruit bars, sells its products in 150,000 stores, with sales rising 36 per cent last year. It is one of many start-ups either taking on America’s food giants in the growing healthier snack sector — or being bought by them.Sales of snacks — including bakery snacks, biscuits, confectionery, ice cream, snack bars, yoghurt and savoury snacks — jumped 17.4 per cent to $145bn in the five years to 2015, according to Euromonitor. This growth is being driven by products which are perceived as more healthy, analysts and executives say. And they are confident that trend will continue.“It’s certainly going to continue to be one of our growth platforms,” says James Snee, chief operating officer at Hormel Foods in a recent interview. “At our core we’re protein based so the idea of being able to . . . take from traditional formats [and transform] into snacking formats serves us well.”US sales of energy and nutrition bars have surged 87.5 per cent to $2.48bn in the five years to 2015, while nuts have increased 34.7 per cent to $4.55bn, fruit bars have risen 16.5 per cent to $1.17bn and yoghurt has risen 26.8 per cent to $8.38bn, according to Euromonitor.The shift towards foods perceived to be healthier is changing America’s food industry, and this is particularly the case in snacks. For a number of years, consumers have been more aware of the types of food they eat amid a nationwide obesity and diabetes type 2 crisis.Busier lifestyles and a more diverse population is also driving the rise in snacking, highlighting the growing importance of convenience. Driven by millennials, consumers are eating on the go more often than in the past, sometimes using snacks to replace meals, executives say. The average consumer eats five times a day, Tyson Foods points out. A shift to city dwelling means smaller kitchens for some and less cooking.Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market. It’s bringing in a lot of companies“The traditional image of mom and dad sitting down for dinner at 6pm with two children . . . is as outdated as the typewriter,” Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup, recently told investors. “We live in a polycultural society with diverse tastes and norms. The one size fits all approach is long gone.”But what exactly is a healthier snack? There is no single definition and what consumers find important health wise can change over time and between generations. For some, the focus on weight loss or low carbohydrates has shifted to eating less processed fare even if it is not so low in fat.Protein has become a focus, leading to a renaissance in high-end jerky sales, but the product still contains relatively high salt levels. And some nutrition bars may contain largely unprocessed ingredients but still have sugar levels comparable to candy bars.A key trend at the moment is having only simple and recognisable ingredients in food — known as clean labelling. This means free from artificial colours, preservatives and additives. Organic continues to grow in popularity as does GMO-free food.“The things that people are most worried about vary,” says Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein. “Over the past two or three years, there has been a massive conversation online about fillers and preservatives. There’s definitely been opting for ‘I don’t want artificial’.”Leaders in the snacks market, such as PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay and Mondelez, have for some time been introducing products and technology aimed at removing the guilt from indulging. Pepsi in December introduced a smart vending machine selling its “better for you” snacks with a digital function that gives nutritional information. Meanwhile, Mondelez is targeting half of its sales to come from its “wellbeing” snacks, up from a third now.Demand for healthier snacks has lured companies who previously had little or no exposure to the category as well as newer companies such as Kind and Graze of the UK, which sells trays of nuts and dried fruit via online subscription.Abbott Laboratories — a nutrition and medical devices company — this month introduced its first new range of snack bars in more than a decade.Tyson, a relative newcomer to snacks via its Hillshire brands acquisition, is capitalising on “gourmet” jerky sales, as is chocolate maker Hershey, which has bought jerky brand Krave.“Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market,” says Jared Koerton, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s bringing in a lot of companies into a new market [for them], or ones trying to expand into new product areas.”

It also yanked about $10bn from its market value.LinkedIn generates the bulk of its sales through services that utilise its userbase to provide products that help companies find job candidates and generate business-to-business sales.That is one reason why analysts homed in on LinkedIn’s announcement that it will close its Lead Accelerator business, which it launched only last year.LinkedIn said demand for the product that lets companies target ads to specific audiences was “solid,” but it “required more resources than anticipated to scale”.LinkedIn plans to incorporate the technology into its Sponsored Content unit but may take a $50m hit to revenue this year as part of the plan, it said.Analysts said the move represented a gamble that could pay off by helping LinkedIn focus more closely on businesses that it can grow, but some wondered if LinkedIn was too quick to dismiss a group with substantial potential.“We think it is making a gigantic mistake stepping back on investment in its ad network,” said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest, in a note to clients.Three Wall Street banks downgraded the stock to hold on Friday.Shares in US oil company Hess fell 12.54 per cent to $38.02 after it priced a stock sale to strengthen its balance sheet amid a slump in crude prices that began nearly 20 months ago.The sale is made up of 25m shares at $39 a piece and 10m depository shares at $50 a share, which could see the company raise about $1.4bn after deducting certain fees.Hess, which last week reported its first annual loss in 13 years, said it will also use the money for its “longer term capital needs”.Hanesbrands was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, falling more than 15 per cent to $24.96, after the retailer issued a 2016 sales outlook that missed analysts’ expectations.The North Carolina-based company said it expects sales of $5.8bn to $5.9bn in fiscal 2016, below analysts’ forecasts for $6.3bn.That came alongside fourth-quarter profits of $119.2m or 30 cents a share, and sales that declined 7.4 per cent to $1.4bn, also shy of estimates.Shares in Tyson Foods jumped as much as 13.5 per cent to a record high of $58.95 after the US meat processor raised its full-year profit forecast as feed costs declined. They closed 9.9 per cent up.The Arkansas-based company now expects fiscal 2016 earnings in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share, up from $3.50 to $3.65 a share. That topped analysts’ expectations for $3.63 a share.Consumer and technology stocks weighed heavily on the S&P 500. By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.85 per cent to 1,879.91, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.29 per cent to 16,203.49 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.25 per cent to 4,363.43.

Revenues fell 3.6 per cent to $2bn, shy of forecasts.New video game software sales, which accounted for almost a third of its revenue last year, fell 20.4 per cent.Meanwhile, new hardware, which accounted for almost 22 per cent of its 2014 revenue, fell 9.3 per cent.Retailers such as GameStop have been under pressure as consumers download games digitally at an increasing rate instead of buying physical versions.This weighs on the retailer in two key ways, said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.“GameStop does not have nearly as high market share in digital games than physical ones,” he said. “This results in fewer trade-ins of used games, which generate much higher profit margins for GameStop than new ones.”For the current quarter, the company expects comparable sales in the range of -1 per cent to 6 per cent growth, compared with analysts’ estimates for 4.3 per cent growth.GameStop expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.32 a share, below expectations.Shares in GameStop fell 15 per cent to $33.53 in early trading, taking the stock’s year-to-date decline to 0.2 per cent.

Can do, through “My Cow,” creation of a privately owned Australian company. Targeting the Chinese market, customers can buy a whole cow — available to visit, but ultimately for delivery in parts.In the past year, more ambitious buyers have bought cattle ranches, too. Chinese bidders are reportedly interested in purchasing Australia’s biggest private landholding, which is on the block.The trend towards higher meat consumption worldwide is clear. As societies get richer, diets add protein.In China, since 2003, meat eaten per capita has risen by a quarter, to 57kg, according a report from consultants PwC. It would have to grow another 30 per cent to catch up with Taiwan.With livestock requiring more resources per calorie than other foods, demand for grains and feedstocks is also likely to rise.China’s quest for food has already resulted in many mergers and acquisitions — nearly $20bn of cross-border deals in the past five years alone, according to Dealogic.Targets have ranged from grain trader Noble Agri, in which Chinese entities bought a majority stake last year, to US based pork rearing and processing company Smithfield.Gaining exposure to this growth story is not straightforward. Despite the generally, um, bullish backdrop, recent pronouncements from US listed meat companies have been downbeat.Beef producer Tyson Foods’ latest quarterly results missed forecasts due in part to an oversupply of beef, weak Chinese demand and the strong dollar. Poor export performance was a drag at chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride, too.Shares in US meat producers are at least cheap, at mid-teens multiples of 2016 earnings. And the Chinese demand boost will last longer than the current supply cycle and perhaps even the strong dollar.In the meantime JBS, Brazil-listed meat producer and parent of Pilgrim’s Pride, reports in reals, and 90 per cent of output is exported. Next: My Cow in Brazil.This note has been amended to reflect that Chinese entities bought a majority stake in Noble Agri, not Singapore-listed Noble Group as first stated.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

That was shy of Wall Street forecasts for earnings of $3.44 a share.Beef, Tyson’s biggest division, which accounted for 42 per cent of group sales last year, fell into an operating loss of $7m for the quarter, compared with an operating profit of $101m last year, due to higher cattle costs.The company said it sold beef at lower values in other markets rather than build up inventory because of the West Coast port strikes. Tyson said its beef business was also impacted after feedlots fell behind on their marketing schedules, leaving the company with a low supply.Tyson warned that the unit should be “near break-even for fiscal 2015 and profitable, but below its normalised range” of 2.5 to 4.5 per cent for fiscal 2016, as a result of the “imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand”.The news came alongside disappointing third-quarter results. Tyson said weaker export prospects as a result of the stronger dollar shaved $84m off its third-quarter results.The company reported profits of $343m, or 83 cents a share, compared with $260m, or 73 cents a share. Sales rose 4 per cent to $10.1bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of 93 cents a share, on sales of $10.3bn.Shares in Tyson Foods, which are up 8 per cent over the past year, fell 9.9 per cent to $39.96.Michael Kors shares fell 7.9 per cent to $38.66 as analysts at Piper Jaffray lowered their price target from $44 to $38.“Our checks suggest inventory for Michael Kors is building at retailers like Macy’s & Dillard’s,” Erinn Murphy, an analyst at Piper Jaffray said. “Watches remain under pressure in the US and are starting to slow in Europe.”Shares of Loews, a provider of commercial property insurance and a hotels and energy conglomerate, fell 2.8 per cent to $37.03 after the company reported second-quarter profits that were shy of analysts forecasts.The New York-based company reported profits of $170m, or 46 cents a share, compared with $116m, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year prior. This missed analysts estimates for earnings of 66 cents a share. Sales fell more than 4 per cent to $3.4bn.Loews said its operating profits for the quarter fell after the drop in crude prices weighed on Diamond Offshore, the company’s second largest subsidiary, accounting for 20 per cent of overall revenue in 2014.US stocks began the week on the back foot after a 5 per cent drop in the price of Brent crude pushed the S&P 500 energy index 2 per cent lower.The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,098.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 17,598.20.

50;TSN;Tyson Foods;2015-07-15T13:11:31Z;Review: Myths and Mortals by Andrew Keyt;Advice on how to keep businesses within the family and pitfalls to avoid;"There are many pitfalls in family businesses: nepotism, feuds between relatives, as well as the mythologies that swirl around the leaders. Take, for example, Rupert Murdoch, a towering figure in charge of a vast media empire whose children, standing in the shadows, are often portrayed as pale substitutes.The author describes how such myths can be damaging. Larger than life, the leaders of a family business bring with them stories of heroism and history. Their successes seem impossible to replicate.There is good reason for wanting such companies to do well. Family businesses are important to the economy. According to the not-for-profit Institute for Family Business, two-thirds of UK businesses are family-owned; they generate more than a quarter of UK gross domestic product and employ about 9.9m people.Yet they are often characterised as old-fashioned and constrained by the ties that bind a family. The belief is that family-owned companies can only do well if they behave like public companies, says the author. However, he insists that the opposite is true.Such businesses have a myriad of areas where they outperform public companies, particularly when it comes to survival rates. This is because, the author asserts, “families who work together toward a legacy tend to stay together — and their businesses thrive”. However, he fails to untangle the dynamics of a publicly listed company dominated by a family.The author has talked to successors of family business legends, including Christie Hefner, former chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, and John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, as well as drawing on his own experiences having served as manager in two family-owned companies and running the Loyola University Chicago Next Generation Leadership Institute.There are some mistakes, Keyt notes, that can keep a successor in the shadows — idealisation of the leader as well as infantilisation of the family member who will succeed. Idealisation can lead to parent-pleasing and the older one gets, according to Keyt, the harder it becomes to step out of their shadow.“The patterns become so ingrained, the belief systems hardened,” he writes. “If a parent is building an empire, a child reasons, the stories explain their parent’s absence and why they always felt like a runner-up in the pick of priorities.”Whereas infantilisation keeps children immature, cosseted from harsh realities and put in a position they are not up to. It means the parent will swoop back in to save the day, reinforcing their dependency. Keyt advises parents and children that separation and defining one’s own success is vital.The most common of the parents’ fears, the author says, is that the children will feel entitled and squander the family fortune. There is plenty of advice for successors and leaders as well as exercises to discover whether you are ready to hand over or take over.After all, the consequences are not just professional, they are also personal. Bella Hoare of C Hoare & Co, is quoted giving this advice: “Don’t join until you’re damn sure you want to stay there . . . leaving your family business makes you almost unemployable.”The reviewer is a writer for Business Life"

In its latest quarter, the company said it ably handled the record US harvest of corn and soyabeans and large volumes of grain sales from Canada.David MacLennan, Cargill chief executive, said: “Just as last quarter’s focus was on getting ready for North America’s big harvest, the current quarter was all about execution. Our team did an excellent job serving farmer customers and fully utilising our supply chains to meet domestic and export demand.”At the same time, Cargill’s results were somewhat offset by the effects of South American farmers who are hoarding grain and delaying sales as a hedge against inflation.With operations spanning dozens of countries, Cargill is an important middleman between surplus producers and importers. It is also one of the largest privately owned companies in the world, with revenue of $135bn in its latest full fiscal year.Our team did an excellent job serving farmer customers and fully utilising our supply chains to meet domestic and export demandAgricultural trading houses tend to have better returns when they are running assets such as silos and processing plants at high rates of capacity, which has been a challenge after the weather-related supply disruptions of the past few years.That has begun to change as bumper crops across the northern hemisphere allow stocks to build. Cargill’s origination and processing division was the biggest contributor to quarterly results, the company said. BMO Capital Markets said its earnings rose 50 per cent year on year. Cargill did not provide specific data on segment performance.Cargill is also a large meat supplier, processing poultry, pork and beef. Strong sales of turkeys over the US Thanksgiving holiday were among the factors that helped to boost its animal nutrition and protein division, which BMO said enjoyed a 48 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.In November, Cargill said its branding of birds raised without growth-promoting antibiotics in the US helped aid demand.In an interview with the Financial Times last year, Mr MacLennan said Cargill’s performance was not meeting his expectations after several years of disappointing results. About 100 descendants of company founder William Wallace Cargill own about 90 per cent of its common stock.
52;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-11-19T18:30:14Z;Continental Grain warns on margins in US chicken business;Chairman says group is considering a float as the commodities cycle might be about to turn;Plump profit margins in the US chicken business may be about to fly the coop, a top food and agriculture investor warned as he hinted at listing shares in a poultry producer he controls.Chicken farmers have dined out on fat profits in the past year thanks to abundant global feed grain supplies and strong demand for poultry as a cheaper alternative to beef.But Paul Fribourg, chairman and chief executive of Continental Grain company, told a New York forum on Wednesday that the commodities cycle might be about to turn.Privately held Continental, a well-known name in global commodities that was founded 201 years ago, owns Wayne Farms, the sixth-largest poultry producer in the US with more than $1.9bn in annual sales, according to its website.Mr Fribourg said the chicken industry reached its nadir several years ago, when US chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride and others filed for bankruptcy.“We were at the low of the commodities cycle in chicken, because grain prices were very high and chicken prices were low. So there was an opportunity to go out and buy very cheap chicken companies,” Mr Fribourg said.“Today the cycle has gone to the other extreme, where you have incredibly high chicken prices and very low grain prices,” he added. “It’s not going to last. So at the top of the cycle we’re now looking at ways to lock in either long-term margins, or possibly, for example, take our chicken company public.”Continental is a leading investor in food and commodities, having taken stakes in companies including Burger King and Smithfield Foods, the pork producer bought last year by China’s Shuanghui International, now called WH Group.Mr Fribourg is the sixth generation descendant of Simon Fribourg, who founded the family business in Belgium in 1813. He rarely discusses business in public.The US poultry business has bounced back spectacularly from lean years. Shares of listed US poultry producer Sanderson Farms have risen 86 per cent in the past two years, while Tyson Foods – the largest chicken company and also a beef and pork supplier – has seen its share price double.Profit margins in the chicken business are “pretty sensational,” said Bill Lapp of Advanced Economic Solutions, a food and agriculture consultant. “It’s an industry that’s doing well and could remain in good shape into early 2015.”However, Mr Lapp said the fragmented poultry industry had historically seen farmers expand flocks too fast, sabotaging their own success. “Their mantra tends to be ‘No profit shall go unpunished’,” he said.
53;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-11-18T18:27:50Z;Tyson Foods: there’s the beef;Low commodity prices boosted quarterly forecasts, but also add to risk;"Beef is judged by its cut. But a steak is judged by how it is cooked. Shares in US meat producer Tyson Foods dropped in July when it agreed to spend $8.6bn on rival Hillshire Brands. The deal seemed too expensive. But Tyson has pushed on regardless, and its operations look strong. This week it reported record quarterly results, beating forecasts thanks to low commodity prices. But that is where the risk lies too.Shares in all large meat producers have jumped over the past two years. Tyson is up 70 per cent; Sanderson Farms is up nearly 80 per cent; and Pilgrim’s Pride is up threefold. That is because cereal stocks – used for chicken, cattle and hog feed – have been steadily rising due to bumper crops in Europe and China. The bigger the stocks, the cheaper the feed. The price of wheat middlings, a common ingredient in cattle feed, is a third lower than it was a year ago, for example. That goes through to the bottom line. Profits at Sanderson Farms doubled in the first nine months of this year due to lower costs.Is this sustainable? According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, feed stocks will rise to 25 per cent of annual consumption next year, the highest level in more than a decade. But prices can still vary. Soyabean meal prices have been rallying since the start of October, when they hit a 33-month low. Scarcity is not the problem. Lack of rail cars in the Midwest is. Shale oil and gas is crowding out grain trains, among other issues.Tight supplies of beef, which this year enabled Tyson to push its prices up 22 per cent, are set to stay. This is good for the entire industry. Demand is expected to rise as the US economy improves and consumers appetite for red meat swells.Tyson is undervalued compared with peers – the Hillshire deal still weighs on the price. But on 11 times earnings versus 18 for Sanderson, it offers some juicy cuts for investors seeking proteins.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 87 cents a share topped forecasts for 77 cents a share.The company expects more growth and increased profitability in the chicken and prepared foods segment.Donnie Smith, chief executive of Tyson Foods, said the company’s acquisition of prepared foods maker Hillshire Brands earlier this year will be seen as “a watershed event”.For fiscal 2015, the company projected earnings in the range of $3.30-3.40 a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast guidance of $3.33 a share. The company expects that elevated beef and pork prices will help boost chicken demand by 3 per cent over the next few years.Shares in Tyson Foods gained 6 per cent to $43.03 and are up 29 per cent so far this year.Apple climbed as much as 2.7 per cent before paring its gains in early morning trading on Monday, touching $117.28, or $820.96 when adjusting for the company’s June 7-for-1 share split.The gain puts it above a price target analysts across Wall Street had set in autumn 2012 as shares pushed past $700 in anticipation of the iPad Mini launch.On average, analysts had laid out a 12-month price target of $780 in September 2012, data from Bloomberg shows.Lacklustre results, however, and rising concern that competition would cut into its growth soured sentiment and sunk Apple shares over the following eight months.The company’s shares have since recovered, buoyed by aggressive share buybacks, strong sales of a new flagship smartphone and the release of Apple Pay.Allergan shares gained 5 per cent to $209.20 after the Botox maker agreed to a $66bn deal with Actavis.Actavis said it will pay $219 for each Allergan share, valuing the Botox maker at $66bn.On hearing the news, Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has had its takeover offers rebuffed, said that it “cannot justify to its own shareholders paying a price of $219 or more per share for Allergan”.Actavis shares gained nearly 2 per cent to $247.94.Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oil services company, agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $38bn.

55;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;RBC pushes aggressively into US dealmaking market;Canadian lender now earns more than half its investment banking revenue in US;When Tyson Foods launched its $8.5bn bid for Hillshire, the hot-dog maker, Royal Bank of Canada found itself facing a difficult decision.At the point Tyson entered the fray, the battle to control America’s processed food industry was sizzling. Hillshire, already the target of a bid from Pilgrim’s Pride, was itself pursuing the acquisition of pickle and frozen meals producer Pinnacle Foods.RBC, which had relationships with all four companies, had to choose who to team up with.It was not always so. In years past, the Toronto-headquartered bank was a peripheral operator in the US M&A market, outgunned by the traditional Wall Street institutions – and more aggressive foreign rivals – when competing for deal mandates.But the expansion of RBC’s investment banking operations in the US, fuelled by an aggressive hiring spree, has been pronounced during the past five years.So far this year, RBC has collected fees of $856.6m in the US, according to data from Thomson Reuters, more than triple the $262.4m it made in the whole of 2008 – an increase that has helped it move from having 1 per cent of the overall fee pool at the start of the financial crisis to 3 per cent today.In doing so, it has pivoted its entire business model: as of this year, the investment bank now generates more than half of its revenue in the US.“Having more than half of our business here in the US shows prospective employees that we are here for the long haul – that’s important to someone committing their future,” says Blair Fleming, head of RBC’s investment bank and capital markets in the US.To fuel the next phase of this growth, RBC has recently embarked on a hiring spree that is turning heads at some of the US’ largest banks. During the first half of 2014 it hired 19 managing directors into its investment bank and lost only 5, giving it a net gain of 14. Of the traditional Wall Street banks, only one had a net positive MD hiring rate – JPMorgan – while all the others declined, according to data from recruitment company Sheffield Haworth.“Part of the proposition is that when the financial crisis occurred, we were presented with the opportunity to build out our US business and we were able to grow more quickly and more profitably than we could have otherwise,” says Mr Fleming.RBC shares the advantage of many of its Canadian peers of having gone into the crisis with relatively little exposure to the worst hit parts of the financial system. But it was also quick to act when trouble hit, selling off its money-losing retail banking operation to PNC Financial in 2011.Mr Fleming, who took the reins of the US investment bank in 2009, says, only half jokingly, that when RBC was pitching for deal work before the financial crisis, they were often confused with Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK lender that expanded aggressively – both in the US and at home – only to be laid low by the onset of the crisis. Today, RBS is in the process of exiting a large part of its US operations, spinning off Citizens Bank through an initial public offering last month.“The ambition is to keep growing the market share but in a way that is stable,” says Mr Fleming. “We have learnt the lesson of other banks that have come in and tried to build too quickly – it doesn’t last.”He is also keen to steer away from the practice of buying out entire teams from rival banks. “We avoid it. If you bring in a whole team, it can create a them and us mentality and disenfranchise the staff.”When the financial crisis occurred, we were presented with the opportunity to build out our US business and . . . grow more quickly . . . than we could have otherwiseIn spite of the positive momentum, there is scepticism among rivals about RBC’s ability to marry rapid expansion with best practice.Earlier this year, the bank was rebuked by a Delaware judge who ruled that RBC had, in its desire to profit, failed to disclose conflicts of interest when advising ambulance operator Rural/Metro Corp on its sale to private equity buyer Warburg Pincus. RBC, which was also offering to fund Warburg’s acquisition, a practice known as staple financing, was accused of pushing for a quick sale rather than seeking a higher price.Also, although RBC has made inroads to the broader dealmaking market in the US, it still generates a disproportionate amount of its business from the energy and natural resources sector, reflecting its Canadian roots. Mr Fleming and his lieutenants are keen to grow the bank’s role in other sectors, but concede it will take time.Processed food deals may not be core to that endeavour, but having the pick of which party to back in any transaction is a luxury banks fight hard to preserve. In the end RBC chose to side with Tyson, the successful buyer of Hillshire.
56;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-07-28T15:11:34Z;Tyson to sell Brazil and Mexico poultry operations;;Tyson Foods has agreed to sell its poultry businesses in Brazil and Mexico to rival JBS, the world’s largest meat processor, for $575m in cash.The move comes just over a month after Tyson beat JBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s Pride in a bidding war for Hillshire Brands, the packaged meat company. The Arkansas-based company said it would use the proceeds, along with the sale of shares, to pay down debt associated with its $8.6bn acquisition of Hillshire.“Although these are good businesses with great team members, we haven’t had the necessary scale to gain leading share positions in these markets,” said Donnie Smith, chief executive of Tyson Foods.JBS said the Mexican and Brazilian assets it is buying will boost revenues by about $1bn annually.It is paying $400m for the Mexican business and $175m for Tyson’s three processing units in the south of Brazil, it said.The deal comes amid a flurry of activity in the food sector, as conglomerates reshuffle their brands, producers seek to win back pricing power from a consolidated retail industry and global groups seek growth in new markets.It also marks a milestone in the long-running rivalry between Tyson and JBS, the Brazilian company that has spent billions on acquisitions over the past decade in order to overtake Tyson as the world’s largest meatpacker.Tyson, the largest US meat processor, said it will continue to serve Mexico with US-produced chickens and some poultry produced in the country through a co-packaging arrangement with Pilgrim’s Pride.While it is shrinking operations in Latin America, Tyson said it “intends to remain focused on growing its poultry operations in Asia”.Tyson also plans to focus more on the areas where Hillshire is a market leader: packaged and prepared foods, along with the breakfast category, which are important growth segments in the meat industry.The news came as Tyson reported net income of $260m, or 75 cents a share excluding one-time items, in the quarter ended June, up from $249m, or 68 cents a share excluding items, during the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 11 per cent to $9.68bn.Analysts had expected Tyson to report earnings of 78 cents a share and sales of $9.47bn.Tyson reported a $15m operating loss for its international business in the quarter, driven by weakness in Mexico, Brazil and China.Shares in Tyson rose 3 per cent to $40.56 by close of New York trading, while shares in JBS were up nearly 2 per cent.In May this year JBS, which is controlled by Brazil’s Batista family, announced plans to float its poultry and processed food unit in a bid to raise further cash for its global expansion plans.Additional reporting by Samantha Pearson in São Paulo

In both realms, people are becoming pretty excited about familiar brands.I’ll start with the pork because that’s usually what we do when it comes to matters of governance in this country. Plus, it has been a big week in American meat. In a blockbuster deal, Tyson Foods, an Arkansas company that processes about a fifth of US beef, chicken and pork, agreed to buy Hillshire Brands, owner of the Jimmy Dean sausage brand, for nearly $8.6bn.Even if you are vegetarian, the Tyson transaction is noteworthy, since it is typical of our times. Big companies are in good shape, but the economy is not, so they are using their cash for acquisitions that offer opportunities for efficiencies or provide a modicum of diversification.It’s a cautious strategy as such things go, and led Tyson to one of our best-known food brands. Jimmy Dean breakfast sausages were made famous by their creator, a country star, who served as the folksier-than-thou television pitchman for his eponymous processed meat products for decades. He died four years ago aged 81.Still, betting on such an established name proved risky for Tyson because it did so with such zeal. Several Wall Street analysts say the company overpaid and investors have sent its shares lower in the days after the deal.It is a cautionary tale, which is particularly provocative because of the parallels in the US political scene as we gear up for the 2016 presidential election.Amid the same uncertainties, much of today’s campaign-related sizzle is being generated by two old-line brands as ubiquitous in our politics as Jimmy Dean sausages have been in our breakfast skillets. I speak of Bush and Clinton – names found on seven straight winning tickets in presidential elections before the emergence of Barack Obama in 2008 enabled Americans to change the channel, as it were.Jeb Bush, 61, seasoned by two terms as Florida governor, is a favourite of moderate Republicans seeking a less piquant alternative to such fiery competitors as Kentucky’s Rand Paul, Ted Cruz of Texas or the Jersey Shore’s Chris Christie.Hillary Clinton, 66, is staking out a similarly flavoured position on the Democratic side. She published a book this week about her time as secretary of state, which Slate’s John Dickerson described as a “low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert”.The Bush and Clinton brands are sure things in the Jimmy Dean mould. They have been processed and market tested, making them particularly palatable for a number-crunching donor class that also trades in pork products, tech start-ups, fixed-income securities, commodities and all that jazz.The danger, of course, is that political brands like any others can lose their appeal. Former Tea party projectile Eric Cantor found as much this week when he was defeated in a Republican election in his Virginia district by an even more rightwing opponent and said he would like to leave his post as majority leader in the House of Representatives.The question facing the Bush and Clinton brands is whether their well-cultivated ambiguity will help or hurt. For all their renown, we know relatively little about what – if anything – Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton have in mind for the US. Mr Bush is obviously trying to set himself apart from red-meat Republicans on immigration by saying that many of the people who come here illegally are engaging in “acts of love”. But if memory serves, all the Bush men perform this sort of kinder-gentler, compassionate-conservative number before they invade Iraq or nominate hardliners for the Supreme Court.The former secretary of state, meanwhile, offers the promise of a Clinton restoration, but that’s a slippery subject in its own way. Are we returning to the first Clinton term, when the president and his wife tried – and failed – to secure healthcare reform? Or the second, when Bill Clinton signed legislation that cleared the way for the creation of more complex banks and exempted credit default swaps from stricter regulation?It’s too bad we can’t ask the late Jimmy Dean for help on these matters because it would probably take a good sausage man to fully explain the Bush and Clinton political brands. As for now, they smell pretty good in the frying pan, but it’s hard to know exactly what’s inside these things.gary.silverman@ft.com
59;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-06-10T16:48:13Z;Tyson Foods slides after raising Hillshire bid;Premium offered by Tyson not seen benefiting short-term investors;Tyson Foods, the US meat producer caught in a bidding war earlier this year for Hillshire Brands, slid for a second day after the company lifted its offer to $8.55bn, a concern for analysts and investors who are sceptical of how it will generate returns on the deal if ultimately consummated.Tyson’s $63-a-share cash offer forced Pilgrim’s Pride to withdraw from the bidding, although Hillshire has yet to back the bid.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the 70 per cent premium offered by Tyson would create value for investors who have a “seven, ten, or twenty-year investment horizon”, although it will not benefit shorter-term investors.“Unfortunately, most investors don’t have the luxury of investing with such a long-term view,” analyst Robert Moskow said. “We believe Tyson stock will be dead money at best for the next 12 months as it copes with the hangover of paying such a big price.”Shares of Tyson fell 4 per cent to $36.07 by close of trading, taking its losses over the past three months to 7 per cent. Shares of Hillshire were unchanged at $61.97 while Pilgrim’s Pride were 2 per cent higher at $25.02.After rallying 15 per cent over the past month, shares in B/E Aerospace were felled by news the company had shelved plans to sell the company or one of its units in favour of separating into two businesses.The company said it would split into one company focused on manufacturing aircraft cabin interiors and another focused on distribution, logistics and technical services for the aerospace and energy services markets. Shares declined 5 per cent to $94.15.Shares of Chico’s, the womenswear chain, soared 8 per cent to $16.53 after the Financial Times reported the retailer is exploring a sale to private equity groups and has discussed a deal with potential suitors that could lead to one of the largest take-private transactions so far this year.The publicly traded retailer, which held a market value of $2.36bn before the report, has spoken to several private equity buyers in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the situation.eHealth, the private healthcare website exchange, was under pressure after brokerage Jefferies lowered its view on the company to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’, citing issues connecting to the federal government’s data hub.The hub allows a select group of private website exchanges to sell insurance policies listed on healthcare.gov to individuals, but those connection issues have hindered the business.“During our healthcare conference, CEO Lauer indicated discussions with the government to fix federal data hub connectivity hadn’t improved and that officials weren’t making it a high priority,” analyst David Styblo said.eHealth shares fell 13 per cent to $33.91.Facebook was among the top performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 on Tuesday after it poached David Marcus, the president of eBay’s payments division, PayPal, to lead its messaging products division.Once a pioneer, Facebook is trying to keep pace with the fast-changing way in which people communicate online. It has launched several standalone apps over the past year, including a rival to photo-sharing app Snapchat. Facebook climbed 5 per cent to $65.77.Shares in eBay fell 3 per cent to $48.25 following the announcement, and the departure of Mr Marcus caps a testing six months for the company.RadioShack shares continued a years-long tumble, falling 10 per cent to $1.38, after reporting another poor quarter in which like-for-like sales dropped 14 per cent.Overall sales for the quarter to May 3 dropped to $737m from $848m in the same quarter a year ago. The chain’s loss for the period ballooned to $98m from $28m.Like other electronic retailers who made their names and fortunes before the arrival of the internet, RadioShack has been beset by online competition.The Texas-based company is closing stores, revamping others and working with an incubator of technology start-ups in an effort to win back American consumers.Twitter was helped by another brokerage upgrade, as Wells Fargo added its name to a growing list of investment banks who believe the stock’s sharp decline since the year’s start represents a buying opportunity.“While we remain concerned about user growth and engagement, we believe Street expectations have declined substantially following two quarters of relatively modest user growth,” analyst Peter Stabler said.Mr Stabler lifted his rating to ‘market perform’ from ‘underperform’, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $35.37.Overall, equities coasted lower after four straight days of gains. The S&P 500 fell 0.02 per cent to 1,950.79 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.02 per cent to 16,945.92.

60;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-06-09T18:30:45Z;Tyson wins bid battle for Hillshire Brands;;Tyson Foods has knocked out rival poultry producer Pilgrim’s Pride in the bidding war for Hillshire Brands with what it called a “unilaterally binding” $8.55bn offer, bringing it a step closer to acquiring the maker of Ball Park hot dogs.Tyson’s $63-a-share offer topped the latest $7.7bn bid from Pilgrim’s, which on Monday said it would not increase its offer.Hillshire agreed to talks with both suitors last week. But the Chicago-based company said Monday its board had not approved the Tyson offer or changed its recommendation in favour of Hillshire’s planned acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, the frozen foods maker, which must be cancelled in order for the Tyson deal to proceed.“Hillshire Brands does not have the right to terminate the merger agreement with Pinnacle Foods on the basis of the Tyson Foods offer or enter into an agreement with Tyson Foods prior to its termination,” Hillshire said.But analysts said the company would likely face a shareholder revolt if it turned down the Tyson bid, which represents a nearly 70 per cent premium to Hillshire’s unaffected share price. Hillshire shares were up nearly 5 per cent, to $61.85, in New York trading, while Tyson shares were down nearly 5 per cent, to $38.23.The acquisition would give Tyson, the largest US chicken processor, a firmer foothold in the prepared and packaged foods market, an important growth segment in the meat industry, and give it a prime position in the breakfast category. Donnie Smith, Tyson chief executive, said the deal “would represent a defining moment for Tyson Foods”.Mr Smith told analysts on a conference call that while the transaction may seem rushed, Tyson had “been thinking a long time about Hillshire and how it can complement Tyson”.It comes amid a flurry of activity in the food sector, as companies seek to win back pricing power from a consolidated grocery business and global groups seek new international markets.May 2014: Global merger and acquisitions activity has just passed the $1tn mark – the first time the figure has been reached at this point of the year since 2007.It is also a victory for Tyson in its long-running rivalry with Pilgrim’s and its majority owner JBS, the Brazilian company that has spent the past decade making acquisitions in order to overtake Tyson as the world’s largest meatpacker.The offer caps a bidding war that began a month ago when Hillshire announced that it would buy Pinnacle for $6.6bn, a move that many saw as a means to head off a takeover.Two weeks later, Pilgrim’s offered $6.4bn for Hillshire so long as it cancelled the Pinnacle deal. Within 48 hours Tyson offered $6.8bn. Last week, Pilgrim’s raised its bid to $7.7bn.If the Hillshire board cancels the Pinnacle deal, it must pay that company a $163m termination fee. Tyson’s offer expires on December 12.Tyson said the transaction would be paid in cash and through a fully-committed bridge loan from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, which are advising the company along with Davis Polk & Wardwell. The company said it expected to rapidly pay down debt through the deal’s projected $300m in annual cost savings.
61;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-06-09T17:01:11Z;Tyson/Hillshire: Meatpacking district;Tyson wants to take a bite out of the market for prepared products;According to a recent Tyson Foods investor presentation, “a strong capital structure creates opportunities”. Its latest opportunity: winning the brief but intense bidding war for pork processor Hillshire Brands. Tyson’s $63 per share offer ($8.6bn in total) knocked out smaller rival Pilgrim’s Pride – which withdrew from the auction saying it is a “disciplined acquirer”.Tyson’s heft proved to be the winning edge. It commands an enterprise value of $15bn (versus Pilgrim’s $7bn). But its shares traded down 5 per cent on Monday, suggesting that shareholders are wondering if Tyson boss Donnie Smith chose the right opportunity.Tyson is a purveyor of protein. Its revenues are divided between beef (41 per cent), pork (15 per cent) and chicken (31 per cent). The diversity has paid off as commodity shocks in recent years have shifted the value proposition between meats. Poultry is now fashionable as strong grain harvests have lowered feed costs. Chicken has also benefited from rocketing beef prices– cattle supplies remain thin – as well as high pork prices brought on by diseased pigs. Tyson has taken out $1bn in costs from its vertically integrated chicken business since 2008. Its beef and pork businesses are not integrated in the same way and have managed to pass on higher input costs.Having mastered the commodity meat business, Hillshire presents the chance to get into more “prepared” meats. Hillshire’s operating margin of 9 per cent is double that of Tyson’s. The EV to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation deal multiple is 11 times. However, that multiple includes $300m in cost savings, a thick slab, representing 40 per cent of Hillshire’s operating costs in the past 12 months. Tyson’s shares are up 200 per cent in the past five years. The best opportunity may be for Tyson shareholders to collect their gains.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
62;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-06-03T17:05:06Z;Casinos sink on Macau spin of wheel;;US casino operators fell broadly as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, fell short of Wall Street expectations.Overall gaming revenues rose 9.3 per cent from a year earlier to 32.4bn Macanese patacas, or $4.1bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Analysts on average had expected a rise between 13 and 15 per cent.Since the year’s start, revenues have reached roughly $20.8bn, or 16 per cent higher than the year ago level.Analysts with Citigroup said much of the weakness in the sector – the Dow Jones US Gambling Index has fallen 13 per cent over the past three months – has been due to recent reports of “crackdowns on illegal use of Union Pay Cards, transit visas and junkets running away”, which they say are overblown.“Adding to pressure, in May the Macau government announced that a full smoking ban in the mass gaming areas will be implemented,” analyst Anil Daswani said.“Again, we believe these fears are overdone as the ban will not apply to premium mass or VIP.”Citi added the addition of new rooms would likely lift overall growth in the sector in the coming years.Wynn Resorts fell 4.49 per cent to close at $208.23, Las Vegas Sands dipped 2.57 per cent to $75.44 and MGM Resorts International declined almost 3 per cent to end the day at $25.83.Dollar General stuck to its profit forecast even as consumers spend more on lower-margin items at a US discount chain that has fared well since the financial crisis.The company, which is based in Tennessee, said it was generating lower profits from its sales as shoppers buy more “lower-margin consumables” such as tobacco and candy.While Dollar General stuck to a prediction that it will make between $3.45 and $3.55 a share in the current financial year, it cautioned “the volatility of the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure the consumer”.Overall, sales climbed almost 7 per cent to $4.52bn in the quarter to May 2. Net income rose to $222m from $220m.Shares in the company advanced 3.85 per cent to close at $56.39.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages, said it will start talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods over the takeover bids that the companies have each made.Shares in Hillshire jumped about 9.5 per cent to close at $58.65 after Pilgrim’s Pride confirmed it had raised its offer from $45 a share to $55 a share in cash.Pilgrim’s Pride shares fell 2.24 per cent to $25.34 while Tyson declined just over 3 per cent to $42.07.Tyson Foods has an offer of $50 a share, or roughly $6.8bn, on the table.The fight for Hillshire, which itself is trying to buy rival food producer Pinnacle, comes as companies seek to wrestle pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.US carmakers advanced on Tuesday as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all topped monthly sales expectations.Any reputational damage that General Motors has incurred because of its mass recall of cars has yet to reach showrooms in the US.Sales of its vehicles rose 12.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, almost double the tally that analysts had forecast.Although the figures echo the strong performance across the industry last month, they also underline that the decision by GM chief executive Mary Barra to recall more than 10m cars in the US has not put off consumers.Ford reported a 3 per cent rise in US sales in May. Ford shares rose 0.64 per cent to $16.55 while General Motors climbed 1.12 per cent to close at $35.25.Overall, US equity markets closed slightly lower. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.04 per cent to 1,924.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent to 16,722.34.

63;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hillshire agrees to hold talks with rival suitors;;The bidding war over Hillshire Brands is heating up, with the packaged meat company agreeing to hold talks with its suitors after Pilgrim’s Pride raised its offer to $7.7bn, up $900m from rival poultry processor Tyson Foods’s bid.Pilgrim’s new offer, which includes debt, is equivalent to $55 a share and tops its original $6.4bn offer by $1.3bn. It represents a 49 per cent premium on Hillshire’s unaffected share price. Pilgrim’s made its first offer last Tuesday, followed two days later by Tyson, which offered $6.8bn for Chicago-based Hillshire.A person familiar with the offer said it was “a decisive, major step”, not an incremental offer. “The ball is not in Pilgrim’s court.”The new offer sent Hillshire shares soaring 9.5 per cent to $58.65 by the close of New York trading, and came as the company said it would “provide information” and conduct talks with both bidders.The $55 a share cash offer marks the latest salvo in the long-running rivalry between Tyson, the largest US meatpacker, and JBS, the majority owner of Pilgrim’s. JBS has spent the past decade making a series of acquisitions to overtake Tyson as the world’s largest meat company.The combined Hillshire and Pilgrim’s would generate more than $12bn in annual revenues, and join Colorado-based Pilgrim’s fresh and frozen chicken business with Hillshire’s focus on beef and pork, including Ball Park hot dogs.The bidding war comes amid a flurry of activity in the food industry, as global groups seek growth in new markets, conglomerates reshuffle their brands and producers seek to win back pricing power from retailers. Hillshire’s willingness to conduct talks with its suitors raises questions about whether its plans to acquire Pinnacle Foods, known for Vlasic pickles and Birds Eye frozen foods, will go through.Hillshire announced its $6.6bn acquisition of Pinnacle three weeks ago, though many questioned whether the merger, which lacked clear cost efficiencies, was meant to head off a potential takeover.Both Tyson and Pilgrim’s have said that they would only acquire Hillshire if it cancelled the Pinnacle transaction, incurring a $163m termination fee.The acquisition would help both Pilgrim’s and Tyson, which are traditionally known for fresh or frozen poultry, ramp up their offerings in packaged foods and breakfast, key segments.But analysts have warned that packaged meat companies do not generally offer much global growth opportunities.Pilgrim’s said its offer was not subject to any financing or contingencies and would result in more than $300m in annual cost savings.
64;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-05-29T16:55:42Z;Tyson offers $6.8bn for Hillshire Brands;;Tyson Foods has injected itself into the deal frenzy gripping the US food industry with a $6.8bn bid for Hillshire Brands, an offer that came less than 48 hours after Pilgrim’s Pride launched a $6.4bn takeover.Both Tyson and Pilgrim’s are seeking to block Hillshire, the company behind Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, from going ahead with its planned $6.6bn acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, announced two weeks ago.If Hillshire swallows Pinnacle, a frozen foods maker, the enlarged business would be a less attractive and expensive target, according to analysts.Tyson’s $50 a share cash offer is also the latest jab in its long-running rivalry with Brazil-based JBS, which owns a majority stake in Pilgrim’s. JBS has spent the past decade making acquisitions in order to overtake Tyson as the world’s largest meatpacker.Donnie Smith, Tyson chief executive, said his offer, which was $5 a share higher than his rival’s, was “more certain than what can be attained in the near term by the company either on a standalone basis or in combination with any other food processing company”.Hillshire shares closed 17.7 per cent higher at $52.76, indicating investors expected still higher bids. Chicago-based Hillshire said in a statement it was reviewing the Tyson bid “in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisers”.A person familiar with Pilgrim’s offer said the company was considering its options. “Anything’s on the table,” the person said.Hillshire will incur a $163m termination fee if it drops Pinnacle, which did not respond to requests for comment.If Tyson succeeded in buying Hillshire it would create a company with more than $39bn in annual revenues. It would also give Tyson access to Hillshire’s strong breakfast business, an increasingly important meal for food companies.“We believe that the strength of Hillshire’s products in the breakfast category would allow Tyson to capture opportunities from shifting consumer trends in this attractive and fast-growing daypart where Tyson has little presence today,” Mr Smith said.Bob Goldin, of food consultancy Technomic, said the acquisition of Hillshire would help Pilgrim’s and Tyson, which are traditionally known for fresh or frozen poultry, break further into packaged foods, another key segment.“What it does for Tyson and/or Pilgrim’s is offer more of a stable profit stream,” he said.But he warned that packaged meat companies do not generally have the “global expansion capabilities” to justify their high prices. Pork loins tend to sell better than hot dogs in China, he said.May 2014: Global merger and acquisitions activity has just passed the $1tn mark - the first time the figure has been reached at this point of the year since 2007.Tyson shares had jumped nearly 8 per cent to $43.94 before closing at $43.25. Pilgrim’s shares closed 1.1 per cent lower at $25.09. Pinnacle shares were up 1 per cent to $31.68.Tyson said it had secured a fully committed bridge facility from Morgan Stanley, which it expected to be joined by JPMorgan. Both banks are advisers. The company said it was prepared to issue equity as financing.Shortly after news of the offer, JBS USA, parent company of Pilgrim’s, announced it had temporarily withdrawn an unrelated bond offering on which Morgan Stanley had been lead arranger.
65;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Yum Brands shakes off bird flu fears;;Yum Brands struck a bullish tone for 2014 even after the fast food group reported a 5 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings which showed food safety concerns continued to weigh on its China division.David Novak, chief executive, called 2013 a “challenging year” for the company behind the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell brands. However, he reaffirmed a previous forecast of double-digit earnings growth, sending shares up 4.22 per cent, to $68.95, in after-hours trading in New York.The Kentucky-based company reported net income of $321m, or 86 cents a share excluding one-time items, for the three months to December 28. That compared with $337m, or 83 cents a share excluding one-off items, during the same period a year earlier. Revenues fell 1 per cent, from $4.18bn to $4.15bn.Analysts had expected earnings of 80 cents a share on $4.26bn in sales.The news comes days after Shanghai began a three-month ban on live poultry sales and as Hong Kong launched a three-week ban on Chinese poultry and killed 20,000 birds after mainland Chinese imports tested positive for bird flu.Jonathan Blum, chief public affairs officer, said the company was “not seeing any impact nationally on our sales in China” from the fresh reports of avian flu.Food safety concerns and an avian flu outbreak early last year sent Yum’s China same-store sales plummeting. But the company went on a marketing offensive and was thought to be recovering when it reported positive sales growth in November and December.Same-store sales in China fell 4 per cent during the quarter, and fell 13 per cent for the full year.August 2013: The chief executive of Fonterra apologised to Chinese consumers for a food safety scare that threatened to damage the reputation of the world’s largest dairy exporter in one of its most important marketsThe company is China’s largest western restaurant group by sales and number of outlets, with more than 4,400 KFC restaurants alone. China contributes around half of Yum’s total revenues.Yum is not the only company being hit by bird flu concerns in China.On Friday Donnie Smith, chief executive of Tyson Foods, the largest US meat processor by sales, said the company would slow the pace of its China expansion as mainland demand for chicken continues to suffer.Mr Smith told analysts on a conference call that the company no longer expected to break even in China in the fiscal year ending in September. Because demand for chicken had not rebounded from the food safety and avian flu scares that began in late 2012, there was a “substantial oversupply of chicken”, he said.“Now, there are new concerns about avian influenza,” Mr Smith said. “Because of these factors, we decided to slow down on building more chicken farms beyond those currently planned for this fiscal year until market conditions improve.”Tyson ultimately plans to build 90 large chicken houses in China in order to supply its processing plants with quality-controlled poultry raised in sanitary conditions.
66;TSN;Tyson Foods;2014-01-07T17:15:58Z;Beef: varied diet;A good thing meatpackers such as Tyson Foods and JBS also have exposure to chicken;Where’s the beef? Stampeding higher, as it happens. US cattle prices have risen to fresh highs at the start of 2014, building on a multiyear climb as the US herd has shrunk. The question for meatpackers such as Tyson Foods and Brazil’s JBS is whether they can pass on the higher prices in an environment where US consumers remain constrained.An annual USDA survey from January 2013 showed 89m head of cattle and calves, the lowest inventory since 1952. Ranchers have culled in response to lower demand – consumers are favouring chicken as a cheaper and healthier alternative – and elevated feed costs in recent years. The price of corn soared in 2012 when a severe drought hit the Midwest of the US.The 2013 corn crop was particularly good, and prices have fallen sharply, but it takes three to five years for cattle prices to adjust, according to JPMorgan. (Gestation alone is nine months for cows.) The timeline for chicken, by contrast, is a matter of months. This, and the greater demand, mean the outlook for chicken is much better than for beef. Any increases to the herd also mean an initial decline in supply as ranchers hold some lucky cows back from the slaughterhouse for breeding.Good thing, then, for shareholders of Tyson and JBS that each has exposure to chicken, too, which should help offset some of the pressure on beef. At Tyson beef contributed 42 per cent of sales in 2013, but with margins at about half those of chicken, operating income from beef was 22 per cent of the total against 47 per cent for chicken. JBS, which controls Pilgrim’s Pride, can also steer towards its Brazil beef business where exports should benefit from the real’s declines. Sometimes investors want pure plays, but the dynamics in animal protein show diversification can have meaty benefits.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
67;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Meat producers: talking turkey;US poultry producers are clucking, and for good reason;Too soon? Some Americans may be too full to think about chicken, pork and beef – and don’t even mention turkey. But US poultry producers are clucking, and for good reason. Last year, they endured a severe drought in the Midwestern part of the country. The price of corn – a key component of feed – spiked above $8 a bushel in 2012. It has since fallen back to half that, and the US will harvest a record crop this autumn.Lower grain costs factored into the positive outlook at Hormel Foods, which this week said it expected earnings per share in 2014 to rise as much as 16 per cent. Hormel processes turkey and pork and manufactures packaged foods such as Spam and Dinty Moore stew. Now is a good time to be in the turkey business. As input costs have fallen, so have production levels (242m birds in 2013 versus 254m, according to the USDA). That bodes well for pricing. But it is not all good news down on the farm. The outlook for hogs is less clear – a virus has created uncertainty. Still, in 2013, Hormel also bought Skippy brand peanut butter, which it expects will lift earnings per share by a mid-single digit percentage this fiscal year.Investors are already reaping gains. Shares of Hormel have risen 50 per cent over the past year as prospects improved. At $45, the stock trades at 20 times next year’s earnings. Fellow meat producers Tyson Foods (chicken, beef and pork) and Pilgrim’s Pride (chicken), which have also rallied sharply, trade at 12 and 9 times, respectively. These two are more pure commodity plays than Hormel, which is a diversified seller of branded products. That justifies some premium. Hormel’s earnings multiple was also higher than the median – 17 times – over the past 10 years. Here, too, expansion is warranted given growth expectations and the addition of Skippy.But at these prices, Hormel is starting to look a bit stuffed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
68;TSN;Tyson Foods;2013-08-05T21:52:32Z;Tyson Foods: still tasty;Meat processor could benefit from concerns about quality;Returns on Tyson Foods haven’t exactly been chicken feed. The stock is up more than 50 per cent so far this year and nearly 100 per cent during the past 12 months. Tyson, along with other meat processors, was under pressure during last year’s drought in the US, which raised the price of the grain these companies feed chickens, cattle and hogs. Now grain prices are falling in anticipation of a bumper crop. Last week, for example, only 2 per cent of the Midwest region was in drought, compared with 74 per cent a year ago, according to the US Drought Monitor.On Monday, Tyson’s shares rallied to all-time highs following quarterly earnings that beat expectations. For the quarter to June 29, Tyson’s net profit more than tripled. The year-ago quarter included a charge for the early repayment of debt, but underlying profitability also rose. The chicken segment, which contributes about half of operating profits, had record operating income in the quarter with margins increasing to 7 per cent from 5.6 per cent a year ago as higher sales and prices offset rising input costs. Demand for chicken, as a cheaper and healthier alternative to beef and pork, is up and Tyson has moved away from fixed contracts in recent years to be able to adjust its prices based on its grain costs.With the favourable weather this year, the company should have the advantage of lower input costs. And, Tyson is expanding internationally, including in China where it stands to benefit from concerns about quality. Shuanghui International this year agreed to buy pork producer Smithfield Foods. Investors should be aware that the Tyson family, through a special class of stock, controls about 70 per cent of voting rights. At $30, Tyson trades at 11 times forward earnings versus an average of 10 since 2010 and a high of 14. That isn’t exactly chicken feed either, but might still be tasty.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Shares in Tyson rose 4.1 per cent to $29.69 and have risen more than 53 per cent this year.Tyson’s ability to raise prices to offset increasing business costs has helped the company to beat analysts’ estimates.Berkshire Hathaway also issued a positive report that sent shares higher, beating earnings per share estimates. Warren Buffett’s conglomerate delivered net earnings of $4.54bn in the second quarter on a strong showing by its rail and financial derivatives businesses.Berkshire’s A shares rose 0.5 per cent to $177,300.But positive earnings were not enough to continue the record-setting run from US equity markets. The S&P 500 ticked down 0.2 per cent to 1,707.14, with eight of the 10 major sectors closing in negative territory.The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalisation companies shook off weakness from the broader market, touching fresh record highs. The index was up 0.2 per cent to 1,061.46.The S&P 500 rally in 2013 has been so consistent that analysts are beginning to assert that the question is not if the market will suffer a decline, but when. The benchmark index has been positive in six out of seven months this year.While long-term prospects for US equities remain bright, there is some concern in the short term that investors will begin to lock in profits, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, in a note.“From strength comes suspicion that things look too good to be true, and that a new, and possibly deeper, stock market decline looms,” he said. “Since no one really knows when the rally will end, it may be wise to lock in the gains of some high flyers and reinvest in those that have yet to leave the ground. You may just have a shorter distance to fall.”S&P Capital IQ has a 12-month target for the S&P 500 of 1,780.JC Penney shares fell 3.2 per cent to $13.82 despite announcing the hiring of Debra Berman, a Kraft Foods executive, as its new head of marketing. The position had been vacant for the past 14 months.Shares in the retailer have struggled in 2012 as the company attempts to recover from a decline in sales following an attempt by its former chief executive – Apple veteran Ron Johnson – to reinvent the company.The company is hoping a return to its former discount ways will put it back on track, but analysts have been worried about the rate at which the company is spending its cash reserves.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.3 per cent to 15,612.13, but the Nasdaq finished slightly higher at 3,692.95.The tech-heavy index was helped by a 3 per cent gain from Facebook.

South America is expected to produce record corn and soyabean harvests just as stocks in the US run low.Brazil will overtake the drought-plagued US as the world’s largest corn exporter this year, with export prices at the port of Paranagua consistently cheaper than corn along the US Gulf of Mexico, USDA said.“The current crop is also expected to be a bumper harvest,” the agency’s foreign agricultural service said in a circular last week. =Cheaper grain and oilseeds will bring relief to the food industry, especially livestock and poultry companies. Tyson Foods, a top US chicken and beef producer, anticipates feed costs will rise by $600m this year.“At these price levels, this is an attractive buying opportunity for some end users” of feed, said Erin FitzPatrick, commodity analyst at Rabobank.The sharp retreat of grain prices has caught many speculative traders by surprise. Money managers have been building net bullish positions in corn since early January, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, suggesting some are now being flushed out of the futures market.Analysts warn that prices of grain futures for imminent delivery could nevertheless jump as Brazil’s transportation network strains to move a huge crop to the world.Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, two of the largest international merchants in the region, have reassured investors they had expanded storage silos and invested in port facilities to handle massive exports, but some in the market worry about a short-term squeeze until South American supplies reach international markets.Oil World, a German oilseed market consultant, described a “long line of ships waiting for soyabeans at Brazilian ports” and “unusually small farmer selling” in Argentina, partly because they are waiting for a peso devaluation that would increase the local profitability of export sales.“Any delays in transporting the commodities to the ports can, in turn, delay the expected global replenishment,” Chris Narayanan, agricultural analyst at Société Générale, said in a report. He added that while this could temporarily keep prices high, bullish surprises from South America were becoming unlikely.
71;TSN;Tyson Foods;2012-07-05T20:24:05Z;Meat producers face record feed prices;;Meat producers are braced for a sharp hit to profits after the price of a key ingredient for fattening chickens and pigs hit an all-time high as a result of the intense heatwave in the US farming belt.Soyabean meal, crushed from oilseed and mixed with corn to make animal feed, on Thursday exceeded the record set during the 2007-08 food crisis. Benchmark CBOT July soyameal futures rose to a record $475 per short ton, up 4.6 per cent.Other futures markets also surged late in the session. Corn was at its highest in more than a year, with benchmark CBOT July corn reaching $7.76¾ a bushel, up 8.1 per cent on the day. The December contract, against which much of the coming harvest will be priced, hit a peak of $7.13 a bushel, up more than 37 per cent over the last three weeks.Soyabeans rose to within reach of a record set in July 2008, hitting a session peak of $16.44½ a bushel, up 4.6 per cent.The jump in prices will hurt chicken processors such as Tyson Foods, Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim’s Pride, which is controlled by Brazil’s JBS. Poultry eat more than 40 per cent of the meal crushed from US soyabeans, according to Bill Roenigk, chief economist at the National Chicken Council.Meal prices soared along with broader grain markets as drought and temperatures of more than 100F (38C) were forecast to continue in US corn belt states such as Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, threatening crop yields.Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer of Sanderson Farms of Mississippi, said feed made up 55 per cent of the company’s cost of goods sold. It had locked in soyameal costs only through to the end of July.“At the end of the day, chickens eat corn and soyabean meal. There are no viable substitutes.” he said. “So we and others in our industry will have no choice but to pay a higher cost to feed our chickens. If history proves a reasonable guide, high-priced grain means high-priced meat at some point in the future”.“If you know how to do a rain dance, I encourage you to do so,” said Mr Cockrell.Tyson Foods told analysts in May that it had bought soyameal “four to five weeks out”, suggesting it could be vulnerable. The company declined to comment.The rally in corn and soyabean prices also dragged wheat prices higher. CBOT July wheat rose 5.2 per cent to $8.22½ a bushel, the highest since May 2011, when the market was still wrestling with the impact of an export ban in Russia.Mr Roenigk said many chicken companies had bought into early projections of large crops in the US and refrained from locking in feed costs. “Every day that goes by when it doesn’t rain in the Midwest, companies are realising that they should have bought. But plenty of them didn’t,” he said.
72;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Brazil looks to beef up its business;;From his office on an outer ring-road of São Paulo, Wesley Mendonça Batista, chief executive of JBS, is looking to steer Brazil’s biggest meatpacker by revenue deeper into emerging markets.Since he and his brother Joesly launched a series of mergers and acquisitions in the US and Australia that created the world’s largest meat exporter, times have been tough.Shrinking US, Australian and European cow herds, depressed economic conditions and declining beef consumption for health reasons in advanced economies has been hard on margins.“We can grow in a double-digit way our revenue but we need to be more focused, to look to areas in which we can grow more profitably,” Mr Batista says, citing growth markets such as the Middle East, north Africa, Russia and the former Soviet Union.However, any expansion into these markets will not go uncontested. Mr Batista and rival meatpackers in Brazil, such as Minerva and Marfrig, or in the US, such as Tyson Foods, have a newcomer to contend with – India.Led by Alanna & Sons, a Dubai-based exporter of Indian beef, mainly water buffalo, Indian companies have gained share in the global beef industry quickly, albeit at the discount end of the market.Indian beef exports are expected to reach 1.525m tonnes this year from only 609m tonnes in 2009, outstripping world leaders Australia and Brazil, according to US Department of Agriculture figures.This has come in spite of stagnation in overall global production of beef and veal, which is down 2.4 per cent from its peak in 2007, before the financial crisis, the USDA says.“Although you have the middle classes consuming more beef in developing countries like Brazil, you have developed economies such as the EU and the US with declining rates of beef consumption,” says Gabriel Vaz de Lima, an analyst with Barclays in São Paulo, who recently rated JBS “underweight” because of negative meatpacking spreads in the US.In the US, a brutal drought in Texas last year resulted in the smallest herd the US has had since 1952, although meatier cows partially offset the decline in population.US cattle futures hit records earlier this year, while domestic beef demand has taken a hit from the weak economy, changing consumer tastes and a controversy over additives used in the production of meat trimmings used in ground beef, known pejoratively as “pink slime”.Cargill, one of four large US beef processors, reported weaker meat results in the beginning of the year because of what it called a “cyclical downturn in North American beef”, while Tyson Foods broke even in beef in its latest quarter amid what it called “extremely challenging market conditions”.“Domestic demand for beef did not match what packers were paying on cattle prices,” says Bob Wilson, analyst at HedgersEdge, an agricultural market research service.With the US now in high summer “grilling season”, domestic consumption is expected to pick up. Operating profits for US meat packers have rebounded to about $25 a head, from a loss of $112 a head as recently as April, says HedgersEdge.US beef processors are turning to overseas markets to fill the gap, with export volumes last year breaking records, according to the US Meat Export Federation.International producers, such as JBS, are fortunate to have had the booming Brazilian market to offset problems in the US. Brazilian ranchers are expanding their herds, resulting in greater supply for meatpackers.“We are seeing the opposite of what is happening in the US – cattle prices have fallen 5-7 per cent, there is higher availability of supply,” says Mr Vaz de Lima of Barclays.While Brazilian exporters such as JBS will increasingly encounter products from Indian exporters in emerging markets, producers on the subcontinent will face their own challenges.They will need to move up the value chain to command higher prices and they will continually need to reassure a religiously sensitive domestic Hindu population that no cow meat is being exported. Several Indian states ban the slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred for Hindus.“There is no exact data on the amount of [cow] beef being slaughtered and sold as people fear violent attacks from Hindus,” says a Mumbai-based executive of a food processing group. But he added it could be as much as 5 per cent.Prakash Javadekar, a senior member of India’s Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, says violence against people slaughtering cows was not justifiable. But it would be difficult to restrain those who believed cows were holy. “This is our religion. People should respect this,” says Mr Javadekar.
73;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;‘Pink slime’ fears eat into Tyson;;The “pink slime” controversy that has plagued the US beef industry took a bite out of Tyson Foods’ second-quarter earnings.The biggest US meat processor by sales said on Monday that its beef sales volume fell 10.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter and that its beef business recorded a $1m operating loss.“The unwanted controversy over lean, finely textured beef temporarily destroyed demand for ground beef, and beef in general, virtually overnight,” James Lochner, Tyson’s chief operating officer, said on a conference call with analysts.The beef industry has been under pressure this year over a public outcry against an additive known as “lean, finely textured beef”. The additive, known pejoratively as “pink slime”, is often found in ground beef and is made from beef trimmings that are processed with ammonia to make them lean and free of bacteria.The beef industry was dealt another blow last month when US agriculture officials confirmed a new case of mad cow disease in California. The discovery sent cattle prices down sharply because of fears that global beef demand would wane.Tyson said on Monday that cattle prices had rebounded but that the company had experienced “extreme margin compression” in March and early April.Backlash against the so-called “pink slime” filling caused Beef Products Inc to suspend production in three of its plants. Mr Lochner said at a conference in March that the negative publicity was hitting ground beef demand and that BPI's move would create a shortfall in beef supply.“It’s a very unfortunate thing because it was a very safe, very wholesome, very nutritious product that will now be not available to the consuming public,” Mr Lochner said.In spite of pressure on its beef business, Tyson’s net income rose 6.4 per cent year-on-year to $166m, or 44 cents a share. Sales rose 2.5 per cent to $8.2bn.High feed costs have been putting pressure on Tyson to raise prices, but the beef controversy has made this increasingly difficult.However, Tyson said that it expected a decline in industry production this year to make it easier for the company to raise chicken prices. Tyson made an operating profit of $145m in its chicken business and $115m from pork.The results were better than Wall Street analysts expected, and Tyson’s shares closed up 3.3 per cent at $18.63.

AIG will purchase $2bn worth of the latest offering which is valued at $5bn.The S&P 500 moved fractionally higher to 1,369.58 as stocks held steady despite some fears that election results in France and Greece would add further instability to markets.The benchmark US index is looking to recover its losses from last week when it dropped 2.4 per cent, as shares declined heavily on Friday ahead of the European elections.The Vix Index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 1.6 per cent to 18.85. Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays, said: “The elections were as expected and will only serve to bring attention to the broader issue of slowing economic growth, not due to austerity. The culprit is excess debt and the resultant deleveraging in the banking system.”He added: “The current debate about growth or austerity is a red herring; the markets are not going to fund additional spending by governments that already spend at a rate of 50 per cent of gross domestic product.”The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.1 per cent to 2,957.76.Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, moved 0.8 per cent higher to $569.48 as the company’s shares look to recover from last week’s decline of 6.4 per cent.Shares in Cognizant Technology Solutions were among the leading decliners as the outsourcing company said its full-year sales and earnings would come in below expectations.Cognizant lost 19.2 per cent to $56.31 as it said demand had cooled for its services heading into the second-quarter.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group by revenues, announced on Monday that it would enter the fast-growing home automation market with a portfolio of new services, including remote energy and water controls.The company, which is seeking to expand its services offering beyond its traditional range, will join rival Verizon, which launched its own home-monitoring business in October.Shares in AT&T were 0.4 per cent higher to $33. Verizon shares gained 0.7 per cent to $40.53 on the day.Yahoo, the internet search and media company, moved 1.3 per cent higher to $15.35 as it sought to dealwith calls for its recently appointed chief executive to resign. Dissident investors have urged Yahoo’s board to fire Scott Thompson for misinformation about his educational qualifications on his personal résumé.B-class shares in Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by Warren Buffett, rose 1.9 per cent to $82.47 following its annual meeting where the chief executive said the size of recent acquisitions paled in comparison to those his successor would need to make. Mr Buffett, who still has not publicly named his successor, also described his diagnosis of prostate cancer as a “non-event”.Tyson Foods, the US meat producer, was among the leading gainers after it said second-quarter earnings rose despite climbing beef prices.The company reported first-quarter net income of $166m, or 44 cents a share, up from $156m over the same period a year ago. Shares in Tyson gained 3.3 per cent to $18.62.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 per cent to 13,008.53. Earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar lost 1.3 per cent to $97.19.Ahead of its second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, Walt Disney Co jumped 2.1 per cent to $43.82. The entertainment group’s latest film, The Avengers, generated over $200m in sales in its opening weekend. The US opening lifted the worldwide total for the film to $642m after only 12 days on release.The S&P 500 financial index was leading the major sectors, rising 0.7 per cent. Bank of America was ahead of its rivals and added 2.8 per cent to $7.94, but in recent weeks the company has moved well below its highest point for the year at roughly $10.The S&P 500 energy index was 0.2 per cent lower.

76;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-08-22T22:46:53Z;Buyers fight $1.1bn Innkeepers hotel deal;;Cerberus, the private equity group, and Chatham Lodging Trust are trying to walk away from their $1.1bn deal to buy 64 hotels from bankrupt chain Innkeepers, arguing that the business had undergone a so-called “material adverse change”, enabling them to terminate their contract.The pair, which in May were selected as the winning bidders for Innkeepers’ hotels, said that they had terminated their agreement to buy the hotels on Friday. They pointed to language in the deal’s terms that enabled them to walk away should a “condition, change or development” threaten to have a “material adverse effect” on the Innkeepers business.People familiar with the matter said that the Innkeepers properties had been performing steadily in the past few weeks and saw no deterioration that would merit the buyers’ claiming a “material adverse effect” from the weakness in the economy or volatility in the markets.The US courts have taken a dim view in the past when buyers have attempted to use MAC or MAE clauses to stop deals.In 2001, the Delaware Chancery Court said that Tyson could not use a MAC to get out of its deal to buy beef processor IBP. The chancellor, Leo Strine, argued that a “short term hiccup in earnings should not suffice” in justifying the occurrence of a MAC and that a longer-term test was appropriate.The attempt by Hexion, the industrial company owned by Apollo, to use a MAC to walk away from its 2007 deal to buy Huntsman in the midst of the financial crisis was also unsuccessful.Cerberus and Chatham made the decision to terminate their agreement with Innkeepers’ jointly, people familiar with the matter said. However, they had not provided any further information as to the basis for their claiming a material adverse change, others added.The $1.125bn that Cerberus and Chatham offered to pay for the properties included the assumption of $725m in mortgage debt on 45 of the properties. Cerberus agreed to provide most of the cash needed for the deal, with Chatham set to take a 9 per cent stake in the pair’s joint venture and contributing about $37m.Chatham separately agreed to purchase five hotels from Innkeepers for $195m, a deal that closed in July.Innkeepers on Monday had yet to respond to the decision by Cerberus and Chatham. The auction for the 64 hotels earlier this year also attracted interest from other parties, including Five Mile Capital Partners, an alternative investment company with about $2bn in assets under management.
77;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-08-08T20:22:58Z;Bank and energy stocks lead US declines;;US stocks took a steep dive on Monday as traders reacted late in the session to the US credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, with the benchmark S&P experiencing its biggest one-day fall since December 2008.The benchmark S&P 500 slumped 6.7 per cent to 1,119.68, its lowest level in 11 months, with banks on the index targeted by traders fearful of the perceived weakness of the US economy.The volume of shares traded was also high, as the verdict on the downgrade – which signalled a lack of confidence in the US economy – was handed down in dramatic fashion.It followed heavy losses in the previous week, the worst for US stocks in two years, as fears over the strength of the recovery came to the fore.Smaller company shares fared the worst on Monday as the Nasdaq Composite index sunk 6.9 per cent to 2,357.69. The Russell 2000 index of small and mid-cap groups dropped 7.9 per cent.The main indices had been bolstered briefly on Friday by indications that the European Central Bank would buy Italian and Spanish debt.That continued to shield stocks from a more precipitous fall early in the session before a late sell-off after Barack Obama, US president, made an afternoon speech on the credit downgrade that traders felt lacked conviction.Bank of America  was the biggest faller on the S&P 500, plummeting 20.1 per cent to $6.75 after American International Group filed a lawsuit against the bank for loses incurred on mortgage-backed securities.Citigroup also dropped 15.8 per cent to $28.16, while Genworth Financial sank 16.8 per cent to $5.64.Energy stocks again also saw steep declines, dropping 3.3 per cent in the opening minutes of trading as oil and gas prices fell. Stocks directly tied to the economy were also targeted in the sell-off.Alpha Natural Resources, the coal producer, continued its downward slide after second-quarter losses last week, slumping a further 18.5 per cent to $26.35.Valero Energy, the pertroleum company, was also down 11.6 per cent to $18.31, while US Steel lost 13.1 per cent to $28.84.Sunoco, another petroleum company that last week admitted it had just finished an “abysmal” quarter, fell a further 11.6 per cent to $30.08.But a new record for gold saw shares of Newmont Mining, a producer of the precious metal, lose just 0.5 per cent to $54.13 a share. Newmont shares were among the few to post gains last week, adding 0.2 per cent.Large-cap shares were not targeted as hard, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 5.6 per cent to 10,809.85.It was heavily weighed by the steep drop in shares of Bank of America, but strategists at UBS and Morgan Stanley recommended shifts into large-cap growth shares as a defensive move.Tyson Foods, the only S&P 500 company reporting earnings, was down 3.7 per cent at $15.71 despite the meat and poultry seller topped earnings expectations for the quarter, earning 46 cents a share versus forecasts of 39 cents.Dean Foods, which unlike Tyson primarily uses agricultural commodities as inputs, saw its shares drop 7.3 per cent to $8.40, among the worst performers in the S&P 500.Despite the day’s losses, strategists were broadly arguing that the rating agency’s downgrade was not a strong direct catalyst for share prices, which globally enjoyed their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis amid slowing economic growth in big economies and worries about European sovereign debt.“Today’s tape is going to look worse than it should,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas, a research firm. “Did S&P really tell us something we didn’t know?“Corporates are the new sovereigns with so much cash on their balance sheets. That kind of goes out the window for a day or two here as we sort out where Treasuries will be priced but I don’t think this will have an impact on companies.”Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird, suggested that there could be a case for a turnround, given that investor sentiment as measured by the American Association of Individual Investors showed a drop in the percentage of retail investors surveyed calling themselves “bears” – marking a bottom for the widely followed indicator.“The equity markets are extremely oversold and investor fear is beginning to creep in,” he said.However, he warned: “Until the momentum is interrupted by two sessions where upside volume overwhelms downside volume by a ratio of at least 10 to one, investors should be defensive.”Elsewhere, Priceline.com, the discount travel website, among the best market performers of the past two years, fell back after big jumps last week as its earnings and travel bookings came in ahead of expectations. Its stock dropped 4.3 per cent to $505.00.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone company, extended its recent slump, falling 15.9 per cent to $3.13, in spite of announcing that it would launch its new 4G model, priced at less than $100, later this month.
78;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-08-08T17:49:55Z;Rising grain costs restrict Tyson’s growth;;Tyson Foods, the largest US meat processor by revenues, blamed weak economic growth, high levels of unemployment and the rising costs of feeding chickens for a lacklustre third quarter.Donnie Smith, chief executive of Tyson, said that fragile macroeconomic conditions combined with a swollen supply of chicken and elevated corn prices meant that its chicken business could suffer a loss in the current quarter.“The fact that we remained profitable in such a difficult environment demonstrates how much our chicken business has improved in the past three years,” Mr Smith said. “There appears to be improvement in market fundamentals on the horizon but the next few months will be very challenging.”Net income at Tyson fell by 22 per cent from a year ago to $188m, or 51 cents a share. Sales rose 10.9 per cent year on year to $8.2bn.The results exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and Tyson’s shares rose 1.23 per cent to $16.51 in midday trading on Monday.Pork and beef sales propped up Tyson in the third quarter, thanks to greater international demand for those products. But the chicken business remained soft, and Tyson said that it would need to raise prices to keep up with rising grain costs.“We’re focused on pricing because the current situation is simply unsustainable,” Mr Smith said in a conference call with analysts. “We believe we’re adjusting to a new paradigm.”Operating profit in the chicken business was just $28m, while operating profit for beef and pork was $140m and $124m respectively.Corn and soyabean prices have increased by 10 cents a pound in the past two years. Mr Smith said that besides price increases, Tyson would look to diversify its chicken business and would be reducing the weight of its eight-pound “big bird” chickens because the costs of feeding them have become exorbitant.Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast that it will be a “long road” back to profitability in the chicken business and that Tyson should raise prices gradually.According to Fitch, the rating agency, excess supply and weak pricing will continue to put the chicken industry under pressure.“High grain costs will continue to cause margin pressure in the near term but recent pullbacks in production could signal capitulation for the chicken producers,” said Carla Norfleet Taylor, director at Fitch.Tyson said that while the US market continued to face headwinds, it was stepping up its efforts to invest in Brazil, China and Mexico.
79;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-06-01T19:26:19Z;Sealed Air wraps up Diversey deal;The acquisition provides Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new area;Journalists seeking cheap puns about a bubble in mergers and acquisitions and spurious claims of diversification were handed a gift with Sealed Air’s agreement to purchase cleaning products company Diversey on Wednesday. Just as obvious, the maker of Bubble Wrap mentioned that the transaction would be accretive in the first year and it trotted out venn diagrams to highlight overlapping customers such as Walmart, Coca-Cola and Tyson Foods. But, in this era of ultra-low interest rates, nearly any deal with a substantial cash component should boost earnings per share initially and it is hardly surprising that two large companies would have customers in common in food manufacturing and retail.The acquisition does provide Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new and not wholly-unrelated area. Though synergies are modest at just $50m per annum or just over 1 per cent of the $4.3bn purchase price, the adjusted trailing multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation is 8.7 times, about three-quarters of competitors Ecolab and Procter & Gamble. Diversey, which mainly sells hygiene products to large buyers, is less profitable than both, but margins have been on a clear upward trend under the guidance of penny-pinching private equity shareholders.Will Diversey do even better under new ownership or has it already been put in as flattering a condition as possible? That is unclear and Sealed Air’s own spotty record of shareholder wealth generation – essentially zero since the beginning of 2000 – does not inspire. Management would hardly admit that it wants Diversey for growth’s sake or because bankers were dangling cheap financing, but it is hard to avoid that impression. Much like Sealed Air’s most famous product though, the deal only provides a firm underpinning as long as bubbles stay inflated.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
80;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-05-12T21:05:14Z;Upbeat jobs figures lift Wall Street;;Cisco Systems lost ground after issuing a profit warning, while the wider markets edged higher after broadly positive economic data and firmer commodity prices helped to lift investor sentiment.Shares in Cisco fell 4.8 per cent to $16.93 after the world’s largest producer of networking gear by revenues announced that its sales and profits in the current quarter would come in below expectations.The company also reported that its net income had fallen 18 per cent in its last quarter to $1.8bn, or 42 cents a share. This was broadly in line with expectations.News of the profit warning weighed on related technology stocks. Motorola Mobility fell 1.1 per cent to $24.98 while Harrislost 1.4 per cent to $48.29. The S&P technology equipment sector was down 0.7 per cent, although in the broader tech sector most stocks were up.Looking at the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,348.65, paring some of the 1.1 per cent losses in the previous session, with sentiment helped by upbeat employment data.Figures from the Labor Department showed that 44,000 fewer Americans applied for unemployment insurance last week.The number of new claims fell to 434,000, which was a bigger drop than had been expected and was the steepest fall since February 2010.It also reversed much of the sharp increase in claims in the previous week. But other data in the session were less positive, showing that the higher oil and food costs were hitting retail spending and lifting producer prices.The 0.5 per cent rise in retail sales in April and the 0.8 per cent rise in inflation were both slightly worse than the markets had been expecting.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,696.14 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent to 2,863.04.The energy sectors were again lower in the session, as traders remained uneasy following the recent volatility in the oil markets.Within the energy sector Murphy Oil fell 1.3 per cent to $66.63 while ConocoPhillips declined 1.4 per cent to $71.53. The broader S&P energy sector closed down only 0.1 per cent, however, after the oil priced edged a little higher. The S&P energy sector has fallen 7.2 per cent this month.Consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks saw some of the biggest gains in a possible sign that some stocks are beginning to benefit from the recent drop in oil prices.Among the stocks to gain in these sectors, Tyson Foods was up 4.6 per cent to $18.84 while Mead Johnson added 2.1 per cent to $67.72. Best Buy rose 4.1 per cent to $31.69.The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 0.9 per cent and the consumer stable index added 1.3 per cent.The financial sector was one of the worst performing of the session, led by Goldman Sachs. Shares in the investment bank were down 3.5 per cent to $142.1 after pair of analyst notes downgraded the stock, warning investors that Goldman could still face charges from the US Justice Department for its behaviour during the financial crisis.Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $42.42, adding to the 5 per cent losses already this week after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.The S&P financial index was down 0.1, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session as the afternoon continued.Elsewhere, shares in First Solar rose 6.3 per cent to $132.07, the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index, after the maker of thin-film solar modules received letters indicating support from the US Energy Department for three projects in California.Shares in Symantec added 5.2 per cent to $20.42 after the maker of security software reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 2 cents.VeriSign, the company best known for the management of internet domain names, was up 3.2 per cent to $36.68 after saying that it had resolved a lawsuit.Clearwire, a wireless broadband provider, fell 15.6 per cent to $3.99 after Intel said that it would sell 10m shares in the company.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Kohl’s added 3.9 per cent to $55.68 after the retailer reported a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast for the year.
81;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
82;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-05-09T21:43:58Z;Tyson: beefing up prices may be fowl;The US meat producer believes chicken prices may benefit as beef soars;"The American carnivore may be eating a bit less red meat these days, but he (and it often is a he) has proved surprisingly willing to pay up for the pleasure.As the commodities boom has roared, steaks and pork chops have gone along for the ride, together with the grains that are meat producers’ main inputs. Yet Tyson Foods has largely been able to protect margins, using price. The US meat producer on Monday reported its fourth straight quarter in which average prices for both beef and pork were up well over 10 per cent, while volumes have stayed relatively stable. Beef prices for the most recent quarter were up just under 20 per cent; volumes were down less than 1 per cent.Tyson is not an isolated case. On the same morning, the restaurant-supply company Sysco reported better than expected sales driven by success in passing food price inflation through to customers while simultaneously growing volumes.But while the American consumer hasn’t broken, he is bending. Though calories consumed appear at least stable, judging from waistlines, meat produced for the US market has been on a slow decline for four years. According to government data it has fallen from 283 pounds per capita in 2007 to an expected 263 pounds in 2011. Producers have been more cautious and export markets are taking up the slack.Tyson’s leadership noted that, if red meat prices outrun consumer appetites over time, chicken prices (which have not been as strong) will benefit from demand for cheaper alternatives. Corn and meat prices have backed off a bit in recent weeks, but if this welcome trend reverses, the American consumer may start to crack – and the first fissures may appear in the form of a fowl taste.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
83;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-05-09T20:47:04Z;Tyson warns on rising food costs;;Tyson Foods, the US meat producer, warned on Monday that rising foods costs were eating into consumer confidence and said that higher grain prices would cost the company half a billion dollars this year.Donald Smith, Tyson’s chief executive, said US consumers were making more frequent trips to smaller retail stores in an effort to manage cash flow more efficiently but that the company would continue raising prices to combat the soaring costs it faces for animal feed.“Consumers are likely to remain conservative and hold on to many of the behaviours they adopted in the early stages of the recession,” Mr Smith said, pointing to data from Nielsen that showed slumping consumer sentiment.Although Tyson painted a downbeat picture of the US consumer, its second-quarter results show sales volumes holding their own in spite of price increases. During the second quarter Tyson raised prices by 12.3 per cent from a year ago and on Monday maintained its 2011 outlook of $32bn in sales, up from $28.4bn last year.Sales volumes of chicken and pork recorded solid increases during the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, while beef sales slipped as consumers sought cheaper forms of protein.But Tyson increased beef prices by almost 20 per cent during the quarter, and only recorded a 0.6 per cent dip in sales volume.Meanwhile, pork prices rose 18.4 per cent and sales remained strong, rising by 6.6 per cent. Tyson made the smallest price increases to chicken, raising them by 3.7 per cent year-on-year. Demand for the meat remained solid, with sales volumes up 6 per cent.Tyson said it would focus this year on shifting production away from chicken exports and concentrate on the US market. According to Mr Smith, the tough economic climate would drive domestic appetite for the cheaper dark chicken meat later this year.Net income at Tyson was flat from a year ago during the second quarter at $156m, or 42 cents a share, and revenues rose 3 per cent to $8bn. The results trailed estimates of Wall Street analysts and its shares fell 6.19 per cent to $17.72 in midday trading.In spite of rising grain and corn prices, Tyson has so far succeeded at passing higher input costs on to consumers and said it would continue to raise meat prices“We’ve got a wall of costs coming at us,” Mr Smith said in a call with analysts.
84;TSN;Tyson Foods;2011-01-07T01:23:10Z;Poultry ‘titan’ Donald Tyson dies;;Donald Tyson, who helped build his family’s Arkansas chicken hatchery into one of the world’s largest meat producers, has died of cancer at the age of 80.In a career that spanned five decades, Mr Tyson transformed Tyson Foods through serial acquisitions from one of many chicken producers – it was 14th in size in the US in 1968 – to the country’s largest.In 1968, it supplied 1 per cent of the country’s chicken. Last year, Tyson accounted for 20 per cent of chicken consumed in the US, according to the National Chicken Council.Mr Tyson served as chairman emeritus when his son engineered the acquisition of IBP, a leading producer of meat and pork, in 2001, after which Tyson Foods became the world’s largest meat company. In 2009, Brazil-based JBS eclipsed Tyson, taking over the number-one spot after its acquisition of Bertin and Pilgrim’s Pride.Like Frank Perdue, another major figure in the development of the industry in the US, Mr Tyson benefited from the steady growth in chicken consumption across America in the latter half of the 20th century. Mr Tyson was not well known outside the industry, or politics, where he was an active player for much of his career.In 1980, Mr Tyson helped the company develop a relationship with McDonald’s, supplying chicken meat for the restaurant chain’s experimental new product, the “Chicken McNugget”. The relationship continues to this day.In a statement, the National Chicken Council described Mr Tyson as “a titan of the modern chicken industry”, praising him as a visionary in the business. “He was a pioneer in moving beyond commodity chicken to value-added products and in the development of new products and international markets.”In the 1980s, the success of Tyson Foods and Arkansas-based Walmart, bolstered the national credentials of the state’s Democratic governor, Bill Clinton. Mr Tyson was a financial supporter of Mr Clinton during his presidential campaign in 1992.In 1997, Tyson Foods admitted giving $12,000 of illegal gratuities to Mike Espy, who had served as secretary of agriculture under President Clinton, and paid $6m in fines and costs. As part of the plea agreement, Mr Tyson and his son John were granted immunity from prosecution.
85;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
86;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-11-22T18:51:40Z;Wall Street losses led by financials;;The financial sector led US stocks lower as the Irish bail-out spread fears of further problems for European banks.The S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 1,192.90 by midday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.7 per cent to 11,121.63. But the Nasdaq Composite was a fraction higher at 2,519.23.The S&P 500 financials index fell 1.4 per cent and Morgan Stanley was lower by 3.1 per cent to $24.83, JPMorgan Chase was down 1.9 per cent to $38.66 and Goldman Sachs fell 3.2 per cent to $161.30.US-listed shares in Irish banks, which have fallen sharply in recent weeks, tumbled with Allied Irish Bank losing 5.7 per cent to $1.16 and Bank of Ireland sinking 16.9 per cent to $2.22.A decision by eurozone finance ministers, along with the UK and Sweden, to bail out Ireland with an €80bn-€90bn package, failed to calm investors, who began to worry about the possibility of contagion. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, said the banking sector had been the primary problem for Ireland so there would now be renewed concern across Europe about bank funding.“No Irish bank failed the EU’s stress tests, results of which were published in July,” he said. “Clearly, the methodology employed in those tests was not adequate to give early warning of potential trouble.“The fear will be that, if the stress tests failed to identify the flaws in Ireland’s banking system, what other problems might there be that went undetected during the EU’s exercise? Whatever reassurance the stress tests afforded when their results were published has been forfeited.”Financial stocks were also hit by two other reports. A BarCap study said that the top 35 US banks will be short of between $100bn and $150bn in equity capital when the new Basel III global bank regulations are implemented and it was also reported that federal authorities may file a series of insider trading cases against hedge fund traders, consultants and Wall Street bankers.But Amazon and Apple climbed, helping the Nasdaq into positive territory. Amazon said it had developed an application for Apple’s iPhone which allowed shoppers to compare the prices of goods in stores with those on its websites. Amazon rose 2.1 per cent to $168.26 and Apple gained 0.9 per cent to $309.44.In deal news, Novell jumped 6.5 per cent to $5.96 after Attachmate, an investment group, agreed to buy the software maker for $2.2bn. The price of $6.10 per share is at a 9.1 per cent premium to the share’s closing price on Friday. The software maker had rejected a $2bn offer by Elliott Associates made in March. Novell will also sell some intellectual property assets to a group of technology companies led by Microsoft for $450m. Shares in Microsoft slid 0.4 per cent to $25.59.Boeing fell 0.7 per cent to $63.16, less than the wider industrials index, after it said it could acquire privately owned Summit Aeronautics. The deal to buy the company, which supplies titanium and other hard metal structures for aircraft, was for an undisclosed sum.Takeover battles for Dynegy and Genzyme rumbled on. Dynegy fell 2 per cent to $5.01 after Blackstone Group, which has bid for the energy company, said it considers its offer to be fair and is not prepared to raise it again. Blackstone edged up 0.5 per cent to $13.31.Genzyme added 0.7 per cent to $71.78 after it was reported that the pharmaceutical company was considering a new deal structure with French company Sanofi-Aventis. The two companies have been in an acquisition battle since the summer. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis fell 1.6 per cent to $33.58.As the earnings season drew to a close Tyson Foods was one of the last companies to report. The food producer gained 4.1 per cent to $16.29 after its gross margins jumped. Earnings beat expectations but sales were lower than forecast as volumes fell across all of the meat company’s businesses.Hewlett-Packard nudged up 0.6 per cent to $42.75 ahead of its earnings due to be released after the closing bell.
87;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-10-11T02:39:01Z;US corn shortage seen to raise meat prices;;A surprise contraction in the US corn supply will push up beef, pork and chicken prices in what parts of the industry warn will be a “game changer”.With the US harvest halfway through, the US Department of Agriculture said the average corn field will yield 155.8 bushels per acre, 6.7 bushels less than its September estimate.“The impact of this is huge, a complete game changer,” says Gregg Doud, chief economist of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “This is an all-time record change in corn yield from one month to the next. We were caught completely flat-footed.”The season-average farm price for corn, an integral part of the diet of protein animals, is projected to rise by 60 cents a bushel to between $4.60 and $5.40.The beef industry is only this year recovering from the commodity price spikes of 2007 and 2008 – events that led to a dramatic diminution of the number of cattle raised for slaughter.Mr Doud said the spike in corn prices would push the cost of breeding cattle beyond the point where those costs could be passed along to consumers.The impact on chicken producers was immediate. Shares of Tyson – the top chicken producer in the US – dropped by almost 8 per cent, closing at $15.01 on Friday.With unemployment at almost 10 per cent, many food marketers are reluctant to pass on costs. That will have to change, says Heather Jones, an agribusiness analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.“You’ve got to pass this along to consumers,” said Ms Jones. As for the beef supply, she adds that “ cattle herds are in contraction worldwide and with feed prices like this, don’t expect expansion”.Steve Meyer, of Paragon Economics, said the price spike would discourage expansion in the pig industry too. “Instead of seeing retail prices come down, they’ll stay up for the foreseeable future.”However, chickens could grow their “share of stomach” as a result of lean times in other meat industries. Bill Roenigk, an economist at the National Chicken Council, expects the population of broiler chickens (chickens bred for meat) to expand by 3 per cent next year.According to FreshLook Data, the price of beef in the US rose by almost 6 per cent in the three months to August 22. Pork prices jumped more than 8 per cent, while chicken prices rose by less than 2 per cent.
88;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-10-08T21:06:53Z;Soaring prices threaten new food crisis;;Fears of a global food crisis swept the world’s commodity markets as prices for staples such as corn, rice and wheat spiralled after the US government warned of “dramatically” lower supplies.An especially hot summer in the US, droughts in countries including Russia and Brazil and heavy rain in Canada and Europe have hit many grain and oilseed crops this year. This has raising concern of a severe squeeze in food supplies and a repeat of the 2007-08 food crisis.The US Department of Agriculture, in a closely watched report, predicted that the country’s stocks of corn would halve to their lowest levels in 14 years.It warned of a “much tighter supply picture” for corn and barley, the two main feedstocks used to fatten cows, sheep, pigs and poultry.Shares in some of the world’s biggest meat packers tumbled. US-listed Tyson Foods fell 7.7 per cent. Shares in other food producers also declined.“I think we have a food crisis right now,” said Hussein Allidina, head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley.In Chicago, the prices of agricultural commodities jumped so sharply that they hit limits imposed on daily movement by the city’s futures exchange, the biggest in the world.Traders, unable to use futures contracts because of the limits on trading, bid indicative corn prices to $5.65 a bushel in the options market, a rise of 13.3 per cent on the day.In Paris, European wheat prices rose 10 per cent, while the cost of other commodities including soyabeans, sugar, cotton, barley and oats soared.The rise in prices sent the Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodities index to a two-year high.The USDA shocked traders by forecasting in its monthly report that the country’s corn farmers would harvest about 12.7bn bushels in the 2010-11 crop year that started in September. This is down 4 per cent from the USDA’s previous estimate.The drop would slash the country’s stocks to 900m bushels, the lowest level since 1996-97. The USDA also cut wheat and soya production estimates.“This revision highlights that we are in a very fragile supply and demand situation,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome.The US is the world’s largest corn grower and its exports make up the majority of global trade in the grain. The USDA had earlier forecast a record corn crop this year but a combination of unfavourable heat and heavy rains forced a re-evaluation of yields.The fall in supplies has prompted countries such as Russia and Ukraine to impose export restrictions on grains.Big importers in the Middle East and North Africa have started to hoard supplies, which has further tightened the market.
89;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-09-17T21:08:22Z;Wall Street rally runs out of steam;;Better-than-expected earnings from technology companies Research in Motion and Oracle failed to push the US stock market indices out of their summer trading range.The S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,125.65 by the close on Friday and up 1.5 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,607.93, rising 1.4 per cent over the five days, but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,315.61, rising 3.2 per cent over the week.The S&P 500 briefly pierced the key resistance level of 1,130 on Friday but quickly fell back.In September, the US consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to its weakest level in more than a year, while in August, the consumer price index showed inflation pressures were muted.“I think a lot of people saw this week [as] full of data and thought it looked pretty market-moving, with critical levels to break,” said Dan Cook, senior markets analyst at IG Markets, “but we’re still at those levels and its been like watching paint dry.”He added that this week’s economic data have been mixed but there has not been much of a reaction, even to the most negative releases – possibly because people wanted to stay in the market just in case the Federal Reserve announced fresh quantitative easing at its meeting next week.The S&P 500 information technology index, which has been the biggest riser so far this month, climbed further. The sector was up 0.5 per cent after earnings, reported after the closing bell on Thursday, pointed to a recovery in corporate spending on information technology.Oracle climbed 8.4 per cent to $27.48 after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly profit. The company said sales in the current quarter would be at least $8.4bn, above analysts’ estimates.Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, rose 0.5 per cent to $46.72 after it beat expectations on both quarterly sales and profit.Shares in Research in Motion have fallen 31.4 per cent so far this year on the back of concerns that the BlackBerry handset could be squeezed out by the rise of Apple’s iPhone and potential bans in countries from Abu Dhabi to India.Also in technology, Texas Instruments boosted its quarterly dividend and said it would repurchase $7.5bn of its stock in another round of buy-backs. Its shares rose 3 per cent to $25.72.Elsewhere, shares in meat-processing companies fell after the price of corn, which is used to feed animals, rose to its highest level in two years.Shares in Tyson Foods dropped 6.9 per cent to $15.85 and Smithfield Foods slid 2.5 per cent to $16.34.In materials, US-listed shares in steel company ArcelorMittal rose 1 per cent to $32.83 after it said it would meet its third-quarter forecasts, even though many of its rivals have reduced projections.But some companies lowered their forecasts with Massey Energy retreating 7.5 per cent to $29.94 after the coal producer projected an operating loss for its third quarter and said it expected its 2010 results to come in at the lower end of its predictions.In deal news, Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare product group, said it planned to offer $2.3bn for the shares that it does not own in Dutch companyCrucell.The two groups already have a partnership to develop flu vaccines and therapies. The deal, which has been recommended by Crucell’s board, values the company at €24.75 a share, a 58 per cent premium on Thursday’s closing price.US-listed shares in Crucell jumped 55.9 per cent to $32.02 and J&J nudged up 0.5 per cent to $61.57.Investors snapped up shares in SouFun, the operator of a Chinese real estate website, pushing it up 72.9 per cent to $73.50 in its first day of trading. The first US initial public offering this month, it raised $125m.
90;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-08-20T20:04:15Z;Barbecues trigger stampede in cattle prices;Resurgent food cost fears weigh on market;Americans face higher beef prices for their traditional end-of-summer Labor Day barbecues following a late-night stampede by meat packers this week that helped send cattle futures to their highest levels in nearly two years.Negotiations between slaughterhouses and feedyard operators with cattle to sell took on a frantic tone this week, with talks stretching late into the night on Wednesday – a rare occurrence for cattlemen used to wrapping up their affairs by sundown.“[Wednesday] night may have been the latest bidding I have ever seen,” said John Josserand, president of AzTx Cattle in Hereford, Texas, which operates facilities that can feed 250,000 cattle at a time. By Thursday, the frenzy spread to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where live cattle trading volume broke records and futures prices jumped to $1 a pound, the highest level in 22 months.The tumultuous trading came after rallies in markets for other agricultural commodities have raised fears about global food price inflation. Wheat prices have soared as a drought in Russia destroys grain crops. CME pork bellies, used for bacon, have hit all-time highs this month.“There is growing concern that food prices are going to head north,” said Bob Goldin of Technomic, a Chicago food industry consultant. US cattle supplies have declined as ranchers culled herds to offset losses during the recession and calves emerged from the hard winter with less meat on their bones than usual.However, exports from the US, the world’s largest producer, are expected to rise 13 per cent this year, led by shipments to Japan and South Korea. Americans also appear to be regaining a taste for beef after cutting back during the economic downturn.“What’s exciting is beef demand has stabilised into the summer,” said Rich Nelson, director of research at Allendale, a futures broker in McHenry, Illinois.Meat packers bought heavily this week to secure supplies for the September 6 Labor Day holiday, Mr Nelson said.By Thursday, meat packers had bought 201,000 head of cattle across the central US, up 11 per cent from the previous week, the agriculture department said.Cargill, JBS, National Beef and Tyson Foods account for three-quarters of US beef packing activity, analysts say.
91;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-08-12T18:34:59Z;Hedging helps foodmakers through uncertainty;Derivatives are ensuring groups protect themselves from the turmoil;Imagine you supply the world’s biggest supermarket chains with breakfast cereals, bottled beer and sliced bread. Or that you are one of the world’s biggest meat producers, buying corn to feed cattle whose meat is your bottom line.Now imagine prices of wheat, corn and other agricultural commodities, which comprise much of your input costs, jump 50 per cent in a matter of weeks because of a drought in Russia that has caused catastrophic crop failure.Worse, Moscow slaps a ban on exports. That is exactly what has happened to companies such as Tyson Foods, Anheuser-Busch InBev, General Mills, Kellogg and Kraft. Contrary to the fears of many investors, however, these big food companies are likely to weather the turmoil in commodities markets.The reason? They learnt from bitter experience during the food crisis of 2007-08 and have protected themselves from the latest surge in prices by using derivatives, say bankers and industry executives.The benefits are already being felt. Companies have told investors that their commodity hedging strategies will largely insulate them from the effects of spiking wheat, corn and barley prices.In a conference call two weeks ago, when the magnitude of the Russian grain problem had become known, Kellogg executives told investors that the cereal and snack company was 90 per cent hedged on a range of commodities.Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, on Thursday said it had hedged its barley purchases through 2011, avoiding a big cost problem. The price of barley has doubled in the past month-and-a-half due to the drought in Russia and Ukraine.A few weeks earlier, before the Russian grain shortage suddenly worsened with the export ban, Don Mulligan, chief executive at General Mills, told investors that the food company was “about 50 per cent hedged” for the 2011 fiscal year, which began in June.The growing use of derivatives to lock in forward prices marks a big change from the situation multinational food producers found themselves in in 2007 and 2008, when they were caught offguard by sudden jumps in prices. Their attempts to pass on cost rises then sparked a consumer backlash.Many of the same companies that have hedged their exposures were those that suffered the last time round. Then, they were caught between rising input costs, which eroded their margins at the start of the crisis, and, later, anger at the price increases in shops, which drove customers away from their brands and into the arms of private label distributors.Bankers estimate that up to a third of the world’s largest food companies launched fresh hedging programmes in the aftermath of the 2007-08 crisis.“The price volatility we saw three years ago certainly raised the issue of ingredient cost to the boardroom,” says a banker who works closely with several large food companies. “It made chief financial officers more receptive to the ideas of hedging.”The 2007-08 crisis was for the food industry what the 1990-91 Gulf War spike in oil prices was for the world’s airlines: a wake-up call.Since then, says Will Shropshire, head of agricultural commodities at JPMorgan in London, companies “are paying more attention to price risk management and putting hedges in place”.For years, food companies did not worry too much about being caught out by unexpectedly steep price rises. Only the biggest groups hedged and, in most cases, they only bought protection for a few volatile commodities, such as coffee, sugar or cocoa.They sidelined other key agricultural commodities, from wheat and soyabeans to milk and corn, on the grounds the prices in those markets were relatively stable. Moreover, the convention in the industry was to pass on to consumers any rise in costs. Companies learnt in 2007-08 there was a limit to shoppers’ loyalty.As a result, they overhauled their forward buying practices and locked in prices through buying futures and options traded on commodities exchanges in Chicago, New York, London and Paris. They dealt directly, too, with Wall Street banks on bespoke “over-the-counter” derivatives deals that are not traded on exchanges. Bankers say most of the hedges were relatively simple compared to the more exotic derivatives common to other industries, such as natural gas or copper.The shift to hedging is work in progress. Some companies are still debating whether to use derivatives, while others have only just started. Steve Jesse, director of agricultural commodity sales at Barclays Capital in London, says the main shift in attitudes has happened over the past six to nine months.Hedging has become a strategic choice, too, rather than an opportunistic punt when, for example, prices fall.Even so, bankers say that the length of the hedges in the food industry is shorter than in other industries, such as energy or metals, where companies lock in prices up to 10 years ahead. As supplies of agricultural commodities vary each year depending on the weather, plant diseases and planting, companies are reluctant to lock in prices beyond 12-18 months.Gary Stibel, chief executive of the New England Consulting Group, warns, though, that hedging could itself lead to unexpected problems. Some multinationals, he says, bought too much protection in 2009, when prices were falling, adding to their costs then.Crises such as the one that has propelled wheat prices to their highest in nearly two years are rare. “Having some hedges is good. Having too much of a hedge is counterproductive. You’re dealing with black swan events,” he says.

93;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-08-09T18:43:32Z;Upbeat Tyson shrugs off wheat surge;;Tyson Foods on Monday shrugged off last week’s surging wheat prices and said it was confident on the outlook for the current quarter.Last week, the cereal hit a two-year high on the back of Russia’s ban on grain exports as the country’s crop has been devastated by the worst drought in more than a century.Shares in some of the world’s largest food companies tumbled on fears they would struggle to pass on the increased costs of buying wheat to households already suffering the effects of the financial crisis.However, Tyson said it had insulated itself by purchasing call options earlier this year, and that the company, which relies on corn and wheat grain to feed its livestock, was confident of this year’s corn crops in the US and Latin America.“A couple of months ago on dip, we bought some calls to protect Q4 and Q1 at somewhere in the $4 area in case something happened”, said Donnie Smith, Tyson chief executive.“If you couple that with corn, we feel very comfortable that we’ll end the fourth quarter just fine,” he went on.The comments came as Tyson Foods announced a surge in revenues for its third quarter, reflecting the increased prices it was able to command for its beef and pork products, as lower supply of those meats led to increased retail prices.Even though the volume of its pork sales was flat for the quarter over the comparable period in 2009, a price spike of 31.6 per cent resulted in a gain of $301m in revenues from the previous year’s total of $948m for the segment.It was a similar story for beef, where a 19.5 per cent rise in prices turned a 5.1 per cent decline in volume into a gain of $372m over last year’s quarterly total of $2.8bn.A decline in chicken prices during the quarter reduced the revenues generated by an 8.1 per cent increase in volume for the period.Tyson’s net profit for the quarter was $248m, up from $131m during the comparable period in 2009.Rising prices of food commodities has impacted the company in other ways.While sales in its prepared foods division grew slightly in volume, and by more than 10 per cent in revenues, Tyson’s operating margin for the division was only 2.9 per cent, well below the comparable margins for its chicken, pork and beef divisions.The company blamed the lower margins on increased costs at the unit.As for chicken, Tyson executives said they were hopeful that the Russian market would once again resume chicken imports from the US, following a temporary ban. The countries have agreed to resume trade in this area, pending a series of visits by Russian veterinary representatives to US poultry production plants.

96;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-04-28T15:50:33Z;China to hit US chicken with new tariffs;;China announced on Wednesday it would impose a second round of tariffs on imports of US chicken products of as much as 31.4 per cent, raising the temperature in the trade tussles between the two countries.The commerce ministry said the new tariffs were a response to what it said were unfair subsidies given to poultry farmers in the US. The duties come on top of tariffs of up to 105.4 per cent that China placed on US poultry two months ago because of alleged dumping.The new tariffs come at a time when economic friction between the two countries appeared to be relaxing, after the US Treasury department delayed its decision over whether to label China a currency manipulator and signals from Beijing that it will abandon its dollar peg.It is a reminder of the number of thorny bilateral trade issues between the two countries, following the Obama administration’s decision to levy tariffs on Chinese tyres in September.The decision all but closes off what had become a lucrative side-business for the US poultry industry after China became its biggest export market, with sales of $722m in 2008. Chinese consumers favour chicken wings and feet, parts of the bird that are usually shunned in the US, which means they can fetch prices 20 times higher in the Chinese market.Although there have been complaints from Chinese companies for several years about surging US chicken imports, Beijing announced it would investigate US poultry imports two days after the US decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports of tyres. It was angered by the tyre duties because they used the safeguard provisions under China’s World Trade Organisation accession agreement which can be invoked if there is a surge in imports from China.This is the first time China has imposed duties on imports of agricultural goods on the grounds of alleged subsidies. Similar duties were placed on some US specialist steel products last year. The commerce ministry did not say how it had calculated the level of subsidies received by US farmers, although it said they were the result of the subsidised corn and soyabeans used in chicken feed.Under the new ruling, US companies that submitted information to the Chinese government investigation, such as Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods, would face duties of 3.8 per cent to 11.2 per cent, while companies which did not co-operate would face duties of 31.4 per cent.Earlier this year Beijing threatened to impose sanctions on a number of leading US companies for participating in a planned arms deal with Taiwan. There have also been trade disputes between China and either the US or the European Union over aluminium, chemicals, nylon and auto parts.However, despite dire predictions that the global economic downturn would lead to a rash of trade disputes, business groups calculate that only 1-2 per cent of trade with China is affected by ongoing trade cases.
97;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-02-18T19:10:40Z;Call for tax on livestock emissions;;Livestock should be taxed to reduce the contribution made by their flatulence to greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations said on Thursday in a report that will give fresh ammunition to campaigners against the preponderance of meat in the foodchain.The novel suggestion by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation to use taxation comes as campaigners focus on the impact on climate change of emissions of methane from cattle, sheep and pigs.“Market-based policies, such as taxes and fees for natural resource use, should cause [livestock] producers to internalise the costs of environmental damages,” the FAO said in its annual report, The State of Food and Agriculture.“The sector is consuming a large share of the world’s resources and is contributing a significant portion of global greenhouse gases emissions,” the report adds.The proposal, if supported by governments, could hit companies such as JBS of Brazil, the world’s largest meat producer, and large US-based businesses such as Tyson Foods, Cargill or Smithfield. Governments do not necessarily follow the FAO’s recommendations, but its views carry some weight, particularly among European policymakers.The FAO said that without fresh measures – from taxes and fees to cuts in subsidies or a boost in the efficiency of the sector – “continued growth in livestock production will otherwise exert enormous pressures on ecosystems, biodiversity, land and forest resources and water quality, and will contribute to global warming”.Carl Atkin, of UK-based consultancy Bidwells Agribusiness, said that investment in “research and development and technological innovation” could reduce the sector’s environmental footprint more effectively than taxation.Although the FAO is far from advocating a vegetarian diet as some campaigners do – it said livestock is critical for human nutrition – its call for reform will bolster groups seeking to tax the livestock sector.Farming groups and meat industry associations have vigorously opposed the introduction of livestock taxes.The sector has suffered in the past two years from high feeding costs due to soyabean and corn rising in value combined with a drop in demand.The FAO’s call for reform of the livestock industry comes amid a surge in global meat consumption.The meat boom is the result of countries such as China adopting a western diet richer in meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. Meat consumption per capita in China has jumped to 59.5 kilograms per year, up more than threefold from 13.7kg in 1980. In Brazil, it has doubled to 80.8 kg.The world’s per capita meat consumption has increased to 41.2 kg per year, up 37 per cent from 30 kg in 1980. Demand has also jumped for milk and eggs.Jacques Diouf, FAO director-general, said the rapid growth of the livestock sector over the last three decades has “been taking place in an institutional void”.
98;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-02-05T22:29:41Z;Wall St volatile after mixed US jobs report;;US stocks see-sawed on Friday after a mixed monthly jobs report created further uncertainty about the pace of the economic recovery.While the unemployment rate fell to a five-month low, the labour department also reported a surprise decline in January payrolls.Futures initially turned positive on the data but the market continued to fluctuate.After dropping 1.8 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 staged a dramatic last-minute recovery, closing 0.3 per cent higher at 1,066.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 10,012.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,141.12.On Thursday, Wall Street suffered its worst daily losses since April last year after fears over European sovereign debt and disappointing weekly unemployment data unnerved investors.The Vix index, which tracks market volatility through option prices and is known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped more than 20 per cent on Thursday and edged very slightly higher on Friday.Over the course of the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, the Dow lost 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq was 0.3 per cent lower. The benchmark index has fallen 4.4 per cent since the start of the year.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said he believed the market was facing a correction of at least 10 per cent as the earnings season continues to weigh on investors’ confidence. “As people have come to accept the idea that we’re in recovery, their expectations have risen.“There’s been a tendency when companies have reported – unless they’ve shown not only good solid earnings progress but improved revenues or business fundamentals – for investors to be disappointed.“Expectations may be a little high here relative to the economy and what companies are able to deliver. And because the market has run up so much, this is pushing us into a general correction.”Tyson Foods helped lift the market higher, rising 4.7 per cent to $14.65 after the company swung to a first-quarter profit.The results were also better than had been expected, thanks in part to lower grain costs for its chickens.Simon Property Group, the country’s largest owner of shopping malls, posted a sharp decline in quarterly profit due to writedowns and lower occupancy rates.However, the results were also better than expected, helping to lift its shares 5.6 per cent to $73.36.American Axle & Manufacturing, an auto parts supplier, initially rose after cost cuts enabled the company to post a quarterly profit. The group, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy in September, gave an optimistic forecast for this year. However, the shares were later down 10.6 per cent to $8.42.Airgas showed one of the market’s steepest gains, surging 40 per cent to $60.96.Air Products and Chemicals, Airgas’s rival, launched an unsolicited $5.1bn cash bid for the company in an effort to become the country’s largest industrial gas group.Meanwhile, shares in Air Products fell 6.9 per cent to $68.64.Aetna posted a lower quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting due to higher costs at its disability business.However, after early weakness, its shares were up 1.3 per cent at $29.61.In the retail sector, Coach lost 0.4 per cent to $34.32 after Goldman Sachs cut the country’s largest maker of luxury leather handbags to “neutral” from “buy”.Retailers were in focus earlier this week as companies posted their January sales figures.The 29 retailers that posted their monthly revenues recorded an average sales rise of 3.3 per cent after analysts had been expecting a 2.5 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.
99;TSN;Tyson Foods;2010-01-14T18:58:48Z;US stocks struggle following retail data;;"US stocks struggled to push higher on Thursday after an unexpected drop in retail sales gave investors reason for caution.The benchmark index has closed higher in seven out of eight sessions so far this year, lingering around a 15-month high.But after dipping in and out of the red on Thursday, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,145.47 by midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,690.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was also 0.1 per cent higher at 2,310.58.The market had opened lower after the latest commerce department figures showed retail sales, excluding cars, had fallen 0.2 per cent in December. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.3 per cent.“The data sets came in a little bit on the soft side but didn’t necessarily take us into panic territory,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global.He added that uncertainty about demand for the government’s rush of Treasury auctions this week was also making the market nervous. Investors have speculated that the surprising demand for notes in the past few days has been fuelled by one big mystery bidder, whose intentions are still unclear.The disappointing retail data weighed on the market and also overshadowed positive corporate results from the sector itself.Target resumed its share buy-back plan following an improvement to the discount chain’s cash flow.In November 2008, the group halted further purchases halfway through the $10bn plan because of concerns over liquidity.However, revenue growth from its retail and credit card operations left Target confident that it could complete the buy-backs within three years. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $49.75.Encouraging sales in the holiday period prompted Williams-Sonoma to give a higher forecast for the fourth quarter than analysts had expected. But shares in the upmarket home goods retailer still fell 3.3 per cent to $21.99.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, announced that it was buying 25 Snyder’s drug stores but its shares were flat at $37.06.Tyson Foods helped to lift the market after analysts at Credit Suisse raised the world’s largest meat processor to “outperform” from “neutral”.“While we clearly missed the bottom on Tyson stock, it is still under-owned, unloved and in the early stages of a cyclical rebound in protein processing,” wrote analyst Robert Mos­kow. Tyson’s shares showed the largest gains on the S&P 500, rising 4.4 per cent to $13.90.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Cryolife, which distributes human tissue for transplants, bought a stake in Medafor and became the largest single shareholder of the group. The company said it hoped to acquire the remainder of Medafor’s common stock. Cryolife gained 1.1 per cent to $6.68.The technology sector also helped to lift the market higher from the opening bell. Oracle gained 2.1 per cent to $25.27 after Morgan Stanley increased its price target on the stock to $31 from $29, citing the benefits of its imminent acquisition of Sun Microsystems.An analyst at UBS said the software maker could halve the number of Sun employees when it finally closed the deal. The $7bn takeover has been under scrutiny for months as a result of concerns about competition.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, came under renewed scrutiny from the Department of Justice. The government requested more information on the company’s soyabean business following complaints that farmers had been forced to pay for
more expensive products. Monsanto’s shares lost 1.2 per cent to $82.91.Financial stocks were in focus as details emerged about the government’s $90bn levy on the sector. Bank of America was up 0.4 per cent to $16.69, while Morgan Stanley lost 2.2 per cent to $30.56.LaBranche surged some 44.2 per cent to $4.01 after Barclays announced that it had bought the company’s designated market-maker business for $25m in cash.The S&P 500 financial sector, which had helped to lead the market higher in early trading, was flat by midday."

The shares were up 2.8 per cent to $10.66 on Monday.Renewed deal activity in the consumer sector also boosted sentiment on Wall Street. The bidding war for Cadbury intensified over the weekend as expectations grew that the chocolate maker, which is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods, would receive a counterbid from Hershey.Nestlé was also reported to be weighing up its options for the British company. While Cadbury shares gained in London, Hershey dropped 1.3 per cent to $36.39 and Kraft was up 0.6 per cent to $27.34.Shares in Diedrich Coffee jumped 29.5 per cent to $33.65 after Peetâ€™s Coffee & Tea, the gourmet coffee chain, raised its offer for the company to $32 per share.Green Mountain Coffee also confirmed its $30 a share offer for the company.Peet’s Coffee was down 13 per cent to $33.06 while Green’s shares were up 0.6 per cent to $65.44.The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent higher at 1,106.24 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4 per cent to 2,176.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since October last year, rising 1.3 per cent to 10,450.95.Stocks fell last week after a rush of disappointing economic data left investors nervous about the pace of the economic recovery.Renewed dollar strength had also hit commodity stocks. However, the rising oil price on Monday helped to lift the S&P energy sector 1.6 per cent.Richard Sparks, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “The week after options expiration, which is the week that we’re now in, is traditionally weak but the selling that we experienced last week has created an environment where people don’t want to miss the next move up.”He also said the low volumes that have characterised the rally over the past two weeks could be setting stocks up for further gains.“It gives the potential for the rally to continue because most of the time the market doesn’t top out on slow, measured buying. It is the high-volume euphoria that creates market tops.”Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor, posted better than expected quarterly results but its shares were down 1.5 per cent to $12.88.A writedown on its beef business meant that the group swung to a net loss but total revenues grew due to strong demand for pork, beef and chicken.Campbell Soup’s quarterly profit also beat analysts’ estimates after the company benefited from the lower cost of tomatoes, grain and tin.Campbell has experienced high demand for its soups and pasta sauces over the past year as more shoppers cook at home to save money. Its shares were 1.4 per cent higher at $34.60.In other deal news, Odyssey Marine Exploration, which specialises in recovering goods from shipwrecks, announced that it had bought a minority stake in SMM Project.SMM owns the mineral rights to 60,000 sq m of the South Pacific ocean floor and Odyssey’s acquisition will allow it to branch out into the exploration of gold and copper. Odyssey shares rose 3.9 per cent to $1.59.People’s United Financial, the holding group for People’s United Bank, said it would buy Financial Federalfor about $738m in an effort to boost its equipment financing businesses. Financial Federal soared 29.5 per cent to $26.61 while People’s was down 2.7 per cent to $16.03.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for the sixth session in a row, gaining 0.4 per cent to 10,291.26. The Nasdaq rose 0.7 per cent to 2,166.90.“We’re seeing more productivity overseas but the main thing that’s driving the market today is the Fed,” said Doug Roberts of Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They indicated that they’re going to keep rates fairly low and that’s what people are looking for. The government is the lender of last resort and as long as the stimulus programmes continue then there’s plenty of liquidity. A weaker dollar is also fuelling the whole market.”Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, surprised the market by announcing that fourth-quarter revenues would only drop 30 per cent and would come in more than $100m above analysts’ estimates. The Pennsylvania-based builder also said that net contracts for the quarter had risen 42 per cent, raising hopes that the housing market is beginning to stabilise. Shares in the group climbed 16.4 per cent to $21.41.Shares of United Parcel Service, the world’s largest package delivery service, gained 2.2 per cent to $58.07 after its chief executive, Scott Davis, told Reuters that he expected volume to grow next year and would also increase shipping rates. Last week, the group said that it was looking to emerging markets and the healthcare sector for acquisitions in order to bolster its supply-chain and freight-forwarding units.On Tuesday, FedEx, the second-largest player in the market, also forecast a rise in shipments in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers spend more money and business deliveries begin to pick up. FedEx shares were up 0.5 per cent at $82.50, leaving them 7 per cent higher this week.Oshkosh, the speciality vehicle manufacturer, said that it had received a $438m order for an additional 1,000 blast-proof trucks from the US military, sending its shares up 3.2 per cent to $40.25. The trucks are designed for use in Afghanistan, where the military can’t use the vehicles it normally deploys in Iraq because of the poor quality of the roads.Microchip Technologies gave a boost to the Nasdaq after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” and removed it from its sell list, saying the company was beginning to address gaps in its portfolio. The shares were up 1.9 per cent at $26.71.However, shares in Nucryst Pharmaceuticals surged the most on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising 70 per cent to $1.70 after Smith & Nephew, a medical technology company, agreed to buy the drugmaker’s assets for about $21m.The wider market also managed to shrug off a series of disappointing corporate results on Wednesday.Macy’s fell 8.1 per cent at $17.86 after the department store chain reported a third-quarter loss and gave a full-year profit forecast below expectations. However, its net loss narrowed to $35m from $44m a year earlier due to stronger sales at it Bloomingdale’s stores and online.Shares in Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat producer, slipped 1.1 per cent to $13.04 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” due to increased corn and hog prices and pressure from rivals.Simmons First National, the financial holding company, priced its public offering of 2.65m common shares at a discount to their closing price on Tuesday. Shares in the Arkansas-based group fell 4.2 per cent to $24.52
102;TSN;Tyson Foods;2009-09-14T20:56:34Z;Utility stocks help Wall Street recover;;Utility stocks helped Wall Street recover from early losses on Monday after investors feared a trade dispute between the US and China would spark a pull-back.Shares in AES, the power company, rose 4.5 per cent to $14.79 after reports that China’s sovereign wealth fund was eyeing a stake in the group. The S&P utility index gained 1.6 per cent, helping to reassure investors even after a row erupted between the two countries.Late on Friday US President Barack Obama had said he would impose a duty of 35 per cent on Chinese tyre imports. Beijing accused Washington of “rampant protectionism”, saying it would investigate imports of US poultry and vehicles.Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the biggest US tyremaker, climbed 3 per cent to $17.78. The Ohio company has been badly hit by the recession and cut 5,000 jobs in February after axing 4,000 staff in the second half of last year. Cooper Tire & Rubber, which manufactures tyres mainly in the US but also in China, rose 7.1 per cent to $15.60.Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, fell 2.3 per cent to $5, while Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat processor, fell 2.4 per cent to $12.45.Mr Obama’s speech on regulatory reform on Monday had little immediate effect on the market and stocks continued to fluctuate until rallying late in the day.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,049.34, while the technology-focused Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent to 2,091.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 9,626.80, powered by a 4.6 per cent gain in General Electric after the shares broke through the $15 milestone to $15.35.“People are taking a little bit of protection but they’re not willing to give up on the market yet,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Canaccord Adams. He said the market had declined in early trading because investors were taking money off the table after last week’s rally and guarding themselves in response to the trade dispute with China.“Markets have been overbought and they’re due for a pull-back at some point, it’s just a question of when that is,” he said.Financial stocks led the market lower in early trading. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning US economist, had added to concerns about the economy when he said in an interview on Sunday that underlying problems still lingered in the the US banking system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.After early losses, Bank of America crept up 0.1 per cent to $16.99, while Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $4.52. MB Financial, which operates mainly in the Chicago area, rose 5.5 per cent to $17.97 after it announced a $150m share offering.Materials stocks also helped the market. Sealed Air, the bubble-wrap maker, added 5.9 per cent to $20.16 after its biggest intraday gain since May on an upgrade from BofA.The brokerage raised its rating on Avery Dennison, the world’s largest label maker, helping boost the shares 6 per cent to $34.55.Sprint Nextel, after soaring 20 per cent, was up 10.1 per cent to $4.15 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the mobile operator.At the weekend, Cadbury reiterated its stance on the takeover bid from Kraft Foods, saying Kraft’s low-growth business model was an “unappealing prospect”.BofA analysts later issued a note saying the British confectioner was unlikely to receive a competing bid. Kraft closed flat at $26.11.Falling commodity prices had initially hit the market but following the afternoon rally ExxonMobil was unchanged at $70. ConocoPhillips gained 1.4 per cent to $46.59 even though oil remained below the $70 level.Following a good performance last week on the back of rising metal prices, Alcoa was unchanged at $12.94. A downgrade from HSBC had initially pushed the stock lower.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Alexza Pharmaceuticals fell 11.7 per cent to $2.56 after it reported disappointing results from the trial of its migraine drug.Salix Pharmaceuticals soared 51.1 per cent to $20.22 after it said Rifaximin, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, had met the goals of its latest trials.
103;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Tyson returns to profitability;;Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat producer, surprised investors on Monday by announcing quarterly results far ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, returning to profitability even as American consumers continue to trim their food-buying habits.However, the company cautioned that US demand for meat had not bounced back, and warned that the next three months were likely to be more difficult.The results were nevertheless extremely welcome for a company that has had a highly challenging year. Before the economic downturn started to affect shoppers’ behaviour, Tyson was squeezed by high grain prices, which dragged its chicken unit - and the whole group - into the red. Its derivatives trading unit made bad bets that resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.Critics said Tyson was slow to cut production as the economy deteriorated, leading to overproduction that spurred a sharp fall in chicken prices. Those criticisms led to the ousting of Dick Bond, former chief executive, in January.Tyson made net profits of $127m or 33 cents per share, excluding extraordinary items, in its fiscal third quarter to June 28 – up from a loss of 43m or 1 cent per share in the same period last year and well ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 20 cents per share. Its revenues were $6.7bn, in line with expectations.“Soft demand for protein is likely to make the fourth quarter more challenging than the third quarter, but I’m feeling much better about our position than I would be if we were sitting on a lot of inventory,” said Leland Tollett, interim president and chief executive.Tyson’s chicken unit performed well, selling 5 per cent more volume at prices that were 2 per cent higher than the same period last year. By contrast, prices in the company’s beef and pork divisions both fell by more than 10 per cent from last year.Mr Tollett said he was “encouraged by our progress in improving operational efficiencies in the chicken segment, although we still have work to do.”Farha Aslam, an analyst at Stephens, the investment bank, wrote in a research note published before the results that she was anticipating “excellent results in the poultry business as the company’s higher cost grain largely ran through the P&L in the second quarter and chicken pricing improved significantly in the third quarter.”As well as the downturn, pork sales have also been hit by the outbreak of the swine flu virus, which has prompted some countries to ban US pork exports, even though the flu is not spread by hogs or meat. Because of oversupply in the pork market, Tyson is aiming to cut its hog breeding herd by 28 per cent.
104;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Brazil’s Perdigão and Sadia announce tie-up;;Perdigão and Sadia, Brazil’s two biggest producers of processed meats and other foods, have announced a deal to form a new company with annual sales of R$22bn ($10.6bn).The combined company, which will export about 42 per cent of its production, will create the world’s biggest poultry company by market value, overtaking Tyson Foods of the US.The deal marks the latest in a series of deals to create Brazilian multinationals capable of competing for a leading position on global markets.Sadia tried to buy Perdigão in a hostile takeover rejected by Perdigão’s shareholders in 2006. Since then Perdigão has outgrown its formerly bigger rival and last year Sadia made the first loss in its history after bets on the continued appreciation of Brazil’s currency went badly wrong following the onset of the global economic crisis. Sadia lost some R$2.3bn in the transactions, forcing it to seek capital from outside investors. When no investor emerged, the company agreed to discuss a merger with Perdigão.Under the latest deal, a new holding company called HFF will be created by holders of at least 51 per cent of shares in Sadia, while Perdigão will change its name to Brasil Foods, or BRF. Sadia’s shareholders will then receive 0.166247 shares in BRF in exchange for each share in HFF.The deal is subject to approval of authorities in Brazil and other countries.The combined company will have 116,000 employees, production facilities in 10 of Brazil’s 27 states as well as in the UK, the Netherlands, Romania and Russia, and sales offices in 17 countries in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.Brazil is the world’s biggest exporter of chicken. The new company’s outlook will be boosted by an agreement signed on Tuesday between China and Brazil, removing sanitary restrictions on Chinese imports of Brazilian chicken that have been under negotiation since 2004.Last year Itaú and Unibanco teamed up to create the biggest bank in Brazil, while Oi (formerly Telemar) and Brasil Telecom agreed to merge to create Brazil’s biggest telecoms company.Earlier this month, shares in JBS and Mafrig, two of Brazil’s biggest meatpackers, jumped on speculation that they could also be preparing to merge.
105;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tyson Foods;;"Intrepid carnivores are about the only ones who rejoice when scares like mad cow disease, avian influenza and most recently swine flu throw supply and demand out of whack. The scientific merits of avoiding the meat in question vary from mild paranoia in the case of mad cow to utter nonsense with the recent scare.But the effect on farmers and meat processors is nasty all the same. Not surprisingly, industry leader Tyson Foods was a key proponent of renaming the scourge with the less catchy title “Influenza A virus subtype H1N1”, but that horse, or in this case pig, has already bolted.Tyson is big – it makes enough hot dogs annually to circle the earth and could cover Manhattan twice over with its pepperoni slices. But there is more than meets the eye to Tyson’s swine flu exposure and overall outlook.The initial swine flu coverage last week knocked nearly 9 per cent off Tyson’s shares. Prices recovered somewhat and then bounced over 10 per cent on Monday after the company released quarterly earnings.They were just a penny above forecasts, but an improved outlook for chicken encouraged investors. A third of Tyson’s sales, chicken processing has been an awful business that recently sent the industry leader, Pilgrim’s Pride, into bankruptcy. There is now light at the end of the tunnel, with margins stabilising.Pork, meanwhile, is just 13 per cent of Tyson’s sales. Unlike with poultry, Tyson has a “spread strategy”, eschewing vertical integration and acting as middleman. Analysts at Barclay’s Capital still see some reverberations as countries like China and Russia impose import bans, producing a knock-on effect on US protein prices. But the downside is limited and appears milder than for pork-heavy rival Smithfield Foods. Tyson is feeling poorly too, but should soon recuperate enough to bring home the bacon.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

106;TSN;Tyson Foods;2009-05-04T22:01:28Z;Tyson turns corner after turbulent year;;Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat producer, suggested on Monday that it had turned a corner, saying its businesses could return to normal operating margins by the next quarter and that it was cutting back on its lossmaking derivatives trading operations.The company has had a turbulent year. Before the global downturn hit consumers’ food-buying habits, Tyson was squeezed by high grain prices, which dragged its chicken unit – and the whole company – into the red.Critics said Tyson was slow to cut production as the economy deteriorated, leading to overproduction that spurred a sharp fall in chicken prices. Those criticisms led to the ousting of Dick Bond, former chief executive, in January.Leland Tollett, Tyson’s interim president and chief executive, was keen to draw a line under Mr Bond’s departure. “As of today we’re making money on all of our businesses,” he said.“Our chicken segment has been profitable since the end of February and I am pleased with the consistent progress we are making,” Mr Tollett said. “It really feels good to be making money in our chicken segment again. We may not be exactly where we want to be but we’re on the right track.”Donnie Smith, senior group vice-president of poultry and prepared foods, said the company would get margins in its chicken business back to normalised levels either in its current fiscal third quarter to the end of June or in the next quarter. “We’re not too sure we’ll get into that range in Q3. We like our chances in Q4 …we feel cautiously optimistic about our chicken business.”Their remarks came as Tyson said it made a much bigger loss in the three months to March 28 than last year. The company made a loss of $104m or 28 cents per share in the quarter, down from a loss of $5m or 2 cents per share a year earlier.Tyson’s risk-management division performed poorly, with its derivatives-trading unit losing $63m in grain and energy contracts, compared to a profit of $43m in the same period last year. The company was also hit by charges for restructurings related to plant closings and tax expenses.After losing $251m in grain and energy derivative trading in the last two quarters – compared to a profit of $70m in the prior year – Tyson signalled it was now withdrawing from the markets.“The overwhelming majority of the hedging losses are now behind us and because we now have more short-term contracts with customers, we don’t need to take as many large positions as we have in the past,” said Dennis Leatherby, chief financial officer.“This is the right approach and will reduce these big swings in hedging losses and gains.”The optimistic outlook pushed Tyson shares up 8.6 per cent to $11.47 by early afternoon in New York on Monday.
107;TSN;Tyson Foods;2009-04-27T21:38:33Z;Markets suffer side effects of outbreak;;World equity markets were rocked on Monday after the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico sparked fears of a global pandemic.Airline, travel and tourism stocks were the biggest fallers amid concerns that a flu pandemic could scupper hopes of economic recovery.It threatened to take the shine off the market’s seven-week rally, although the main indices recouped losses later in the day.The FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per cent, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 finished up 0.4 per cent and the S&P 500 closed up 1.01 per cent.The Mexican markets retreated sharply. The Mexican peso dropped 5.14 per cent against the US dollar, its steepest daily fall since November, at one point plumbing a three-week low.In contrast, rising risk aversion boosted the dollar, the yen and government bond prices as investors fled to the safest assets. Pharmaceuticals stocks were also boosted.The big fallers among airline, travel and tourism stocks included Germany’s Lufthansa, down 9.2 per cent, Air France-KLM Group, down 6.6 per cent, Marriott, the hotel chain, down 5.07 per cent, Expedia, the online travel agency, down 6.32 per cent, and Carnival, the cruise ship operator, down 13.51 per cent.US airline stocks suffered especially, with Delta Air Lines, the world’s biggest carrier, falling 14.34 per cent. American Airlines gave up 13.28 per cent and Continental Airlines fell 16.38 per cent, while United Airlines dropped by 14.33 per cent.“The last thing US airlines can withstand these days is another negative hit to demand,” Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, said during a conference call with clients.The deepening recession has already prompted many leisure and business travellers to postpone or cancel scheduled trips this year. Airlines have countered with sharp cuts to their flight schedules.Shares in Smithfield and Tyson, the leading US meat producers, both fell heavily on concerns their pork businesses would be affected.In contrast, pharmaceuticals stocks rose. Roche, which distributes Tamiflu, the frontline defence against the infection, gained 3.5 per cent, and Gilead, the US biotech company that developed the drug and gains a royalty on sales, rose 3.78 per cent.GlaxoSmithKline, which produces both Relenza, another antiviral drug, and flu vaccines, was up 7.57 per cent. AstraZeneca also rose 3.72 per cent, reflecting the relative defensiveness of pharmaceuticals at a time of uncertainty.Although governments on Monday called for calm and the World Health Organisation had held back during the day from advising people against travel, analysts predicted fear of a pandemic could set back any economic recovery.Sir David King, the UK’s former chief scientist and now chief scientific adviser to UBS, the Swiss bank, told investors in a conference call “the response of the population is often ahead of governments, with parents taking children out of school”.In a research note, ING warned that a pandemic would hurt second-quarter economic performance globally. “Markets should accept this is an additional risk factor in the immediate term that could undermine the nascent recovery in output,” it said.Reporting by Andrew Jack, David Oakley and Jenny Wiggins in London and Justin Baer and Jonathan Birchall in New York
108;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Tyson chief quits as troubles mount;;The head of Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat producer, resigned on Monday, underlining how the global economic downturn is squeezing the industry between softening demand and oversupply.Dick Bond said that after two-and-a-half years as president and chief executive of Tyson, he had decided “it is in both my best interest personally, and the best interest of the company, for me to move on”.He became the second high-profile meat industry chief to resign recently after Clinton Rivers, president and chief executive of Pilgrim’s Pride, the US’s biggest chicken producer, stepped down last month.Mr Rivers resigned under pressure from his board following the company’s filing for bankruptcy protection.Mr Bond’s departure comes at a challenging time for the meat sector, which faced high feed costs in the first half of last year when commodity prices were at record levels, only to be hit by weakening demand as the economy slowed.Tyson estimates that its grain costs for 2008 were $600m higher than the previous year.Mr Bond had also come under pressure from investors over the company’s strategy.Critics said Tyson, which is based in Springdale, Arkansas, had been slow to cut production as the economy deteriorated, leading to overproduction that has spurred a sharp fall in chicken prices.The company had been depending on international sales – which account for about 13 per cent of the company’s revenues – to lift performance, but that strategy was hit by the global economic downturn.Mr Bond took a 20 per cent pay cut last year, earning total compensation of $7.9m, and had cancelled merit pay rises for himself and other top executives for 2009.He warned in November that Tyson would probably “lose some significant dollars” in the first quarter of this year, largely because of its lossmaking chicken division.In the three months to late September, the company’s chicken business posted a $91m loss. Although that was more than offset by profits in other divisions, Mr Bond warned that the poor performance of its chicken unit could drag the company’s entire performance into the red.Moody’s downgraded the company shortly after that profit warning, cutting its rating from Ba1 to Ba3 and saying its outlook for the meat producer was negative.The company said Leland Tollett, its chairman and chief executive from 1995 to 1998, would take over from Mr Bond on an interim basis.It also announced a shake-up of its chicken division, with Donnie Smith, a veteran Tyson executive, assuming overall responsibility for poultry and prepared foods.Last month the company struck a deal with its lenders that gave it more flexibility on the covenants attached to a $1bn revolving loan in exchange for securing the debt with “substantially all” of its assets.Shares in Tyson were down 8.9 per cent at $8.51 by midday trading in New York on Monday.
109;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-10-21T19:18:46Z;Biofuels: From hope to husk;;"It was an American dream that has failed to become a reality. For much of the last decade, enthusiasts from President George W. Bush down have touted corn-based ethanol as something approaching a superfuel, a home-grown alternative to foreign oil that would help cut smog and bring hope to struggling farmers.It has not worked out that way. Instead, the ethanol industry has undergone a great boom and bust in which a Financial Times analysis has found investors as savvy as Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, have collectively lost billions of dollars.Despite the billions more in taxpayers’ dollars that was spent to subsidise it, ethanol now eats up nearly one-quarter of the US corn crop without so far fulfilling the hopes held for its beneficial effect either on the environment or US dependence on foreign energy.It may have helped keep gasoline prices lower in the world’s wealthiest nation, but a growing band of influential critics say it has also contributed to higher food prices in the world’s poorest countries. So far, the only sure beneficiaries from the ethanol promise have been the investors clever enough to get into the industry early and the corn farmers who have enjoyed a lucrative new market for their grain.In short, the story of ethanol is a cautionary tale of the unintended and costly consequences that can arise when the interests of politicians and influential industries collide.Today, ethanol is a $32.5bn (£19.1bn, €24.6bn) a year business in the US. But for nearly three decades it was an obscure cottage industry run by farmers trying to scratch out a living in the corn belt in the country’s Midwest. Americans had been making bourbon, a drinkable form of ethanol, from corn for centuries. But ethanol got its start as a fuel around the time of the 1970s Arab oil embargo, when a handful of early adherents started to argue that it could lower dependence on energy imports as well as help farmers.Among these pioneers was a gangly, soft-spoken Minnesotan named Jeff Broin. In 1983, Mr Broin and his father set up an ethanol still on their farm, hoping to sell corn-based fuel to the few companies then operating that had begun blending ethanol into gasoline. Three years later, the Broins bought a disused ethanol plant in nearby South Dakota and went into commercial production. The younger Mr Broin, then just 22, could scarcely have imagined that the family company, known today as Poet, would become an ethanol powerhouse.“We were simply trying to add value to grain,” he says. “If someone had suggested that we would become the largest producer of ethanol in the world, we probably would have laughed at them.”Farmers such as the Broins had powerful allies in Washington. Chief among them was a coalition of 20 Democratic and Republican “corn state” senators including Tom Daschle, the former Democratic majority leader, and Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa. But the ethanol boosters had a powerful adversary in big oil companies, which saw ethanol as a potential rival and argued that government support would be just another farm-state giveaway.This argument resonated in the national capital during the 1980s and 1990s. President George H.W. Bush, for example, disparagingly referred to ethanol as “Daschle gas”.But the president’s son thought differently. Mr Grassley remembers taking the younger Mr Bush on a tour of Iowa’s cornfields during his first presidential campaign in 2000. “I was one-on-one with him with a couple of other people in a van and I spent two days talking to him about ethanol,” says Mr Grassley. Mr Bush appeared to be impressed, Mr Grassley recalls. “He said, ‘It’s this simple. We’ve only got so much petroleum and we’ve got to have renewables. It’s got to be ethanol.’”Not long after Mr Bush took office in 2001, the September 11 terrorist attacks gave grim weight to the ethanol lobby’s arguments. “Isn’t it more sensible to spend $140 a barrel for ethanol than it is to ship $140 over to Arabia and let their Wahabis be trained to kill you and me?” asks Mr Grassley.The economics of ethanol were also shifting as rising oil prices made ethanol and other alternative fuels more attractive. On Wall Street, clever investors began to take notice. In May 2003, Morgan Stanley Capital Partners, the private equity arm of the US investment bank, bought Aventine Renewable Energy, an ethanol producer with plants in Illinois and Indiana, for $75m. It paid itself nearly twice that in dividends only seven months later.In 2004, lawmakers on Capitol Hill passed a law giving refiners an incentive to blend ethanol with gasoline by letting them claim a 51 cent per gallon tax benefit on each gallon of ethanol they used. By the following year, the politicians were under pressure to go even further. The price of a gallon of petrol had jumped over the $3 mark. Global warming worries were adding weight to the ethanol industry’s claims that the fuel was an important source of renewable energy. Legislators began work on a law for a renewable fuel standard that would require gasoline producers to blend billions of gallons of ethanol into petrol each year.Barack Obama, as a freshman Democratic senator from Illinois, a leading corn-producing state, was a big supporter. “If a terrorist hijacked a plane in Kuwait and crashed it into an oil complex in Saudi Arabia, it could take enough oil off the market and cause more economic damage in the United States than if a dirty nuclear weapon exploded in downtown Manhattan,” he said in a Senate speech. “Instead of continuing to link our energy policy to foreign fields of oil, it should be linked to farm fields of corn.”Not everyone agreed. New York’s Senator Chuck Schumer called the proposal a “boondoggle” and said: “There is no sound public policy reason for mandating the use of ethanol – other than the political might of the ethanol lobby.” Big users of corn, such as meat processor Tyson Foods, worried it would lead to higher corn prices.But ethanol supporters found an important, if unexpected, ally: their old rivals in the US oil industry. That was largely due to a fuel additive known as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), which helped petrol burn more fully and thus lower smog emissions. Oil refiners had been using the additive for years, especially since clean air requirements were enacted in the 1990s.By the early 2000s, however, MTBE had become a liability after scientists discovered that it lingered in ground water and polluted aquifers. California and other states banned it, leaving the oil industry searching for a substitute that would allow it to comply with environmental regulations and avoid billions of dollars in MTBE-related liabilities. Ethanol fitted the bill. “We saw ethanol as a viable product – it was a product that we knew,” says Al Mannato, fuels issues manager at the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s leading lobby group.The support of the API “significantly changed the political calculation on Capitol Hill”, says Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry grouping.This was a turning point. That summer, Congress passed, and Mr Bush signed, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which required refiners to blend 7.5bn gallons of biofuels into gasoline by 2012. Congress and the president created a multi-billion dollar market for corn-based ethanol virtually overnight. “Wall Street loved it,” says Kevin Book, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co, an investment bank. “Suddenly, wingtips were covered in corn dust in every state.”Speculators poured into the industry. In November 2005, an investment company owned by Microsoft’s Mr Gates struck a deal to pay $84m for a 27 per cent stake in Pacific Ethanol, a California group whose shares had begun trading on the Nasdaq stock market that year but had yet to produce a single drop of fuel.Not long afterwards, two New York hedge funds – Greenlight Capital, headed by David Einhorn, and Third Point, managed by Daniel Loeb – invested nearly $75m in BioFuel Energy, a Colorado ethanol producer. Thomas Edelman, a Wall Street banker and oil and gas executive, chipped in $8.75m and was appointed chairman.Ethanol futures prices shot up almost fourfold in the 12 months after the energy bill was signed. Meanwhile, the price of corn required to make a gallon of ethanol continued to languish thanks to surplus stores of the grain. The result was a bonanza for ethanol producers. Ethanol companies whose plants were up and running in time to catch this wave made fat profits for themselves and their investors.In 1999, there were 50 ethanol plants in the US. By January 2007, there were 110, with 76 more under construction. Most early ethanol plants probably paid for themselves within one or two years, according to Ray Goldberg, a professor of agribusiness at Harvard Business School.Ethanol’s potential as an oil alternative had also begun to take hold in the popular imagination. Advertisements appeared on billboards alongside highways in Missouri showed a Missouri farmer standing next to a cornfield. Opposite him was a picture of the late King Fahd, the former ruler of Saudi Arabia, dressed in traditional Arab robes. Between the two men, in large block letters, was a question: “Who would you rather buy your gas from?”The growing cost of ethanol production to US taxpayers went largely unnoticed, amid a hype that was reminiscent of the dotcom boom of a few years earlier. As several big ethanol producers announced plans to go public, ordinary investors, largely shut out from ethanol’s early years, jumped at the chance to buy into the industry.In May 2006, Thomas H. Lee Partners, a Boston private equity group, bought an 80 per cent stake in Hawkeye Renewables in a deal that valued the company at $1bn. THL almost immediately announced plans for an initial public offering. Morgan Stanley Capital Partners, which had been spun out of its parent bank and renamed Metalmark, reaped a tenfold return on its 2003 investment in Aventine Renewable Energy when Aventine became one of several biofuel producers to float on the New York Stock Exchange in June. The biggest star was VeraSun of South Dakota, whose shares immediately jumped 34 per cent on their debut.But the excitement proved to be short-lived. Investors had ignored some glaring warning signs. Few recognised it at the time, but the previous year’s boom had also set the stage for a shift in the economics of the industry that would prove disastrous for those who came late to the game. In the same month as VeraSun’s IPO, ethanol futures prices fell sharply, reversing the historical correlation between the price of ethanol and the price of a gallon of gasoline. By September, ethanol that had sold for $4 a gallon in June was trading at $1.75, according to DTN, a commodities research group.The problem was one of oversupply. Dozens of ethanol plants had come online trying to capitalise on the boom, creating a glut that pushed down prices. Corn prices, meanwhile, were rising sharply, driven by increased demand for the crop for use in ethanol production and the rising cost of oil. In the space of just three months, ethanol had moved from boom to bust.Some of the world’s best-known investors were burnt. When Mr Gates’ investment fund started disposing of its shares in Pacific Ethanol this April, it sold them at a steep loss. Deals such as the one Thomas H. Lee did with Iowa’s Hawkeye Renewables in 2006, which valued Hawkeye’s two ethanol plants at $1bn, began to look less wise. Some analysts say the plants could have been built for closer to $400m. When Colorado’s BioFuel Energy finally went public in June 2007, it was forced to cut its offer price twice in one week. It eventually raised $101m after expenses in a combined public offering and private placement.Even Mr Dinneen, the face of the ethanol industry in Washington, admits that, in hindsight, ethanol investors were suffering from “overblown exuberance”. “There was a period of growth in the industry, and the economics were uncharacteristically favourable,” he says. “People invested thinking every year was going to be like 2006, when history would tell you that was an anomaly. Clearly there was a lot of Wall Street money coming in – and I think it was with unrealistic expectations.”If ethanol were any other industry, it might be on its last legs today. But the dream of turning cornfields into car fuel refuses to die.ETHANOL INVESTORS: EARNINGS STREAM BECOMES A TRICKLELOSERS
Bill Gates:Best known of the investors to lose money in the ethanol frenzy. Cascade Investments, the Microsoft founder’s private investment company, paid $84m (£49m, €64m) for a 27 per cent stake in Pacific Ethanol in November 2005. The California company had a profitable business marketing ethanol made by other producers but had yet to produce a drop of the fuel itself.By the time its first plant came online in October 2006, plunging ethanol prices and the rising cost of corn had squeezed the industry. When Cascade began divesting its stake in April this year, Pacific shares sold for less than $4 – compared with $9 when it announced plans to invest and a $42 boom-time high. As of this summer, Mr Gates had lost at least $37.9m on the investment.Thomas H. Lee Partners:When the Boston private equity group took its 80 per cent stake in Hawkeye Renewables in May 2006 – a deal that valued the company at $1bn – a fundamental shift in the economics of ethanol was already under way. THL was forced to pull its planned flotation of Hawkeye in September that year and the company has yet to go public.WINNERS
Early investors:Those who got in to ethanol before the spike in prices in 2005-06 made fat returns. They include Don Endres (right) who in 2001 founded VeraSun Energy, a leading US producer whose hugely successful June 2006 IPO marked the peak of the ethanol boom.Farmers:Benefited from the surge in corn and land prices created in the boom. In addition, most ethanol plants are controlled by farmer-owned co-operatives. Those built before the end of 2005 are likely to have made a return. Associated industries such as tractor makers and seeds suppliers have also profited.Next: The end that never came"
110;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
111;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-09-26T19:52:03Z;Pilgrim’s Pride;;Up to 45m birds meet their maker each week at facilities run by Pilgrim’s Pride, the largest US chicken processor. Having grown from a single feed store 62 years ago, it relied on gutsy acquisitions to reach the top of the industry’s pecking order. Now it may become the latest victim of excessive leverage.The stock has cratered, down about 70 per cent over the week, with the losses accelerating on Thursday when Pilgrim’s disclosed it might breach its debt covenants. Some conditions had already been relaxed earlier this year and the company hopes for another waiver. With long-term borrowings of over $1.5bn and less than $285m in remaining market value, the banks may agree to see if commodity prices improve enough to save the business.In July 2007, shares in Pilgrim’s were at an all-time high as it digested rival Gold Kist, bought for about $1.2bn in January. The deal propelled it past rival Tyson Foods to become the country’s top poultry producer but came at a steep 55 per cent premium to Gold Kist’s market capitalisation. Barely three years before, the $600m purchase of Con Agra’s chicken business had made Pilgrim’s the number two producer.The added debt burden was followed by a commodity squeeze and Pilgrim’s compounded the problem through poorly timed hedging. Costs of its two main inputs, corn and soy meal, more than doubled over the year to this summer even as poultry prices were falling. Alas, the company locked in some costs shortly before crop prices started a steep reversal. For founder “Bo” Pilgrim, a rural Texan who rose from rags to riches, briefly seeing his family’s stake in the company worth over $1bn last year, it is a painful lesson. Having prospered through acquisitions, he made one that was too big at the wrong time.

112;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-09-26T00:38:36Z;Pilgrim’s Pride shares plummet by 40%;;Pilgrim’s Pride, the largest US chicken processor, saw its shares fall more than 40 per cent on Thursday after it warned that a larger-than-expected quarterly loss could put it in default on its debt.The company attributed the anticipated loss in its current fourth quarter to high feed-ingredient costs, and weak consumer demand and pricing for chicken breast meat, together with negative impact of hedged positions on its grain supply.As a result, it had told its creditors that it did not expect to be in compliance with its fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant when its fiscal year ends on Saturday.Its shares had already fallen more than 30 per cent on Wednesday on concerns about its financing arrangements.The company said on Thursday it was now seeking an agreement with creditor agents to waive the covenant for an additional month, during which time it would still have access to funding under the loans.Pilgrim’s Pride is based in Texas, and employs 53,000 people at more than 40 packing plants and distribution centres across the US. It has revenues of more than $8.5bn.The company overtook Tyson Foods to become the largest chicken producer in the US last year, when it acquired Gold Kist, a smaller rival, in a $1.1bn deal that led to its long-term debt increasing to $1.5bn.Along with its rivals, it has struggled with high feed costs, estimating that this year it would face an additional $900m in costs. Demand for more expensive chicken breast has also been hit as increasingly frugal Americans opt for cheaper meal alternatives.Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies lowered their ratings on the company’s bonds, with Moody’s saying it “is concerned that the current credit environment could make the timely resolution of a permanent waiver or amendment challenging”.The company renegotiated terms on its debt covenants in April saying they had been adjusted to levels it would be able to comply with. It is likely to face an increasingly tough approach from its creditors in the current tight credit market.So far, the consumer goods and retail sectors have been largely unscathed by the most recent turmoil in the credit markets. But tightening credit conditions have seen banks tighten debt covenants and reduce some credit lines to highly-leveraged companies seen as more exposed to the slowdown in consumer demand.
113;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-08-05T21:22:07Z;Wall Street higher as oil prices drop;;"Wall Street stocks snapped a three-session losing streak on Tuesday as oil prices fell to three month lows and the Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold for a second straight meeting.The move by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee to keep its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent was widely anticipated.Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, said: “Everyone expected the Fed to do what it did the only question was how much dissent would there be? I think that the dissent was less than expected, the Fed did what it was supposed to and then oil came in and gave markets a boost.”The day began in positive fashion after some estimate-beating results from Procter & Gamble cheered investors.The consumer products group behind Head & Shoulders shampoo, said fourth-quarter profits had jumped 33 per cent to $3.02bn as it passed on rising input costs to customers and benefited from the weak dollar which boosted foreign revenues. Proctor & Gamble shares rose 3.3 per cent to $67.97.A drop in the oil price below $120 a barrel helped the equity market shrug
off news that services industries in the US shrank for a second straight month in July.The consumer discretionary sector was among the leading gainers, adding 4.5 per cent with retailers making particularly strong progress after some data showed strong year-on-year same store sales last week.Macy’s surged 8.9 per cent to $19.49 and Sears Holdings rose 10.6 per cent to $91.56.Industrials and consumer staples also made ground adding 3 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.FedEx added 6.8 per cent to $83.99 and General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.25 while Wal-Mart Stores rose 3.3 per cent to $60.34 and Tyson Foods gained 7.8 per cent to $16.16.Oil is now down nearly 20 per cent from its high on July 3. As oil has pulled back, energy stocks have suffered. On Monday, the S&P 500 energy sector dropped into bear market territory after declining more than 20 per cent from its record highs in May.But energy and material stocks made ground on Tuesday in spite of falling commodity prices.Refiners Tesoro and Sunoco rose 5.3 per cent to $41.89 and 4.1 per cent to $15.53, respectively, helping the energy sector to a 1.1 per cent gain.In materials, a rebound in metals stocks pushed the sector up 1.3 per cent. US Steel rose 2.4 per cent to $143.17, Allegheny Technologies added 4.8 per cent to $45.89 and Titanium Metals gained 7 per cent to $10.68.All 10 leading industry groups closed in positive territory helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 2.9 per cent to 1,284.88 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.9 per cent to 11,615.77 The Nasdaq Composite added 2.8 per cent to 2,349.83.On Monday, equity markets declined for a third straight session as a broad slide in commodity prices helped some stocks but hurt the heavily weighted energy and materials sectors.About 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have reported in this earning season
and, on average, profits have declined about 19 per cent.On Tuesday, investors were presented with a mixed set of earnings reports. In addition to results from P&G, DR Horton also reported earnings. The largest US homebuilder reported a fifth straight quarterly loss and the shares dipped 0.3 per cent to $11.19.Archer Daniels Midland, the grain processor, said fourth-quarter profit dipped 61 per cent missing analyst estimates. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $25.87.Tenet HealthCare also lost ground, losing 8.2 per cent to $5.72 after it reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss but the healthcare sector as a whole gained 2.6 per cent nonetheless.Financials regained some ground, adding 5.1 per cent as oil prices slipped back.Lehman Brothers surged 12.8 per cent to $20.24, Citigroup added 5.8 per cent to $19.92 while JP Morgan advanced 4.4 per cent to $41.89.AIG was among the leading gainers, adding 12 per cent to $29.89 after analysts at UBS recommended that investors buy shares in the insurer saying it was “well-positioned” to absorb losses from credit-related assets."
114;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-07-28T22:31:26Z;Wall St falls amid gloomy US housing forecasts;;"Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors digested mixed results, a rise in oil prices and a report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that the US housing crisis could continue for some time.The day began well after Kraft, the foodmaker, said that second-quarter profits rose from $707m last year to $732m because it passed on the rising costs of food and fuel to customers. Kraft rose 4.9 per cent to $30.83.The results helped the consumer staples sector advance, but only until chicken producer Tyson disappointed the market with its third-quarter results. It said profits fell 92 per cent to $9m, hit by the rising cost of food for poultry. Tyson shares dipped 7 per cent to $15.09.Verizon Communications’ second quarter results were better than expected but left investors uninspired. Verizon shares fell 2.5 per cent to $33.60 dragging the telecoms sector down 2.4 per cent.Financials made early gains after lawmakers voted in favour of a housing bill designed to support the mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and prevent foreclosures for about 400,000 homeowners.But enthusiasm for the sector wore off after the IMF said that financial markets remained “fragile” and warned that “a bottom for the housing market is not visible”. The IMF stood by its prediction that losses from US mortgage woes could total about $1,000bn.American International Group fell 12 per cent to $23.96, Citigroup 7.5 per cent to $17.89 and JPMorgan 4.7 per cent to $37.66. The S&P 500 financials index fell 2.3 per cent and an index of investment banking stocks fell 4 per cent.Merrill Lynch fell 11.6 per cent to $24.33. Over the past 10 days the brokerage has gained and lost about 30 per cent of its value.Consumer discretionary and industrials stocks fell back 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively on the news and the slide was reinforced by a small rise in the price of oil.General Motors and Ford fell 7.6 per cent to $11 and 5.9 per cent to $4.75 while General Electric dipped 3.6 per cent to $27.69. An index of homebuilder stocks slid 5.4 per cent.At the close, all 10 leading industry groups were in the red dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.9 per cent to 1,234.38 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent to 11,131.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 2 per cent to 2,264.22 points.Last week, stock markets fell as financial stocks came under pressure in a volatile period of trading, taking their cue from poor housing data, predictions of further credit-related losses and concerns that an earnings-induced rally was overdone.Second-quarter earnings season kicked into high gear last week and the news has been mixed. Of the 236 companies in the S&P 500 to have reported, earnings, on average, have dropped 23.3 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials have been the worst performers, posting a 92.3 per cent decline. Excluding the sector, profits rose 9.5 per cent.Brian Belski, sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted that investor reactions had been “volatile”, that many companies had offered below consensus guidance for the full year, but that pockets of strength were being overlooked.“Strength in actual technology earnings for the second quarter has been cast aside by increasing doubts surrounding forward guidance . . . [although] technology is by far the strongest sector in terms of exceeding forward guidance so far this year,” Mr Belski said.That continued as technology stocks slipped. Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $20.12, Apple lost 4.8 per cent to $154.40 and Google fell 3 per cent to $477.12. Earnings news should remain in the headlines this week as about a quarter of the S&P 500, including Disney, Motorola and Viacom, report.Amgen shares rose 12.2 per cent to $60.48 prior to its results after a study showed that its treatment for a bone-thinning disorder helped prevent fractures. A number of analysts also upgraded the stock. The news helped hold losses in the healthcare sector to 1 per cent.But Vanda Pharmaceuticals slid 70.2 per cent to $1 after regulators rejected the company’s Iloperidone schizophrenia drug. Vanda will halt development of the drug “pending further review” of the FDA’s rejection letter.Energy stocks were among the best performers, down only 0.5 per cent, as refiners suffered from the rise in oil prices. Tesoro fell 1.1 per cent to $15.30; Exxon Mobil slid 1.3 per cent to $80.68."
115;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-07-28T21:18:30Z;Melancholy Margins;;Kraft Food’s stellar results on Monday were enough to make other food processors wish they were Oscar Mayer weiners. The US maker of the famous hot dogs, Oreo cookies and Velveeta cheese said second-quarter profits rose 3.5 per cent due to strong sales and effective hedging of raw materials prices. Kraft said it has been able to push through price increases without driving away too many customers. Relieved investors pushed the share price up about 5 per cent.But Kraft’s ability to pass along rising costs may turn out to be unusual. On the same day, food processor Tyson Foods, which sells chicken and meat, said quarterly profits had fallen 92 per cent year-on-year because it had been unable to pass along all of its higher feed costs. Tyson’s share price tumbled about 7 per cent after it said grain costs for the full fiscal year will be $550m higher than in 2007.Other companies are also likely to be in for a margin squeeze, if history is any guide. Despite recent input price increases, the ratio of US corporate after-tax profits to gross domestic product remains near a 40-year high, according to Lehman Brothers. Slowing economic growth and continued high commodity prices mean that ratio is unsustainable. Merrill Lynch predicts 2009 operating margins will decline from 2008 levels across virtually all sectors, even energy and materials.Public companies are not alone in feeling the pain. Many recent buy-out targets are facing similar pressures and they have the additional burden of being weighed down with debt. So far, loose borrowing rules and exotic debt granted in the pre-credit crunch days have helped keep corporate default rates low. But rapidly falling operating margins could breach even the lightest of covenants. Even rolled-over obligations must be paid at some point, eroding equity returns. No lender or investor is going to be in love with that.
116;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Feed prices hit Tyson’s profits;;Profits at Tyson, one of the US’s biggest meat producers, were almost wiped out in the past quarter by the high cost of animal feed and unprofitable cattle price-hedging bets.The company warned that it was bracing itself to be hit even harder in the coming three months as consumer price rises lag behind increases in feed costs.Tyson and other food producers have struggled in the face of soaring grain and feed prices. Corn prices have hit record highs this year on strong demand from emerging economies and supply concerns because of flooding in the US’s Midwest corn belt.Corn accounts for more than a third of animal-rearing expenses. Across the board, US meat producers have either passed these increases on to consumers or are preparing to do so. Although Tyson has been raising meat prices, the increases have not completely offset the higher cost of grain.Tyson raises the chickens it processes into meat – unlike its beef and pork operations, which buy grown animals. The company said it paid $140m more for grain to feed its chickens during the three months ending June 28 than it did in the same period a year ago, and it expects grain costs to be up a total of $550m for its fiscal full year.The Arkansas-based company reported a profit for the quarter of $9m or 3 cents per share, down from $111m or 31 cents per share in the same period a year earlier and well below analysts’ expectations of about 12 cents per share. The figures belied an increase in overall sales, at $6.8bn for the quarter from $6.6bn last year.Tyson’s chicken division made a loss of $44m in the quarter, compared with a profit of $95m in the same period a year ago. Richard Bond, chief executive, struck a gloomy tone for the current quarter, saying the unit’s performance would probably continue to deteriorate.“Our chicken segment will not be positive in Q4 and its losses likely will be greater than Q3,” he warned. “Input costs, especially corn and soybean meal, are a serious concern.”The company’s beef unit, its largest division, earned $3m, down from $36m a year ago, largely because of $75m in losses on cattle hedging activity and forward beef sales. Mr Bond said that although the unit had performed well “results were masked by a negative $75m million impact from application of mark-to-market accounting treatment related to our unrealised derivative losses”. But he said he was confident that the company “will profit from this risk management activity over the coming months”.Tyson’s shares were down 5.1 per cent at $15.40 by ­midday trading on Monday in New York.
117;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US food groups plan hefty price rises;;US food companies are preparing another round of hefty price increases as soaring commodity costs force them to pass on rises to consumers.Sara Lee, maker of meat products such as Jimmy Dean sausages, said costs would compel it to push up prices on meat lines by up to a fifth later this year.“We will be taking price increases on the vast majority of the protein products in this calendar year,” said C.J. Fraleigh, Sara Lee’s chief operating officer for North America, in a recent interview.“Price increases vary a lot by type of products but the increases will be as low as zero and some products we will decrease on and other increases [will be] in excess of 20 per cent.” Kraft Foods, Kellogg’s, ConAgra and Tyson are also pushing through increases, which are expected to contribute to inflationary pressures in the US.US food prices have jumped 5.3 per cent for the year ending in June, the Department of Labor reported last week, adding to the pressures on Americans from rising unemployment, a slumping housing market and higher petrol prices.The increase in food prices was steep in June, when they moved up 0.8 per cent compared with 0.3 per cent in May.Crop prices have boomed in recent months on the back of strong demand from emerging economies and supply concerns following floods across the agricultural lands of the US Midwest.In June, meat prices surged to a 22-year high because of record costs for corn and soybean, food crops for livestock. The US Department of Agriculture expects pork production to fall 3 per cent in 2009, against a 1 per cent fall for chicken and beef.Bill Lapp of Advanced Economic Solutions, an agricultural consultancy in Omaha, said higher prices looked set to prompt the biggest decline in meat consumption for 27 years.“Consumers are expected to reduce their meat consumption next year by an average of nearly 5lbs per person,” he said. “That would be the biggest decline in meat consumption since 1982.”Kraft Foods, which has said it will push up its prices by 12-13 per cent this year, said some of its cheese categories could rise 25 per cent.Kellogg’s said last week that “dramatic” increases in grains and energy had forced it to push up prices by a few per cent.Additional reporting by James Politi in Washington
118;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-06-19T20:47:02Z;Wall St rebounds after drop in oil prices;;Wall Street stock markets rebounded on Thursday after a drop in oil prices buoyed consumer discretionary and transport stocks, taking the sting out of data showing continued weakness in the US economy and a warning from Citigroup about further writedowns.The day began in a downbeat fashion with new data that showed initial jobless claims dropped by less than expected last week, while manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in June.Still, it was the travails of the banking sector that weighed heaviest on equity markets in early trading. Comments from the chief financial officer of Citigroup accelerated losses.Gary Crittenden told investors that the largest US bank would have substantial writedowns on its holdings of subprime mortgage-related debt. Citigroup shares slid as much as 4.9 per cent before recovering to $20.17, down 1.3 per cent.As oil prices fell back however, a rally in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors picked up steam, and they advanced 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively erasing early losses.Amid the broad market rally, even financials ended the day in positive territory, adding 0.9 per cent alongside a 1.2 per cent gain for technology.By the close S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,342.83 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dipped below 12,000 points for the second successive day, before reviving. The index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 12,063.09 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,446.99 points.On Wednesday, equity markets sold off sharply, and the Dow hit a three-month low, after declines in the banking sector and a downbeat outlook on the economy from FedEx weighed on sentiment.The pattern initially repeated on Thursday after analysts cut their earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley, triggering a sell-off. Morgan Stanley shares, which struggled to a small gain on Wednesday, fell 1.2 per cent to $40.19.Regional banks have come under particular selling pressure in the past few days as a number of analysts have questioned the ability of smaller, less capitalised banks to stand up to the strains of the credit crisis and mounting losses on mortgage assets.But they also found some positive momentum on Thursday, adding to their gains after BB&T said that it would increase its dividend, dismissing an analyst’s prediction that the North Carolina bank would do just the opposite. BB&T overturned early losses to climb 0.1 per cent to $24.35, while Fifth Third recovered 5.3 per cent to $9.75.Industrials proved robust, as transport stocks helped them shake off the poor macroeconomic data.A number of rail companies have given warnings that flooding in the Midwest of the US will dent earnings, most recently Burlington Northern Santa Fe, but analysts and investors remain positive over the long-term outlook for the sector.Burlington shares added 2.3 per cent to $105.55 while peers Union Pacific and CSX climbed 2.6 per cent to $77.80 and 3.3 per cent to $66.34 respectively.In earnings news, Circuit City Stores, the electronics retailer that put itself up for sale last month, disappointed investors by reporting a loss of $164.8m and revenue down 7.4 per cent to $2.3bn. Circuit shares fell 1.7 per cent to $3.98.Better than expected second-quarter results from Carnival, the cruise line company, a rally in oversold stocks in the staples sector and a $5 drop in oil prices helped keep consumer-facing stocks well above water.Carnival rose 5.4 per cent to $36.84 and Tyson Foods added 5.8 per cent to $14.47.Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers, benefiting from tumbling oil prices, which may ease strains on global economic growth. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $28.93, Intel 2.6 per cent $22.85 and IBM 0.7 per cent to $125.02.Broadcom, the maker of chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, rose 7.6 per cent to $27.22 after analysts at Lehman Brothers said second-quarter earnings will get a boost off higher demand.Energy was the only sector to close in the red.ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $85.79 while ConocoPhillips fell 1.6 per cent to $93.66.
119;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
120;TSN;Tyson Foods;2008-04-28T19:06:56Z;Tyson results hit by hefty feed bill;;Tyson, the largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the US, on Monday reported its first loss in six quarters in part because it had not been able to pass the cost of feeding its birds on to consumers.Tyson suffered operating losses in its chicken business because of feed costs but also had trouble with expenses in its beef business, in part due to plant restructuring.For the quarter to the end of March, the company reported a loss of $5m, or 2 cents per share, compared with a $68m profit, or 19 cents per share, a year ago.The results included $47m, or 8 cents a share in charges, because of plant closings and asset impairments.Excluding charges, earnings would have been 6 cents per share, beating analysts’ expectations according to Reuters of a cent per share. Revenue in the quarter was $6.6bn, compared with $6.5bn a year earlier.Unlike in its beef and pork businesses where Tyson buys livestock from outside farmers, the company rears chickens itself and so is hit more by rising feed costs.The company said that the higher price of corn and soyabeans would add about $600m to costs this year in its chicken business, which made up about a third of sales this quarter.Cooking oil, breading and feed ingredients such as vitamins could be among factors adding a further $400m to costs. Last year, corn and soy costs doubled to $2bn.The company’s chicken business recorded an operating loss of $61m for the quarter as feed costs rose £102m.The company blamed the rising use of grains in biofuels for the inflation of costs and said that consumers had yet to feel the full weight of the price increases.“We can’t raise prices fast enough to keep up with the rising costs of our inputs,” said Richard Bond, chief executive.“Consumers are concerned the prices they are paying now but the cost we and other producers in all proteins are currently incurring are only beginning to be passed on to the consumer.”Tim Ramey, an analyst at DA Davidson, said that consumers had only seen about a 5-10 per cent increase in the cost of meat, but expects an increase of as much 100 per cent. “Consumers haven’t really seen much yet,” he said.Analysts said that Tyson’s outlook was better because of lower production helping to lift margins as well as South Korea dropping a ban on US beef imposed in 2003 after cases of mad-cow disease were discovered.
121;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-11-12T21:53:16Z;Tech stocks lead Wall St losses;;US equities were lower again on Monday as technology stocks suffered further selling pressure and as continuing credit market concerns helped extinguish a rally in financials.A measure of equity volatility closed at its highest level this year, indicating a big spike in fear over further large share price swings.An almost 60 per cent plunge at E-Trade Financial, tempered early confidence in the financial sector after an analyst said the online brokerage could go bankrupt.Large-cap technology companies declined amid worries about their growth prospects. Energy stocks were also sold as oil prices retreated.With fixed income markets closed for Veterans’ Day, equity trading volumes were reduced but the shallow liquidity contributed to the rise in volatility.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent lower at 1,439.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 13,000, closing 0.4 per cent lower at 12987.55.The major tech indices again fared poorly. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.7 per cent at 2,584.13 and has declined almost 10 per cent this month. The large cap Nasdaq 100 index declined 2.6 per cent at 1982.16.Financial and healthcare stocks outperformed, while energy and materials stocks were weakest.The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street’s fear barometer, jumped 9.1 per cent at 31.09, beating the year’s previous closing high set at the peak of the August credit squeeze.Major banks and brokerages rose early in the session after Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan simplified their plans for a$75bn superfund for distressed mortgage assets, which should allow it to sign up more banks.Citigroup closed 1.4 per cent higher at $33.57, while JPMorgan rose 0.2 per cent to $42.39. BoA was unchanged at $43.98.The S&P financial index rose as much as 2.8 per cent but closed only 0.2 per cent firmer at 406.91.“These stocks have been really crushed, so you are going to get some rallies off of that,” said Stephen Lauck, chief executive of Ashfield Capital Partners.E-Trade Financial reinforced concerns about the financial sector after Citigroup said bankruptcy risk could not be ruled out amid “a higher probability of a run on the bank”.E-Trade’s shares fell 58.7 per cent to $3.55. The online brokerage warned last week that it faced further mortgage-related writedowns.“The extent of poor risk management, in our view, has put the viability of the franchise at risk,’’ said Prashant Bhatia, a Citi analyst.E-Trade said that it remained well capitalised.Countrywide Financial’s warning that a reduction of its credit rating to junk would hamper its funding ability hit its shares on Monday. The stock shed 4.6 per cent at $13.19.In the technology sector, IBM rose after it agreed to buy Cognos, a Canadian business software company, for $5bn. IBM gained 1.2 per cent at $101.45.But other large cap technology companies continued to see selling pressure on fears about growth prospects in the sector.Microsoft fell 1 per cent at $33.38 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the company and lowered its view on the enterprise software sector.Technology stocks fell sharply last week after Cisco Systems’ chief executive warned of a “dramatic” decline in orders from financial companies.“Investors pick up on what, in a better market, would be a small negative and make it a bigger negative,” said Mr Lauck.Apple, down 7 per cent at $153.76, and Research in Motion, 9.4 per cent lower at $102.60, were among the worst performing tech stocks. EchoStar Communications fell 15.8 per cent to $40.83 after Citigroup downgraded the satellite television provider, citing elevated subscriber turnover.Intel launched a new generation of chips. Its shares jumped 0.6 per cent at $25.29.Tyson Foods fell 2.9 per cent to $14.33 after its 2008 earnings forecast missed expectations.Hershey rose 0.6 per cent to $41.29 after it announced a board shake-up.Energy and materials stocks fell as crude and other commodity prices fell.The S&P energy index lost 3.8 per cent to 545.46. Alcoa, down 3.3 per cent at $35.87, and ExxonMobil, 2.7 per cent weaker at $85.54, led falls on the Dow.
122;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wall Street stunned by jobs figures;;The recent resilience of US equities to strains in the money markets was tested on Friday by the news that the labour force had contracted for the first time in four years.Investors had expected a gain of 110,000 new jobs for August, but a loss of 4,000 sparked sharply lower stock prices. The report left investors contemplating whether the US economy could face a recession, rather than a period of below average growth.“The fear has changed to one of a recession,” said Scott Wren, equity strategist at AG Edwards. “We don’t see a recession, and to knock the economy off track will take a lot.”Before the arrival of the jobs report, the recent mood among equity investors had been one of cautious optimism. This was in spite of a persistent credit squeeze in the money markets. The commercial paper market has contracted 13.4 per cent in the past four weeks.Analysts had drawn a parallel with 1998, when a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts alleviated the last financial crisis and laid the ground for a boom in equities during 1999, led by the technology sector.“People were overly sanguine about prospects for the economy and continued to hope the problems in the subprime and housing sectors would remain contained,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. “Recession is the 64,000 dollar question and payrolls bode ill for consumer spending and corporate profits.”The latest payroll number means the average job gain for the past three months has been 44,000, well below the average of 147,000 between January and May. Sharp declines in construction and manufacturing payrolls indicates the housing recession is infecting the broader economy, said economists.Stocks sagged badly on Friday and erased what had been modest gains for the week. The S&P 500 closed 1.7 per cent lower at 1,453.55, a loss of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9 per cent to close at 13,113.38, a fall of 1.8 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9 per cent to 2,565.70, a decline of 1.2 per cent since Monday.As the corporate bond market weakened and bond yields fell sharply on Friday, bond traders said the equity market should recognise the risk of a protracted slump in the economy. They highlighted the fact that many homeowners still needed to refinance their floating rate mortgages at higher interest rates this year.“Recession risks are dwarfing rate cut hopes,” said Tony Crescenzi, strategist at Miller Tabak. “In a recession, interest rate cuts are received well only to the extent that they are seen as likely to boost cash flows, an uncertain prospect in the midst of recession.”As interest rate futures priced in a Fed funds rate of 4.57 per cent by the end of October, some analysts fear rate cuts may not help alleviate the present credit squeeze. The scramble by banks to shore up their balance sheets as commercial paper withers as a source of funding for many institutions could impede consumer credit, warn analysts.The near certainty of a rate cut this month pressured the dollar, but gold prices surged. The GLD exchange-traded fund for gold set a 52-week high of $70.The prospect of a weaker dollar and a faster growing global economy means investors should continue to focus on stocks that have international exposure, such as technology and large caps, said analysts.All 10 major sectors in the S&P were lower on Friday and for the week, the consumer discretionary sector fell 3.2 per cent amid fears over lower consumer spending.Financials declined 2.6 per cent this week, while the S&P investment bank index fell 0.8 per cent yesterday. That took its loss for the year to 16.5 per cent. Investors are still waiting to see whether Wall Street can clear a backlog of $300bn in unsold loans and bonds, associated with this year’s record buy-out deals.Lehman Brothers fell 3.4 per cent to $52.95 and Citigroup lost 3 per cent to $45.48 this week. Investors feared these banks were more exposed than others to the backlog.Shares in Countrywide Financial, the largest US mortgage lender, fell 8.3 per cent to $18.21. It is down 57 per cent this year.Another beleaguered sector, homebuilders, lost 6.8 per cent this week, taking its fall for the year to 50 per cent.Other stocks in the news this week were Apple, as it announced a new range of iPod music players and cut the price of its iPhone. The stock fell 4.8 per cent to $131.77. Tyson Foods fell 14 per cent to $18.54 as it cut its outlook due to higher food prices.
123;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-09-05T21:02:27Z;Wall St sells off on home sales data;;Wall Street stocks sold-off on Wednesday as pending home sales fell to their lowest level since September 2001 and the defensive mood was reinforced by mixed news on the economy.The meltdown in the mortgage market caused the biggest drop on record in August for pending home sales, taking the index down to the lowest level since the month that included the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.The National Association of Realtors pending home sales index, which measures contracts to buy existing homes, fell 12.2 per cent to a reading of 89.9. It is the second-lowest reading on record for the seven-year-old index, after the 89.8 reading in September 2001.Investors also responded to the Federal Reserve’s Beige book survey of regional activity, which pointed to “limited” effect on the economy from recent market turmoil, but added that distress in markets had “deepened” the housing slump in most Fed districts.Analysts had been anticipating the survey as a useful guide for policy makers to the extent of any damage to the real economy from the recent financial crises. But some analysts said it provided mixed messages.Further demonstrating the continuing impact of subprime problems, mortgage insurers MGIC Investment Corporation and Radian Group on Wednesday agreed to terminate their merger agreement two months after the deal was hit by losses at their subprime-mortgage joint venture.The news sent Radian up almost 12 per cent in early trade before settling almost 1 per cent higher at $18.27, while MGIC shares were 1 per cent lower at $30.05.The S&P Investment Banking index was down 2.3 per cent. Banks including Bear Stearns, down 4.5 per cent at $108.95, and Lehman Brothers, down 3.7 per cent at $54.35, are expected to report sharp drops in quarterly profits when they report results later this month.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 1.2 per cent lower at 1,472.29, while the Nasdaq Composite index retreated 0.9 per cent to 2,605.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.1 per cent at 13,305.47.The monthly payroll report for August is due on Friday and includes figures on government jobs. “Jobs is the big number this week, and there may be some apprehension in the equity market ahead of that report,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Analysts said a weak report would give the Federal Reserve ammunition to cut interest rates. “A weak non-farms print will provide the Fed the ‘fundamental’ cover to cut the Fed Funds rate at the September 18 meeting,” said TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Equity investors generally believe a rate cut will send the message that the Fed is prepared to help prevent any spillover of mortgage and credit problems into the broad economy.Some analysts say a rate cut this month may not immediately heal the stress in the markets. “Even if we do get a cut in the funds rate, it will not directly and immediately relieve the market’s concerns – that is, the value of collateral on the balance sheets of financial institutions,” said Gordon Fowler, chief investment officer at Glenmede.Kraft Foods boosted its full-year per-share earnings guidance to a range of $1.60-$1.62 from a range of $1.50-$1.55. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $32.60.Burlington Northern was down 0.9 per cent after Warren Buffett’s investment firm Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it may raise its stake in the railway group to 25 per cent from 15 per cent.Canadian Pacific Railway fell 3.7 per cent to $67.37 after it agreed to buy Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad for about $1.5bn in cash.Mattel stock rose 0.1 per cent, having been down 1.5 per cent earlier in the session after the toymaker recalled a third batch of Chinese-made toys. The announcement brings the total number of toys recalled by Mattel since August to more than 21m.Tyson Foods fell 12.9 per cent after it cut its 2007 earnings estimate.Shares in Yahoo advanced 0.5 per cent to $24.10 after the company agreed late on Tuesday to buy online advertising company BlueLithium for $300m.
124;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-09-05T14:42:20Z;Tyson warning on rise in livestock prices;;Tyson, the US meat producer, on Wednesday warned that rising cattle and pig prices would lead it to miss its full-year earnings target in spite of efforts to pass on rising commodity costs to consumers.The company also said a lingering trade dispute with South Korea was denting exports, although expressed confidence that its restructuring plan would leave it profitable in its fiscal fourth quarter and financial year to September 30. Its shares fell 11 per cent to $19.58 by midday in New York.Tyson and other food producers have had to adapt to higher grain and feed prices as rising global demand and falling stocks pushed up commodity costs, notably for corn, which accounts for more than a third of animal-rearing expenses.Dick Bond, who took over as chief executive of the Arkansas-based group last year, said the fourth quarter had been more “challenging” than expected, citing higher live cattle costs and the “disruption” to its South Korean beef business.Live cattle costs have climbed by almost a fifth this year, with the number of animals on US feedlots approaching a 10-year low as the prolonged drought in the south-east and northern plains damaged grazing.Tyson is the largest US beef and chicken packer, but said all its segments would be profitable in the fourth quarter. Earnings at its pork business have also been dented by higher hog prices amid reports that China, the biggest pork consumer, will boost imports.US meat producers have cut capacity following the glut in domestic supplies caused by a series of import bans imposed by in the wake of the mad cow and avian flu outbreaks.While key markets such as South Korea and Japan have been partially reopened after their effective closure in 2003, imports are running at a fraction of their previous levels because of a range of restrictions.South Korea restarted US beef imports in April, but a small consignment of contaminated meat has reawakened concerns about the market, despite efforts by the US government to link resolution of the issue with efforts to conclude a broader trade agreement with Korea.The restructuring plan launched by Mr Bond last year has returned the group to profitability, taking out $250m in annual expenses and absorbing a $300m rise in its feed bill.However, the company trimmed its full-year earnings’ forecast just four months after raising the target. It now expects earnings per share of $0.72-$0.80 compared with the $0.65-$0.90 outlined in May.Mr Bond is expected to provide further details at an investor conference later on Wednesday.
125;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-07-20T16:16:42Z;Good shepherds to the shopfloor flock;;Employees at Tyson Foods experiencing the kind of problems they might not want to take to their line managers have someone else they can approach – the corporate chaplain.“We have 125 chaplains, mostly part-time, working in the US, Canada and Mexico,” says Alan Tyson, director of chaplaincy services. “They are out in the workplace providing a ministry of availability and presence.”Corporate chaplaincy is big business in the US. Organisations such as Corporate Chaplains of America and Marketplace Chaplains USA, which provide pastoral care in the nation’s factories and offices, have thousands of chaplains on their books.“Our organisation was founded in 1984 by a military chaplain, who had seen how helpful he could be to military folk,” says Dan Truitt, vice-president of international ministries at Marketplace Chaplains USA. “Then he looked at private business and found a need there.” He cites occasions in which chaplains have found medical help for workers’ families or even conducted funerals.Although nowhere near as widespread as in the US, there are corporate chaplains in the UK, too. Reverend Mike Coley is one. “Basically, I’m there for people to talk to,” he says. “People from the shopfloor to senior management find they can open up to me. I hear about relationships, family, problems with children. Some of the stories are heartbreaking.” But there is a lighter side to the work. “I married one couple recently,” he adds.Chaplaincy in the UK tends to be ad hoc but, in the US, chaplains are normally assigned to the company and appear regularly, depending on employee needs. They build a rapport with staff and management and let them know that, if they need to talk, a chaplain is available.Chaplains are not employees of the companies to which they minister, giving them a trusted, neutral status. Typically, the company will pay a fee – in the US, up to $20 an employee a year – to the organisation, which then pays the chaplain. Most are Christian, but some are from other faiths too. Chaplains tend to have some formal training, but this is not essential.“What we are really looking for is someone with a pastor’s heart to care for folks,” Mr Tyson says.Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School, says the concept is neither new nor American. “We had corporate chaplains 40 years ago in the UK. All we are doing is reviving this,” he says, adding that job insecurity, long hours and stress could mean the time for corporate chaplains had come again.Those who use them point to obvious benefits: the workforce that has someone to talk to about its problems is generally happier. “We have recently started using Mike Coley,” says Chris Merideth, general manager of the Bristol-based Metal Centre. “At first there was a bit of ‘What’s all this?’ But now people expect to see him and know they can talk openly with him.” He thinks it helps that, as well as being a minister, Coley has a background in engineering and so is not seen as a woolly do-gooder.Mr Truitt thinks the UK could soon be seeing more chaplains in the workplace, with Marketplace Chaplains considering setting up a sister organisation.“We are still in the exploratory phase, but we have visited the UK and we know that people are interested. But we wouldn’t transplant ourselves. It would have to be a UK organisation led by UK people,” he says.Some people in the UK get a little uncomfortable at the prospect of proselytising on the shopfloor and conversions in the canteen. But the chaplains insist that they are not missionaries and will only discuss matters of faith if the employee brings them up.Should that person be of another faith, they say, they would be happy to find them a friendly rabbi or imam if required.“We’re careful never to push religion,” Mr Truitt says. “That’s not good business, and it’s not good religion.”
126;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-07-16T03:13:45Z;US food companies hit by China ban;;China has banned imports of chicken and pork products from Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor, and six other American companies, in an apparent res­ponse to US complaints over tainted Chinese exports.Authorities in Beijing have accompanied the move with the suspension of exports of mainly seafood products from 42 domestic producers, 17 of which were destined for the US.But the move against Tyson, which follows criticism aimed at China by the Bush administration last week, has raised fears that a full-blown trade dispute may be brewing.“China needs to avoid taking steps that appear to be simple retaliation and both sides need to make a big effort not to politicise the problem,” said Andy Rothman, China macro-strategist for CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. “Most signs indicate the Chinese government is taking this issue very seriously. China’s food safety regulations are basically a mirror image of those in the US. It is just a matter of getting enforcement up to snuff.”US officials appeared to be taken by surprise by the Chinese action. A spokesman for the US Trade Representative said, ”We are looking into what exactly the Chinese concerns are and whether or not their actions are consistent with their international trading obligations.”He added, ”Obviously we would go from there with respect to any kind of response.”The spokesman said the US was seeking clarification from the Chinese as to what they are doing and why. The administration is also consulting the US exporters involved to try to see if there is substance to the Chinese claims. The US will likely make a fuller response in Monday or Tuesday.Chinese exports of food and other goods to the US have come under scrutiny in recent months after a series of safety scares. The US Food and Drug Administration banned imports of some Chinese seafood last month until suppliers could prove they were safe.Beijing has shut down more than 100 food-processing plants in recent weeks and last week executed the former head of its own food and drug regulator after he was convicted of corruption.But the Bush administration last week voiced its strongest criticism to date on the issue with a stern warning from Carlos Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, that China was responsible for the safety of its exports.In apparent response China’s food safety administration announced late on Friday it had found salmonella in frozen chicken products sold to China by Tyson and in frozen chicken feet from US company Inter­vision Foods.Ractopamine, a feed additive, was found in frozen pig ears from Van Luin Foods USA, frozen pork from AJC International and frozen pork ribs from Cargill Meat Solutions and residue of an anti-parasite drug was found in frozen chicken feet from Sanderson Farms, the agency said.Imports from Cargill and Van Luin were suspended for 45 days while the remaining companies face unspecified suspension periods.Imports of sausage casings from a US company listed as “Thumph Foods” – an apparent misspelling of Triumph Foods – were suspended for 45 days for containing ractopamine.Imports of shrimp and fish from Iexco International Trading in the Philippines and Nachimex in Vietnam were also hit.Cargill, Tyson and AJC International disputed the Chinese findings in statements.In a sign Beijing is trying to address a growing international outcry, the agency announced it had temporarily suspended exports from 42 Chinese food producers whose products were tainted or did not meet food safety standards in destination countries, including the European Union, the US, and Japan.
127;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-06-19T17:32:07Z;Animal plan incites pork-barrel politics;;Any future market for bio­fuels will depend on the stance of the US, the world’s biggest consumer of transport fuels. But Washington’s propensity for pork-barrel politics means that the push for biofuels must negotiate a complex array of tax breaks and subsidies.The response to a plan by ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods to produce “renewable biodiesel” from animal fats is emblematic.Conoco and Tyson’s plan would use new technology to process and blend animal fats from the food group’s herds and flocks with conventional diesel to produce an initial 175m gallons a year of fuel. However, its commercial viability hinges on a $1 a gallon tax credit in part of the 2005 Energy Act, which opponents maintain was not intended for Conoco and Tyson’s programme.“Every place in the world, you lose money without a credit,” said Lou Burke, the US energy group’s head of alternative fuels last week after Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman from cattle and oil-rich Texas, introduced a bill that would repeal the tax break and ruin the economics of the programme.The plan has managed to upset just about everyone bar its backers. Animal rights activists claim it would push more cows towards Tyson’s abattoirs. The National Biodiesel Board argues that the entry of oil groups such as Conoco would spell doom for dozens of small producers. Even the Soap and Detergent Association has weighed in, saying that the diversion of its core feedstock could make the industry extinct.Biodiesel remains a tiny fraction of US alternative fuel output but the pattern of subsidy and support can be seen across the industry. The 2005 Energy Act and its once-lofty targets for renewable fuels, as well as more ambitious goals in the president’s State of the Union address this year, have unleashed the worst of pork-barrel politics.“The subsidies have created demand for something that wouldn’t have been there,” said Mark Williams, an energy expert at Boston University.The ethanol sector already benefits from a 51 cents-a-gallon federal subsidy, as well as assorted state benefits and 54 cents-a-gallon import tariffs which keep the flow of less expensive sugar-derived ethanol from Brazil to a trickle.Ethanol is expected to swallow a quarter of US corn production this year and food producers – led by Dick Bond, Tyson chief executive – warn of a ripple effect on global prices as animal feed prices increase and farmers substitute grain for other crops to take advantage of high prices. While $4 a bushel corn still leaves the new breed of plants – producing 100m gallons of ethanol a year – in profitable territory, equity investors can no longer expect the 40-50 per cent returns forecast last year when the crop was trading at between $3 and $3.50.The ever-larger plants producing ever more ethanol, and the scale of external investment – much of it from private equity funds – also highlight how control of the rural economy is continuing to drift away from farmers.Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City estimate that 70 per cent of ethanol plants built from 1998-2005 were farmer-owned, with communities clubbing together to build facilities producing about 50m gallons a year apiece. By last year, however, this had fallen to just 10 per cent.
128;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-04-30T20:57:53Z;Wall Street loses ground;;Wall Street lost ground on Monday, but returns for the leading benchmarks during April ran above 4 per cent, boosted by an earnings season that has exceeded expectations.Although recent data have continued to paint a mixed picture of the economic outlook, the weaker dollar has boosted shares in large companies as investors expect their earnings from foreign operations to rise.“The dollar’s demise provides a benefit for companies with substantive international exposure,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “The largest 25 firms in the S&P 500 deliver over 40 per cent of their revenue from overseas, compared to about 27 per cent for the S&P 500 overall.”Monday was a case in point as Wrigley’s first-quarter profit rise 28 per cent from a year ago, amid strong sales of chewing gum and currency gains from the weak dollar. Its shares jumped 7 per cent to $58.88.At the close on Wall Street, the S&P 500 index slid 0.8 per cent to 1,482.37, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.3 per cent to finish at 2,525.09.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,062.91, after it had set a record intra-day high of 13,162.06 in early trade.Leading the gains among blue chips was Procter & Gamble, up 2.25 per cent at $64.40 before third-quarter earnings due on Tuesday.For the month, the Dow gained 5.7 per cent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both rose 4.3 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small companies lagged the larger company benchmarks with a rise of 1.7 per cent.The pace of gains during April has some investors worried that a tough May beckons, but analysts say momentum favours buying stocks.William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading, said: “The S&P keeps sitting above 1,450, and that momentum suggests an eventual rise to around 1,575/1,600, with any pullback before then presenting a buying opportunity for investors.”The steady de-equitisation of the US market through private buy-outs and stock buy-backs continues to support stocks. The sharp rally in stocks this month has also been attributed to short sellers being squeezed out of bearish trades.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said IBM was the leading Dow stock for short sellers. Aside from IBM, Mr Ablin said other Dow companies including Coca-Cola, Microsoft and McDonald’s had also had a large rise in short selling. “Look for these names to spring higher” if the market keeps rising, Mr Ablin said.Shares in IBM rose 1 per cent to $102.21 after a rise of 7 per cent last week.Another boost for the Dow was Verizon. The telecoms group posted an 8.4 per cent rise in net profit for the first quarter, helped in part by asset sales. The result was in line with analysts’ forecasts, but investors focused on the news that it added 1.7m customers. Shares reversed an early decline to trade up 0.8 per cent at $38.18.News of deal activity left a mixed impression on stock exchanges. Shares in the NYSE Group fell 0.9 per cent to $84.33, the Chicago Board of Trade rose 1 per cent to $188.67, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange slid 1 per cent to $516.75.RadioShack said first-quarter earnings rose five-fold to $42.5m from $8.4m a year earlier. Shares in the electronics retailer rallied 4.9 per cent to $29.07.Tyson Foods, the meat producer, reported a profit of $68m during its fiscal second quarter and revised upwards earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. Its shares fell 1.1 per cent to $20.96.Kellogg reported a 7 per cent rise in quarterly earnings. The food maker boosted its outlook for the full year. That drove it to a 52-week high of $54 a share before the shares closed down 0.3 per cent at $52.91.Humana slid 2.6 per cent to $63.24 after the health insurer’s first-quarter earnings beat expectations but were down compared with a year ago. It raised its full-year earnings forecast.
129;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-04-30T12:49:30Z;Tyson Foods raises guidance;;Tyson, the world’s largest meat producer, on Monday raised its full-year earnings’ guidance after shaking off the effects of avian flu on its chicken business and higher corn costs across its operations.The US group opened a crucial reporting week for the US agribusiness sector, with conflicting views over the future path of corn and wheat prices and their impact on food and animal feed costs.Tyson has led warnings that the diversion of US corn to produce ethanol risked creating a ripple effect of higher food prices around the world. While corn prices have fallen from a peak of more than $4.50 a bushel in February, they remain well above historical levels as US farmers continue the crucial spring planting. Archer Daniels Midland, the largest US ethanol producer, reports earnings on Tuesday.Tyson did not provide fresh guidance on its outlook for corn costs – currently $4 a bushel – though it will be questioned by analysts later on Monday.However, it raised earnings guidance for its fiscal year to September 30 from $0.50-$0.80 a share to $0.65-$0.90 as a recovery in its core beef and chicken operations helped a return to profit in its second quarter.Tyson and rivals such as Pilgrims Pride – the largest US chicken producer – have cut capacity to curb the domestic glut sparked by an avian flu-inspired drop in exports last year. Prices have firmed this year, ahead of the crucial barbecue season, and Tyson has also boosted its higher-value prepared-meal business.Dick Bond, Tyson’s chief executive, has also cut more than $200m in annual operating expenses from the Arkansas-based group, shedding some commoditised units in a bid to boost margins. Exports of beef, its largest unit by sales, have also increased after Japan lifted a ban on imports from the US imposed after BSE was reported in the US herd.Food producers have expressed concern about the impact of ethanol-driven corn prices for months, but calls for a food-versus-fuel debate have grown louder in the wake of the White House plan for a five-fold rise in renewable fuel production over the next decade.Mr Bond has been among the most outspoken of food industry executives about the potential side-effects of booming ethanol production, which is set to double over the next two years, pushing corn prices to 10-year highs in recent months.Tyson announced plans last month to produce renewable diesel from animal fats in partnership with ConocoPhillips. Mr Bond said the joint venture was a ”win-win”, because it diversified renewable fuel sources away from corn towards animal fats.
130;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-04-16T15:26:14Z;Tyson and Conoco in biodiesel venture;;Tyson, the world’s largest protein producer, announced plans on Monday to produce biodiesel from animal fats in partnership with ConocoPhillips at a time of mounting concern over the impact of ethanol demand on food prices.Dick Bond, Tyson’s president and chief executive, has been a leading advocate of the need for policymakers to recognise the knock-on effects of diverting corn from animal feed to produce ethanol, warning it could lead to a ripple effect of higher global food prices.Mr Bond said the joint venture with Conoco was a “win-win”, because it diversified renewable fuel sources away from corn towards animal fats. Tyson is the largest beef producer in the US, and the second-largest producer of pork and poultry.In January, Mr Bond called on Washington to recognise the competing claims of the food and energy sectors when drawing up a proposed farm bill. ”If left unaddressed, the bigger long-term issue will be the availability of US and global grain for protein and other foods,” he warned.Mr Bond said yesterday that his views had not changed, arguing that the animal fat feedstock was used for pet food and cosmetics, rather than human consumption.“Today, fat is not a major component of food, corn is,” Mr Bond told the Financial Times. “[But] we need to make sure we do not put too much corn in the fuel side.”He said there should not be a “major“ impact on food prices, though suggested a rise in demand for animal fats could make it willing to pay “a little” more for hogs and chickens.Tyson plans to use half of the animal fat derived from its operations, with annual production expected to expand over 18 months to 175m gallons, helped by a $1 a gallon tax credit. Biodiesel remains less popular in the US than in Europe, with current production of 864m gallons a year, according to the National Biodiesel Board, just 15 per cent of the present output of ethanol.The two companies said the move would increase energy security, mirroring the US administration’s position that increased renewable fuel production – boosted by tax credits and subsidies – will reduce the reliance on imports of fossil fuels.However, other policy experts maintain the current subsidy system is distorting market prices, while the surge in demand for corn-derived ethanol threatens to increase global hunger.“The danger is that we are moving to a world of food insecurity,” said Lester Brown, head of the Washington-based Earth Policy Institute. Mr Brown has been a long-time proponent of the need for markets to price in the impact of climate change and energy efficiency, and warned that rising global food prices threaten to accelerate the destabilisation of weak political regimes.Conoco, like other oil and gas groups, has been investing in renewable fuel production and technology, helped in part by the grants and subsidies on offer. However, some critics point to the lukewarm response of the industry in marketing renewables, particularly the lukewarm response to E85, a fuel with a large ethanol content.While the pro-ethanol and renewable fuel lobby is now well organised in the US ahead of a new farm bill expected this year, consumer groups are only starting to highlight rising food prices as a potential knock-on effect.Tyson’s move also highlights splits within the agricultural community. Big ethanol producers such as Archer Daniels Midland also insist there is no conflict because better technology will boost corn yields to meet the demand for animal feed and ethanol. However, Cargill – which is also expanding its ethanol production – has maintained that use of corn has to be prioritised in terms of “food, feed and fuel – in that order” – and called for a wider national debate.Tyson said production of its renewable diesel is expected to start later this year, and could add between 4 cents and 16 cents a share to annual earnings, depending on diesel and animal fat prices.
131;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-02-16T02:21:05Z;Investors get go-ahead to sue directors;;Directors of US companies involved in the options backdating scandal could be vulnerable to lawsuits and damage claims from disgruntled shareholders following two decisions by an influential Delaware court.The recent rulings by the Chancery Court of Delaware, the state where most US companies are registered, are likely to make it easier for investors to press forward with cases alleging that directors’ approval of backdated stock options breached their fiduciary duty towards shareholders.The options scandal already has engulfed close to 200 companies and several executives, including Myron Olesnyckyj, the former Monster Worldwide general counsel who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in federal court in New York on Thursday.In a Delaware case involving the Californian chip maker Maxim Integrated Products, Judge William Chandler ruled that former chairman and chief executive John Gifford and six past directors must face a “derivative lawsuit” filed by shareholders.The suit alleges that the directors’ approval of backdated stock options contravened their role as guardians of the company’s interests.Unlike regular class-action lawsuits, in which investors must show they personally lost money, derivative lawsuits seek to redress harm to the company itself.“A director who approves the backdating of options faces at the very least a substantial likelihood of liability,” the judge wrote in the ruling, issued earlier this month. “If only because it is difficult to conceive of a context in which a director may simultaneously lie to his shareholders…and yet satisfy his duty of loyalty.”In a separate case, against Tyson Foods, the court raised the possibility that directors who received “spring-loaded” grants - options awarded just before positive news announcements - could face damage claims.Judge Chandler’s decision to allow the Maxim derivative lawsuit to go forward puts additional pressure on directors at other companies where options backdating occurred.In these cases, the distinction between derivative and class action lawsuits could be critical because in many cases there is little evidence the backdating caused stock price drops, but much better evidence that improper accounting for the options affected corporate bottom lines.The opinion is also helpful to shareholders on the issue of the statute of limitations, said Fiona Philip, a former SEC attorney now at Howrey & Simon.Ordinarily investors must sue within three years of an alleged bad act. However, Judge Chandler held that Maxim shareholders qualified for an exception because they had no way of knowing about backdated options until earlier this year, when Merrill Lynch published a statistical analysis showing that the options were granted at unusual opportune moments.“This is good news for plaintiffs,” Ms Philip said. “He’s one of the most influential judges in Delaware and Delaware is the place where corporations look for legal guidance.”
132;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-01-29T23:04:16Z;Tyson warns on food versus fuel conflict;;"Tyson, the world’s largest protein producer, on Monday warned that boosting US ethanol production would spill over into higher global food prices.The US group said consumers would bear the brunt of domestic price increases being pushed through to compensate for the near-doubling of corn costs last year, spurred in part by the competing claim on the crop to make ethanol.Food producers have expressed concern about the effect of ethanol-driven corn prices for months but calls for a food-versus-fuel debate have grown louder in the wake of last week’s White House plan for a five-fold rise in renewable fuel production over the next decade.However, Tyson executives said “this was not just a US phenomenon”, with animal-feed prices being “reset throughout the world” to reflect higher demand.Dick Bond, Tyson’s president and chief executive, has already called on Washington to recognise the competing claims of the food and energy sectors when drawing up a proposed new farm bill. “If left unaddressed, the bigger long-term issue will be the availability of US and global grain for protein and other foods,” he said on Monday.“We fully support efforts toward renewable energy; however, as the food-versus-fuel debate unfolds, we must carefully consider the negative and unintended consequences of over-using grains.”Mike Johanns, the US agriculture secretary, is expected to provide more details of the proposed farm bill this week after calling for more funds for research into alternative energy. He also wants farm subsidies reformed. Critics believe the debate has been one-sided in favour of the much-vaunted US plan to improve “energy security” by boosting subsidised renewable energy production.Big ethanol producers such as Archer Daniels Midland also insist there is no conflict because better technology will boost corn yields to meet the demand for animal feed and ethanol.Mr Bond sought to counter these arguments by pointing out that distillers’ grain – a byproduct of ethanol production – was an imperfect substitute for corn-derived animal feed. “We need to decide as a country what the proper balance is,” he said."
133;TSN;Tyson Foods;2007-01-29T21:48:41Z;Wall Street retreats as bond yields rise;;Wall Street languished on Monday, as a mix of quarterly earnings results and several deals were offset by a further rise in bond yields.Analysts said equity investors were in a defensive mood ahead of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve set to start on Tuesday. Investors are also awaiting inflation, manufacturing and employment data this week.Acquisition activity was led by banks as Merrill Lynch announced that it would buy First Republic Bank in a $1.8bn deal.Shares in First Republic surged 40 per cent to $53.63, while Merrill dipped 2.3 per cent to $92.39.Citigroup said it was buying Egg Banking from Prudential of the UK for $1.13bn. Shares in Citigroup fell 1.1 per cent to $54.06.Shares in Bank of America and Countrywide Financial were mixed as investors digested a Financial Times report on Friday that BofA and the nation’s largest mortgage lender were in talks about a possible merger. Shares in Countrywide rose 3.3 per cent to $43.38, after a rise of 4.2 per cent on Friday. BofA was 1.1 per cent lower at $51.46 late in New York.Analysts at CreditSights said: “Even a joint venture as an initial step to a total buy-out makes sense since Bank of America needs to fill a $100bn gap in its balance sheet.” CreditSights said Countrywide’s $88bn of prime mortgage assets on its balance sheet could be funded “more economically” via “Bank of America’s cheap core deposit base”.In the newsprint industry Abitibi-Consolidated and Bowater announced a merger. Shares in Bowater jumped 24 per cent to $27.44, and Abitibi rose 26 per cent to $3.33.Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 4.7 per cent to $27.43 amid buy-out talk for the drug company.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,420.62, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent at 2,441.09.

Its shares rose 3.5 per cent to $17.28 as earnings of 16 cents a share were well above estimates of 6 cents.Shares in Schering-Plough fell 1.1 per cent to $24.82, as its fourth-quarter net income jumped due to better sales of prescription pharmaceuticals and cholesterol drugs.At this point in the earnings season, analysts have noted the relative lack of earnings that have surprised and surpassed expectations.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, advised investors to “take advantage of current earnings misperceptions” and buy integrated energy and chip stocks, but maintain “some caution still on the banks and materials names”.
134;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-12-19T19:33:23Z;LBO activity aids investor protection;;Leveraged buy-out activity not only drove record high-yield bond issuance this year, it also had a tangible impact on the investment-grade market.As corporate management teams have become more responsive to activist shareholders and private equity firms, buyers of US high-grade bonds have been increasingly demanding covenant protections – contract terms that protect bondholders against excessive corporate leveraging, which are common in Europe. According to recent research from Bear Stearns, investors find these protections so valuable that they are willing to accept 15-25 basis points less in coupons for bonds with additional covenants.“The market is apparently placing a higher price on event risk protection in Black & Decker, CRH America, Federated, Mohawk Industries, Temple Inland, Tyson Foods and Universal Health,” says Victor Consoli, credit strategist at Bear Stearns.Increasing numbers of issuers are responding, with the inclusion of change of control puts – which force the company to buy back debt at full value if there is a takeover – and coupon step-ups – which force a company to pay more interest on the debt if there is a deterioration in creditworthiness.Home Depot, the A-rated home improvement retailer, which last month was the subject of takeover rumours, is the latest company to include a change-of-control clause in the bond indentures for its $5bn bond financing, priced last week.The change of control option would force the company to pay bondholders 101 per cent of the bond’s face value if a buy-out results in the company’s downgrade to junk status.“For an $86bn market-cap company [this] is a true sign of the times,” says Mr Consoli.In the past, investment-grade bonds in the US have rarely had any covenants to protect the bondholder against, for example, a management team seeking to boost its share price with big stock repurchases.As investors in the covenant-light bonds of HCA, the hospital operator recently discovered, a management team that embarks on the LBO trail can be disastrous. HCA’s buy-out caused the company’s benchmark 10-year bonds to lose 20 per cent of their value.Just as LBO activity has shown equity investors the value of leverage, analysts say, bondholders are using covenants to steel themselves for more equity friendly activity from corporate management. Home Depot’s recent bond deal, for example, was used to fund stock buy-backs – just the latest in a string of such deals this year.As one head of debt syndicate says: “Either you’re going to buy back your stock, or someone else is.”
135;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Tyson warning in food-versus-fuel debate;;Tyson, the world’s largest protein producer, on Monday weighed into the food-versus-fuel debate with a warning that ethanol-driven corn prices would push up the cost of beef and chicken for US consumers.Rising ethanol production has driven corn prices to record levels despite two good harvests, raising fears that the fuel additive would squeeze out the availability of grain for animal feeds.Dick Bond, Tyson’s president and chief executive, called on Washington to recognise the competing claims when drawing up a proposed new farm bill next year, amid support on both sides of Congress for ethanol production to rise as part of a renewable fuels strategy.“I believe that the American consumer is going to have to pay more for protein,” Mr Bond told analysts as the company reported a full-year loss as rising costs combined with sluggish sales.“The consumer is ultimately going to have to pay for the higher grain costs,” said Mr Bond. “The farm bill is the key in 2007. [The food industry] needs to make sure our legislators know what effect this is having on food-versus-fuel.”Mr Bond’s remarks are the clearest statement to date of the unease felt among food producers about rising grain prices, and could prompt a clash over the competing interests of the energy and food sectors.Feedstock producers - who stand to gain from higher prices - are expected to gain an influential voice in Washington this week when Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat from a corn and sugarbeet-farming district, becomes chair of the House agricultural committee.The congressman will play a leading role in shaping the Farm Bill and will be able to count on strong party support for advancing a renewable fuels strategy.Leading ethanol producers such as Archer Daniels Midland, the US market leader, insist there is no competition between food and fuel.Pat Woertz, ADM’s chairman and chief executive, last week said that a combination of market forces and new technology would provide supplies for both sectors. Ms Woertz told reporters that rising corn prices would prompt farmers to plant more corn, while biotechnology was improving crop yields.However, Mr Bond suggested that the two sectors are in competition. “We will be trying to make sure there is enough feed for food, as opposed to just feed for fuel,” he said, noting that consumer demand would see all of the higher grain prices passed on to consumers.He noted that rising ethanol production could benefit some food producers because of an increase in the supply of distiller’s grain, a byproduct of fuel production used as an animal feed. “There may be more cattle feed in the upper Midwest [where ethanol production is concentrated], which is positive for us as that’s where many of our cattle are located.”Mr Bond, who was promoted to become CEO last May, said improving supply and demand conditions in the protein sector could see the company make a profit in its fiscal first quarter to end December after three successive losses.Tyson has cut costs and production after fears over avian flu led to a slump in chicken exports and oversupply in the domestic market, while beef shipments remain restricted by concerns over BSE.Japan ended its ban on US exports earlier this month following inspections of the US cattle stock, but Mr Bond said shipments to what had been its largest overseas market remained at just a quarter of pre-BSE levels. Moreover, exports to South Korea were at a “standstill” because of uncertainty over the terms of the ban relaxed earlier this year..
136;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-09-28T13:50:49Z;Pilgrim’s Pride bids $1bn for rival;;Pilgrim’s Pride triggered a chicken war on Thursday with the launch of a hostile $1bn (£532m) offer for Gold Kist which would create the largest poultry producer in the US.The unsolicited offer comes after six weeks of fruitless talks between the two groups. Pilgrim has pursued Gold Kist for more than two years and saw two proposals rejected by the Atlanta-based company before announcing plans for a $20-a share bid on August 18.Pilgrim’s tender offer retained the $20 a share terms, plus the assumption of $144m in debt, and extends through October 27. The offer matches Gold Kist’s 52-week high and represented a 55 per cent premium to the stock’s pre-announcement close on August 18. The shares have traded just above $20 over the past six weeks.Gold Kist had expressed irritation with Pilgrim’s tactics, and said last month it was “surprised and disappointed” that the company had opted to take its proposal direct to shareholders after consenting to limited due diligence on a proposal made in July. The company has hired Gleacher, the boutique investment bank, to advise on its strategic options, but has not ruled out a deal with Pilgrim.Pilgrim said on Thursday that Gold Kist had not taken any “meaningful steps” to reach an agreement. “We would have preferred to work together with Gold Kist and its board of directors to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement for our respective shareholders, employees, business partners and other stakeholders,” said a statement from OB Goolsby, Pilgrim’s president and chief executive officer.A deal would create the US market leader with a quarter of sales, overtaking Tyson Foods at a time when domestic prices and export revenues are recovering from the depressed levels caused by fears over avian flu.The US is the world’s largest producer and consumer of chicken and the domestic industry has consolidated to the stage where the top five players account for half of sales.Pilgrim more than doubled the size of its chicken business with the December 2003 purchase of ConAgra’s poultry unit, and said it planned to maintain Gold Kist’s grower base, which is concentrated in the south-east US.Gold Kist is the market leader in providing white-label products to retailers, but has lost market share in recent years, a development which analysts attribute to a lack of strategic flexibility. The company converted from a co-operative in 2004, and farmers account for around a fifth of its shareholder base.Pilgrim said it did not plan any major plant consolidations and would maintain existing relationships with growers, a move designed to appeal to the farmer base.The family-controlled Pilgrim group has shrunk its loss-making turkey business and built a national distribution network to serve the food service industry.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent, or 17.93 points, at 11,369.94.Consumer confidence fell more than expected in August, pushing stocks lower for the first half of the trading day.However, markets pared much of their losses immediately after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s August meeting, which revealed that most members of the Fed’s Open Market Committee believed that core inflation would “decline gradually” as a result of slowing economic growth, even though inflation risks remained.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that investors took heart from some of the language in the Fed minutes.“The key here is that the Fed focused on the economy instead of focusing on inflation,” he said. “If they’re worried about the pace of the economy, it’s less of a risk of them raising rates.”Regional bank First Horizon National slipped 4 per cent to $38.47 after it said third-quarter pre-tax earnings would fall by $56m because of weakness in its mortgage banking business and a $21m charge relating to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. Mortgage lender Countrywide Financial fell 1.7 per cent to $33.02.Brokerage stocks also suffered after equity analysts expressed pessimism about third-quarter earnings for the sector. Lehman Brothers fell 3 per cent to $62.48 and Bear Stearns also dropped 3 per cent to $129.85.Defensive healthcare stocks were in demand. Tenet Healthcare ticked up 2.8 per cent to $7.61, and Cigna also added 2.8 per cent to reach a three-month high of $115.13. The S&P Managed Health index is up 8 per cent in August.Graphics chip maker Nvidia rose 4.5 per cent to $28.40. Ebay followed through on Monday’s bounce from its advertising deal with Google, rising 5.4 per cent to $27.17. However, Adobe Systems slid 3 per cent to $31.86.The glum picture on consumer confidence did not stop several consumer-
oriented stocks from moving higher. Jeweller Tiffany & Co climbed for a second day, adding 4 per cent to $33.17. Brown Forman, maker of Jack Daniels whisky, added 3.4 per cent to $76.84. On Monday, Brown Forman said it would buy two Mexican tequila brands for $876m."
138;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Gold Kist to consider $1bn Pilgrim bid;;Gold Kist, the US poultry producer, on Monday said it would consider an unsolicited $1bn-plus bid from Pilgrim’s Pride but expressed irritation with the tactics of its larger rival after months of talks.Pilgrim’s offer would create the US market leader with a quarter of sales, overtaking Tyson Foods at a time when domestic prices and export revenues are recovering from the depressed levels caused by fears over avian flu.It revealed its proposal on August 18 after pursuing Gold Kist for two years and making two proposals this year.Pilgrim’s would offer $20 a share for Gold Kist and assume $144m in debt, matching its target’s 52-week stock-price high and providing a 55 per cent premium to the close on August 18. Gold Kist shares rose 47 per cent to $19.02 on Monday.Gold Kist said it was “surprised and disappointed” that Pilgrim’s had opted to take its proposal direct to shareholders after consenting to limited due diligence on the latest proposal, made in July.The US is the world’s largest producer and consumer of chicken. The industry has consolidated to the stage where the top five players account for half of sales.Pilgrim’s more than doubled the size of its chicken business with the December 2003 purchase of ConAgra’s poultry unit, and said it planned to maintain Gold Kist’s grower base, which is concentrated in the south-east US.Gold Kist is the market leader in providing white-label products to retailers, but has lost market share in recent years – a development analysts attribute to a lack of strategic flexibility. The company converted from a co-operative in 2004.

The company lowered its full-year sales guidance. Its shares tumbled 4 per cent to $28.35. The stock is down 15 per cent since the beginning of the year. Home Depot followed Lowe’s, shedding 1.4 per cent to $34.30.Ford Motor lost 7.5 per cent to $7.47 – its worst day since April – following Friday’s announcement of production cutbacks, including the mothballing of 10 assembly plants, to reduce inventory and speed up its turnround plan.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 4.78 points, at 1,297.52.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, or 36.42 points, to 11,345.05.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors, attributed the falls to investors taking money off the table following the strong gains of last week. “It’s a pullback, but its predictable,” he said. “We had a pretty unusual week [last week] and so it’s natural to expect some profit-taking.”Energy stocks bounced back as crude pushed higher on geopolitical concerns. Exxon Mobil added 1.1 per cent to $69.83 and Marathon Oil rose 3.1 per cent to $89.94.Transport stocks were hit by the gains in crude.

It added 5 per cent to $36.05.Apple Computer rose 3.6 per cent to $67.96 after Bank of America raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”. Dell, however, lost 2.4 per cent to $21.68.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent, or 1.89 points, at 1,276.66, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent, or 2.67 points, lower at 2,091.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent, or 34.02 points, to 11,185.68.Avon Products lost 11.6 per cent to $28.99 after the maker of cosmetics and beauty goods reported a 54 per cent slump in second-quarter profits, which it attributed to charges related to restructuring costs.Tyson Foods sank after it reported a quarterly loss of $52m, greater than analysts had expected. The food manufacturer forecast a total loss for the year worse than Wall Street forecasts, pushing its shares down 2.9 per cent to $14.15.Footlocker rose 3.5 per cent to $27.17 on news that private equity firms interested in a buy-out might pay more than had been expected for the footwear retailer.Sirius Satellite Radio gained 1.5 per cent to $4.20 after a deal with Mitsubishi to install its radios on four of the carmaker’s 2007 models and all of its 2008 models.

141;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-07-31T17:27:48Z;Tyson looks abroad to fill vacancies;;Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor by sales, is recruiting workers from China and the Philippines in an effort to solve a labour shortage at its Canadian operation.The US group is also targeting the Ukraine and El Salvador to fill gaps in its plants in the province of Alberta, where the boom in oil-sands exploration has driven economic growth to 6.6 per cent – twice the national average – and cut unemployment to 3.7 per cent.The skills squeeze is causing energy groups such as Royal Dutch Shell to re-evaluate the economics of their oil-sands exploration, and led the province last week to announce a 10-year plan to attract more overseas workers.Tyson is the first company to launch a recruitment drive under the plan, which would allow sponsored overseas workers to work in Canada for a year. The staff shortage has reduced productivity at its Alberta plants and worsened the problems caused by the strength of the Canadian dollar.Dick Bond, Tyson’s new president and chief executive, said the company was working with the Alberta authorities. “We are going to four countries throughout the world to try and get the plants staffed,” he told analysts on Monday.“You walk down the street in Edmonton and there are ‘help wanted” signs everywhere,” said Joanne Hall at the commercial division of Alberta’s ministry of agriculture, food and rural development. She said the temporary foreign worker programme would apply to skilled and unskilled staff, though there are no fixed targets for overseas recruitment.The recruitment drive by Tyson, which employs 114,000 staff worldwide, comes as the company raised its full-year loss estimate despite signs that a glut of beef and chicken supplies is easing.Consumer concerns over BSE and avian flu have depressed sales at the US group, the country’s largest supplier of beef and chicken, while exports have been curtailed by the continuing ban on beef imports by key Asian buyers, notably Japan.Tyson has replaced its senior management and embarked on a cost-cutting campaign in an attempt to restore profitability.However, the beef and chicken businesses – which represent three-quarters of its $26bn sales – suffered losses in the quarter to July 1. Restructuring charges led the group to forecast a loss per share of 41-51 cents in the 12 months to September 30, well above the 17-cent consensus among analysts.Tyson said its poultry business should return to profit in the current quarter as the company cut production, while its beef unit could benefit from the easing of the Japanese import ban instituted at the end of 2003.Japan last week said it would permit limited imports from the US in August after inspecting 34 beef processing plants, including a number operated by Tyson. However, the agreement is restricted to cattle under 20 months of age and will only open up around 10 per cent of the US herd. The US continues to negotiate with China and South Korea in a bid to regain access for beef exports.Mr Bond described the latest quarter as “disappointing” as weak chicken prices and higher energy costs pulled the group to a $52m net loss in the fiscal third quarter. It made a profit of $131m in the same period last year.Mr Bond plans to cut $200m in costs and boost sales of higher-margin prepared foods, as well as increase the contribution of international sales. He said Tyson would raise prices for its foodservice clients – which supply restaurants – to counter higher energy costs.With the oversupply in beef easing, Mr Bond also sought to ease concerns that the drought in parts of the US would hit cattle levels in 2007. He said herd-counts are at the second-highest level on record, and expected to rise next year.
142;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-07-31T14:23:54Z;Tyson cuts forecast for year;;Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor by sales, on Monday raised its full-year loss estimate despite signs that the glut of beef and chicken supplies was easing.Consumer concerns over BSE and avian flu have depressed sales at the US group, the country’s largest supplier of beef and chicken, while exports have been curtailed by the continuing ban on beef exports by key Asian buyers, notably Japan.Tyson has replaced its senior management and embarked on a cost-cutting campaign in a bid to restore profitability, and said on Monday that the supply-demand imbalance was starting to ease.However, the beef and chicken businesses – which represent three-quarters of its $26bn sales – suffered losses in the quarter to July 1, and restructuring charges led the group to forecast a loss per share of 41-51 cents in the 12 months to September 30, well above the 17-cent consensus among analysts. Its share price fell almost 6 per cent to $13.71 in early trade.Tyson said its poultry business should return to profit in the current quarter as the current oversupply eased from historic highs as the company cut production, while its beef unit could benefit from the easing of the Japanese import ban instituted at the end of 2003.Japan last week said it would permit limited imports from the US in August after inspecting 34 beef processing plants, including a number operated by Tyson.

143;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-07-13T14:22:18Z;Tyson Foods to axe 420 jobs;;Tyson Foods on Thursday announced a larger-than-expected cost-cutting plan aimed at returning the world’s largest meat processor to profitability amid volatile market and regulatory conditions.The proposed cuts represent about a fifth of the US group’s general and administrative cost base, and exceeds the $110m in savings outlined by Richard Bond when he was promoted to become chief executive in May.Mr Bond had called on the company to become more “agile” in dealing with the impact of trade disputes, avian flu and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which have combined to depress exports and leave a glut in the domestic market. It plans to cut 420 jobs - mainly management and support staff - from a global workforce of 114,000, and freeze some hiring.Analysts expect Tyson to lose about $70m in its financial year to September 30 on sales of $26bn, and Mr Bond said the latest restructuring will lead to a $10m-$15m charge against fourth-quarter earnings, with most of the expected savings coming through in 2007.“We realise we can’t save our way back to profitability,” said Mr Bond in a statement, reaffirming its efforts to sell more value-added products such as fresh chicken and marinated beef. More than half of its sales were still in commodity poultry, beef and pork products, and Tyson last week replaced its marketing chief.Rising cattle numbers and the seasonal ramp-up in demand for the US barbecue season have also improved margins in beef - Tyson’s largest segment by sales.Mr Bond also identified the need to expand its international business, and much could hinge on the successful resolution of the dispute between the US and Japan over beef exports. Japan barred imports of US beef following concerns over BSE, but resumed imports in June following a five-month ban.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 12.88 points, at 11,103.55.“We got some of the macro-economic data out of the way last week and now people will be focusing on earnings,” said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak.Brian Williamson, equity trader at Boston Company Asset Management, said the weak trading volume was giving rise to considerable swings in stock prices.“There was very light volume today, and moves tend to be fairly exaggerated when volume is light,” he said.An unhealthy pallor on technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. EMC fell
6.9 per cent to $10.41 after the maker of data storage equipment said second-quarter profits and revenues would not reach forecasts.Sandisk was off 8.2 per cent to $43.56 while Hewlett Packard, a strong gainer in recent weeks, dropped 2.8 per cent to $31.93.Corning, maker of liquid crystal glass displays, fell 5.3 per cent to $20.97. The stock has shed more than 27 per cent since April.Athletic shoe retailer Foot Locker leapt 10 per cent to $27.32 following reports that the private equity group Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, might bid for the company.Other retailers also did well. Gap added 5.7 per cent to $17.57, its best day since November 2004. Drugstore chain CVS added 2.8 per cent to $31.31 after it reported a better than expected 8.4 per cent gain in same-store sales in June, driven by prescription medications.CVS rival Rite Aid gained 4 per cent to $4.40 on the news, and Walgreens was up 1.9 per cent to $46.73.Consumer staples made strong advances on the back of a sector upgrade by Merrill Lynch. Kellogg rose 1.9 per cent to $48.45, and Conagra jumped 2 per cent to $22.29. An upgrade from JPMorgan pushed Tyson Foods up 5.7 per cent to $15.28. The stock was raised from “neutral” to “overweight”.Oil dropped below $74 on optimism regarding talks between Iran and the European Union that begin this week. The slide in crude boosted airline stocks, with AMR, parent of American Airways, gaining 3.3 per cent to $27.66, while Southwest gained 2.3 per cent to $17.37 on hopes of cheaper fuel.Softer crude prices did not feed through to oil services group Schlumberger, however, which rose 1.2 per cent to $63.50 after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock from $66 to $75."
145;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-05-01T22:50:17Z;Migrants’ walk-outs hit business across US;;US farms, restaurants, meat processing companies and other businesses were hit by walkouts on Monday as hundred of thousands of immigrants across the country rallied to underscore their importance to the economy and to protest against legislation that would target illegal migrants.In Los Angeles, where the the protest march stretched out for more than mile and was growing late on Monday, local reports said that only 10 per cent of the truckers serving the Port of Los Angeles turned up. The union representing California farmworkers said tens of thousands had joined marches and rallies, leaving many fields empty for a day.Florida fruit and vegetable growers similarly reported that about half of farm workers did not show up on Monday. In the Midwest, the top US meat processors, including Tyson Foods, Cargill and Swift, shut their operations for the day. And the country’s largest Hispanic-owned food company, Goya Foods, suspended deliveries throughout the US in support of the boycott.The work stoppages and the demonstrations – which included huge marches in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia – marked the latest and biggest in an escalating series of protests.Sonia Umanzor, a nurse who marched in Washington, DC, said she had pulled her daughter out of school and had received permission from her employer to skip work and join in the day-long boycott. She said: “A lot of people start to see us as criminals and don’t trust us. And we are the ones working hard in the worst jobs.”The demonstrators are objecting to legislation passed by the US House of Representatives that would criminalise illegal immigration and drastically increase barriers and police enforcement along the US border with Mexico. The US Senate is divided over more liberal legislation that would toughen enforcement but allow many of the country’s nearly 12m undocumented immigrants to remain legally.Most companies appeared to have planned in advance to avoid serious disruptions. Mary Price Burk, a partner with Baker & Hostetler in Denver, said that none of her business clients had reported any problems in spite of large demonstrations there. “People are working with it, and it’s not having a substantial negative effect,” she said.The biggest effects appeared to be on restaurants, construction projects and small retail businesses, though hotels and casinos reported little disruption.At the Old Ebbitt Grill, a popular Washington restaurant just a block from the White House, the take-out shop was offering a sharply scaled-back menu on Monday and most of the staff were absent. The usually cramped short-order kitchen was quiet. “Everyone who asked for the day off got the day off,” said a manager who was filling in.
146;TSN;Tyson Foods;2006-01-30T22:00:36Z;Wall Street ends mixed despite Exxon gains;;"Record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant higher on Monday but gains in the wider market were limited by investors’ reluctance to take on new positions ahead of the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Tuesday.“It’s a wait and see day,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “People are waiting for clues from the Fed on the future direction of interest rate hikes.”After struggling to make headway throughout much of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 10,899.92, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent at 1,285.20. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.1 per cent to 2,306.78.Oil and energy stocks were among the session’s best performers, with ExxonMobil rising 3 per cent to $63.11 after it reported a 23 per cent jump in fourth-quarter underlying profit. High oil and gas prices helped push the Dow component’s fourth-quarter net income to $10.71bn, or $1.71 a share, from $8.42bn, or $1.30 a share, earned a year ago.The results lifted shares in other energy stocks. Halliburton, whose price target was raised by analysts at UBS and Citigroup, rose 2.5 per cent to $80.86 while Marathon Oil gained 2 per cent to $76.55. Overall, the Amex oil index rose 2.3 per cent.By contrast, pharmaceutical stocks sank, with Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin and Clarinex allergy drugs, dropping 2.5 per cent to $19.57 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly profits.Eastman Kodak and Tyson Foods, the meat processor, also fell after reporting
disappointing fourth-quarter figures.Kodak, which is undergoing a costly and painful transition towards digital technology, lost 2.4 per cent to $25.75 while Tyson Foods, hurt by weak pork and beef sales, plunged 7.2 per cent to $14.27.However, investors were more forgiving with toymaker Mattel, which reported a slight profit decline. However the performance was still better than expected. This, combined with plans for a $250m share buyback, helped shares in the Barbie doll maker climb 6.9 per cent to $15.80.In other earning news, Wal-Mart, which had a lacklustre fourth-quarter, said it was expecting January sales to rise 4.7 per cent, better than the 3-4 per cent increase previously forecast. Its shares moved up 1.2 per cent to $46.41.On the deals front, Fairmont Hotels & Resortsrose after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia agreed to buy the Canadian luxury hotelier for $3.9bn or $45 a share, thwarting a rival bid from corporate raider Carl Icahn. Shares in Fairmont gained 1 per cent to $44.27.Elsewhere, talk that Apple Computer might be coming out with a new line of iBook laptops as early as April helped drive the stock 4.1 per cent higher to $75."

The Nasdaq Composite index also fell 0.1 per cent to 2,200.95.Wal-Mart kicked off a busy week for retailers, most of which are expected to release quarterly results this week.The retail behemoth rose 0.6 per cent to $49.30 after it posted a 4 per cent jump in third quarter earnings, meeting market expectations.Solid third-quarter earnings also pushed home improvement retailer Lowes up 4.7 per cent to $64.89, while larger rival Home Depot rode its coat-tails, climbing 1.6 per cent to $42.57.In contrast, meat producer Tyson Foods came under pressure after third-quarter earnings fell below analyst expectations. Its shares tumbled 10.8 per cent to $16.51.Deal talk also swirled around Knight Ridder, the newspaper publisher. Its shares rose 1 per cent to $63.10 after the group said it was considering putting itself up for sale in response to mounting pressure from shareholders.Starwood Hotels and Resorts rose 1.3 per cent to $60.02 after it agreed to sell 38 of its properties to Host Marriott for about $4.1bn. Host Marriott fell 4.5 per cent to $16.65.Reports that talks of Computer Sciences’ possible sale to Lockheed Matin had stalled failed to rattle investors. CSC rose 4.1 per cent to $55 on the news, while Lockheed edged up 0.7 per cent to to $59.79.Elsewhere, blue chip heavyweights Hewlett-Packard and Motorola respectively fell 1.1 per cent to $28.20 and 3 per cent to $22.86 after the two companies had their ratings downgraded by sector analysts.
148;TSN;Tyson Foods;2005-09-01T19:42:27Z;Katrina could alter course of Fed;;George W. Bush, US president, and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, met on Thursday to discuss the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina - a meeting that stoked already intense speculation as to whether the Fed might put on hold its steady progression of interest rate hikes.In what is normally the second-quietest week of the year, dealers have reported unusually heavy trading as the enormous physical and economic implications of the storm become clearer.“Katrina’s effects are felt nationally . . . and appear a whole lot bigger and far-reaching than [the 1996 storms in the northeastern US] or any other natural disaster in recent times,” said David Rosenberg, US economist at Merrill Lynch, in research published yesterday, noting the potential impact of the storm on transport arteries and food production and storage.“Everyone is focused on energy, but just ask the folks at Cargill, Tyson Foods or Archer Daniels what all this means for their businesses – and keep in mind that food accounts for nearly 15 per cent of the consumer spending pie versus 5 per cent for energy.”“People are now expecting a very weak fourth quarter or first quarter,” said Rick Klingman, head of US Treasury trading at ABN Amro. Last week, the markets were pricing in at least two more quarter-point hikes in the Fed funds rate, which is currently 3.5 per cent, by December.“Now they are talking about Fed rate rises being taken off the table for the rest of the year.”The December Fed funds futures contract, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, has risen to 96.245 from 95.92 since Monday, implying the market now believes the Fed funds target will be no more than 3.75 per cent at the end of this year. Currently, the rate is 3.5 per cent. And the rise in the February contract, from 95.76 to 96.195, suggests the market thinks that 3.75 per cent might well be the final peak of the cycle, compared to its expectations just last week of a 4.25 per cent rate.Eurodollar futures – interest rate contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – have also risen as rate rise expectations have been scaled back.Brian Garvey, a senior strategist at State Street, noted that the shift in eurodollars was the largest three-day move in US rate expectations since the days immediately following September 11 2001.“Katrina has created a lot of uncertainty, and certainly provides an excuse for the Fed to step back and assess the effects not only of the hurricane but also of its prior tightening,” said Mr Garvey.He added the Fed could be in a “fog” for several months as it analysed the impact of the storm.Treasuries also leapt again on Thursday, sending yields to fresh two-month lows. Yields on two-year notes reached a low of 3.695 per cent while the 10-year yield slipped below 4 per cent for the first time since June.This is the fifth time in a year that 10-year yields have dropped below 4 per cent, though on no occasion have they held below the psychologically important level for more than eight days.“This is the first break that coincides with a major shift in rate expectations, and perhaps this could be more sustainable,” added Mr Garvey.John Roberts, managing director, rates at Barclays Capital, concurred that traders were “looking for a pause [by the Fed] in September or November”. But he thinks the pessimism is overdone – at least for now.“Is this going to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back and makes the US economy go into recession? I don’t think so,” he said.“[Katrina] does have some impact on the economy, but third quarter GDP is going to print 4 per cent, so if we go back to 3.5 per cent, is that a disaster? No.”Mr Roberts said the ability to get oil refineries around the Gulf of Mexico running again is the key to the longer-term impact of Katrina, with the restoration of petrol production particularly important.Petrol shortages could make the upcoming Labor Day holiday appear to be “a disaster”, according to Mr Roberts. But he said the swing in the market’s psychology had gone too far and could reverse within a few weeks.“The Fed can sit and watch, there’s plenty of time until the next meeting,” he added. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled for September 20.Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast, also doubts the Fed will change course. “There is of course no such thing as a free lunch, and speculation goes that the president will also subtly ask the Fed chairman to hold off on rate hikes,” he said in a research note. “We remain sceptical that the Fed chairman will oblige.”

But the broader market was flat, caught between positive economic news and a renewed surge in oil prices.Mark Mahaney, analyst at Smith Barney, upgraded shares in the world’s leading internet auctioneer to “buy” from “hold”, saying eBay’s latest results were pointing to sustainable growth.Shares in eBay rose 4.4 per cent to $43.61, while Google added 1.3 per cent to $291.61. Meanwhile, Yahoo lost earlier gains from the session, and ended the day flat at $33.33.Energy stocks saw buying as oil prices rose to $61.76 a barrel, triggering hopes for increased profits in the sector, which has already had a strong year so far.The oil price spike followed the death of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter of oil. Shares in ExxonMobil, the Dow component, rose 0.8 per cent to $59.23 while Kerr-McGee put on 1.7 per cent to $81.53.In the broader market, technology outperformed blue-chips. By the close, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,235.35 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,623.15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent to 2,195.38.A widely watched gauge of industrial activity registered its highest level so far this year, fanning hopes that the manufacturing slowdown earlier this year would prove shortlived. The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index rose to 56.6 in July from 53.8 in June.Among companies reporting on Monday was Dow component Procter & Gamble. The household goods conglomerate said its fiscal fourth-quarter net profit exceeded forecasts with a 9 per cent rise. P&G’s health and family division, which includes the Pampers brand, saw sales growth of 13 per cent. However, tepid guidance sent Procter’s shares down 0.6 per cent to $55.32.Wal-Mart, which sells most of Procter’s wares, saw shares advance 0.4 per cent to $49.53 as it reported monthly sales growth at the higher end of its estimates.RadioShack jumped 14.1 per cent to $26.78 after it announced a 10-year
agreement to sell Cingular Wireless’ cellular phone services. Verizon Communications, whose wireless division used to have RadioShack as an outlet, saw shares ease 0.7 per cent to $33.98. Humana, the health insurer, announced its full-year 2006 earnings would increase by at least 26 per cent, but was a little more cautious about the current year as it reported earnings in line with expectations. The stock was up 7.0 per cent to $42.62.Tyson Foods, the meat processor, saw its shares fall after second-quarter profits missed expectations after settlement costs associated with lawsuits from pork farmers. The shares dropped 3.7 per cent to $17.95."
150;TSN;Tyson Foods;2005-08-01T20:15:55Z;Tyson warns on market conditions as profits fall;;Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor, blamed a 19 per cent drop in quarterly profits on weak results from its beef and pork segments and warned that difficult market conditions were likely to continue in the short term.The Springdale, Arkansas-based company reported a profit of $131m, or 36 cents a share in the fiscal third-quarter ended July 2, compared with $161m, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased by one per cent to $6.7bn.The 2005 quarter included charges related to the settlement with the hog farmers, who sued after Tyson restructured its hog operations in 2002, ending relationships with about 130 contract producers. The results also reflected the costs related to poultry plant closings.While Tyson said demand for chicken remained strong during the quarter and volume increased by 1.4 per cent, sales declined by 1.2 per cent due to slightly lower averege selling prices.Despite the declinining price, Tyson managed to improve its margin significantly, in part because of reduced grain costs and improved operating efficiencies.In contrast, Tyson said the beef market remained difficult during the quarter with selling prices under pressure. The company predicted that market conditions would remain tough for both beef and pork during the fiscal fourth quarter, but would improve after that.
151;TSN;Tyson Foods;2005-07-18T09:49:07Z;RFID tag roll-out hits resistance;;Technology to replace barcodes with radio-sensitive identity tags is being hampered by widespread scepticism among suppliers, according to Wal-Mart and other leading users.The development of radio frequency identification (RFID) was billed as one of the biggest leaps forward in the global logistics industry allowing retailers and their suppliers to track goods precisely throughout the supply chain.But a lack of enthusiasm among companies which have been forced to ship products containing the RFID tags is delaying its wider adoption and frustrating attempts to iron out technical snags.Wal-Mart, which was the first large retailer to require the use of RFID tags, says it is still struggling to persuade many of its main suppliers that the technology will benefit them as well as the retailers.Linda Dillman, Wal-Mart's chief information officer, said that about half of the suppliers still saw the use of RFID labels in shipments as a matter of “compliance”, rather than a benefit to their own operations.The problem was confirmed by a number of suppliers who voiced concerns about the cost of the technology at an industry conference in New York last week.“There are a lot of people who are dragging their feet and there are a lot of people who think they are wasting money,” said Gary Cooper, chief technology officer at Tyson Foods, the world's largest butcher.“I have not found anyone yet who has managed to make a return at the current tag costs.”Most commentators argue such worries are only natural at this stage and that suppliers will find efficiency savings to offset their costs once they fully implement the technology.Ms Dillman says that the one of the main challenges currently facing Wal-Mart is the positioning of RFID tags on cases, an issue that requires the active engagement of suppliers in the process.While RFID scanners provide greater flexibility than line-of-site bar code scanners, the transmission of data by the tags can be affected by the immediate proximity of water or metal, meaning shippers need to take great care with their placement of tags.
152;TSN;Tyson Foods;2005-05-23T19:15:35Z;Wal-Mart heirs unveil art gallery design;;The heirs of Sam Walton, the man who built Wal-Mart, on Monday unveiled their plans for a striking new art gallery complex that reflects their gradual emergence alongside the Carnegies, Gettys and Fords as a new force in American philanthropy.The new Crystal Bridges museum of American art is designed by Moshe Safdie, the Canadian-Israeli architect whose previous work includes the recently opened Yad Vashem holocaust museum in Jerusalem. It will be built within walking distance of the main square of Bentonville, Arkansas, home town of the world's largest retailer.“We're seeing a region that became powerful economically, and that is now ambitious for creating a cultural life for itself,” said Mr Safdie, who said his vision was influenced by his design for the Skirball Arts Centre in Los Angeles, which combines galleries with performance and educational facilities.The museum, funded by the Walton Family Foundation and expected to cost above $50m, will house works by Winslow Homer, Norman Rockwell, Marsden Hartley and other American artists that have been steadily acquired for the foundation by Alice Walton, Sam's daughter, over the past 15 years.Ms Walton, one of four Walton children, created a stir in the art world last month when she paid more than $35m at Sotheby's in New York for “Kindred Spirits”, an 1849 painting by Asher Durand, a member of the Hudson Valley School. The Walton bid beat a joint offer from New York's Metropolitan Museum and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.Ms Walton has taken a leading role in efforts to develop northwest Arkansas, which is also home to Tyson Foods and the JB Hunt trucking business, including successfully lobbying for a local airport with links to several big US cities.She described the new museum on Monday as “a wonderful way to build appreciation for America's artistic heritage, and create cultural opportunities here in northwest Arkansas”.The museum says it expects to receive around 250,000 visitors a year, in an architecturally uninspiring town whose current main tourist attraction is a visitors' centre in Sam Walton's old store on the main square.Mr Safdie's design envisages the creation of two pools in a ravine located in around 100 acres of woodland donated by the Walton family. It will include two buildings spanning the pools, and a series of other structures built into the sides of the ravine, using a mixture of laminated wood and glass.The museum's activities will include a special focus on teaching activities for school children, reflecting the principle focus of grant giving by the Walton foundation on reform of the US school system.
153;TSN;Tyson Foods;2004-11-18T21:38:48Z;Wall Street stocks take a breather;;"Wall Street finished an uninspiring session marginally higher on Thursday as technology shares shrugged off a cautious outlook from Applied Materials and the broader market flirted with extending recent gains.By the close the S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent up at 1,183.56. The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the largest of the companies targeted.Elsewhere on the corporate news front, the shares of Applied Materials were 1.8 per cent higher at $17.65 after the chipmaker announced its best financial year since 2000 but warned that momentum was likely to peter out.Meanwhile Intel begged to differ as its chief executive officer said he saw ""improved performance"" for the first half of the next year. Shares put on 2 per cent to $24.80.News of a possible mad-cow disease case sent McDonald's shares 1.5 per cent lower to $29.95, alongside Tyson Foods, a beef processing company, which gave up 1.7 per cent to $16.63.The fallout from the global withdrawal of Merck's Vioxx drug threatened to spread to other drugs groups as a regulatory official told lawmakers in Congress other similar drugs needed to be monitored. The NYSE-listed shares of AstraZeneca fell 8.6 per cent to $40.34 while GlaxoSmithKline's US-listed shares lost 3.22. Merck's stock saw limited action while Pfizer's was fractionally lower.Genesco was one of a latest batch of retailers this week to report quarterly results and saw shares put on 9.8 per cent to $29.36, in one of the best showings at the New York Stock Exchange after the company said its Johnston & Murphy shoe brand helped it walk to higher profits and increase its outlook for the year.However, Claire's Stores sounded a less sanguine note for the upcoming quarter and saw shares put one of the worst performances at the Big Board, down 15.7 per cent to $22.45.Williams-Sonoma fared equally badly, down 6 per cent to $36.77 after the retailer of high-end houseware guided investors lower for the fourth quarter after it missed estimates with its results for the current quarter.Kmart shares staged a retreat after a sharp rally in the previous session when the company's $11bn merger with Sears was announced. Sears was 1.5 per cent up to $53.80 and Kmart gave up 4.9 per cent to $103.71.After the closing bell, investors will also get quarterly results from Gap, another clothing retailer. Gap shares were down 2 per cent to $22.54.The shares of Medtronic, the medical device maker, were 7 per cent lower at $48.65 after the company guided analysts towards the lower end of its range for third-quarter profits.Meanwhile Multimedia Games shares rebounded 5.4 per cent to $13.14 from sharp earlier falls after the casino games maker reported a 3 per cent decrease in profits.Salesforce.com, one of the most eagerly anticipated initial public offerings earlier this year, saw shares decline 14.5 per cent to $17.82 amid disappointment at the guidance given by the company after the Wednesday close. The news prompted a downgrade to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" by Credit Suisse First Boston.On a more upbeat note, the shares of Netflix rose 14 per cent to $11.92 after the internet DVD rental company increased its forecasts for revenues and subscriber growth in the fourth quarter."
154;TSN;Tyson Foods;2004-11-15T21:35:33Z;Wall St starts week cautiously despite oil decline;;US stocks began the week cautiously as a falling crude oil price was countered by heightened worries the market was overextended after three consecutive weeks of gains.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 10,550.24 while the broader S&P 500 index was flat at 1,183.83. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.2 per cent at 2,094.09.Stocks faced resistance even as crude oil futures declined to below $47 per barrel amid continued expectations of rising reserves.The S&P 500 and the Dow have tacked on three consecutive weeks of gains and stood at three-year and seven month highs, respectively, by Friday's close. But some analysts warn that the gains are disproportionate in the face of the uncertainties remaining in the US economy. While bulls are seen as still in charge, slowly dwindling trading volumes suggest the current rally may run out of steam before Christmas. On Monday about 1.5bn shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange, but traders said they would like to see volume closer to the 1.8bn shares that traded at the onset of the current rally.David Rosenberg, chief North America economist at Merrill Lynch, dismissed any pessimism about the outlook for stocks and gave no less than 10 reasons to be bullish. They include the interest rate and bond market outlook, declining oil prices and the economy, as well as the upcoming holiday shopping season and the declining dollar.He did acknowledge the dollar could become a threat if its decline warranted increases in interest rates that would in turn choke the rebound of the economy.Shares in Microsoft reversed a steep decline in pre-market trading and rose 1.9 per cent to $27.39 by the close on the day the world's biggest software company was distributing a much-heralded $30bn dividend.Microsoft shares did not see the typical decline associated with stocks going ex-dividend and confounded expectations that such a retreat could weigh on the broader technology sector. However, the see-sawing trade on Monday failed to vindicate the view of other market participants who had predicted a broad rally after investors would reinvest the $30bn back in the stock market.Among companies due to report earnings this week, Lowe's said it achieved a 15 per cent rise in third-quarter profits. Shares in the second-biggest home improvement retailer in the US edged off 1.7 per cent to $59.25.Home Depot, a rival, saw shares add 1.3 per cent to $43.79 in afternoon exchanges. It reports earnings on Tuesday. The two retailers are also seen as indicators of the strength of the housing market because they provide a wide range of home improvement goods and services that respond to housing market trends.Also among retailers, Family Dollar shares rose 2.8 per cent to $32.14 while Staples shares added 2.3 per cent to $31.10 after Barron's, the weekly investment newspaper, gave an upbeat review of the two stocks.In the online retail sector, the shares of Overstock.com lost 4.8 per cent to $57.30 after the company announced the sale of 1m shares to finance its capital expenditure needs. Such transactions are seen as dilutive of the value of existing stock.Northeast Utilities sounded a cautious note as it cut its earnings forecast for next year, citing difficulty in securing some wholesale contracts. Its shares lost 10 per cent to $18.01.In merger-and-acquisition news, the shares of SPX rose 2.8 per cent to $44.21 on reports it is close to concluding a deal with General Electric to sell its fire and security unit to the conglomerate. GE shares lost 0.4 per cent to $36.10.WM Wrigley, which makes chewing gum, was reported to be close to buying the Life Savers and Altoids brands from Kraft Foods, whose shares eased 0.6 per cent to $34.68. Wrigley's shares inched up 1.1 per cent to $68.08.In the media sector, shares in Marketwatch rose 7.9 per cent to $18.02 after news that the financial news group would be taken over by Dow Jones. The latter's shares edged off 0.2 per cent to $45.10.Among pharmaceuticals, Perrigo shares lost 1.6 per cent to $18.36 after the maker of generic drugs agreed to buy an Israeli company for $818m.Tyson Foods saw shares rise 1.2 per cent to $17.08 even after the meat processing company reported a decline in quarterly earnings. The results exceeded analyst forecasts.
155;TSN;Tyson Foods;2004-11-15T16:22:34Z;Tyson’s fourth quarter profits plummet;;Fourth quarter profits at Tyson Foods took a beating on Monday as high cattle prices and a US beef export ban hit the meat processor’s beef business but the company’s shares rose as its numbers still beat analysts’ expectations.The world’s largest processor of beef, chicken and pork reported a 55 per cent fall in diluted earnings per share to 19 cents, or net income of $66m, compared to 42 cents, or $147m, a year ago. Fourth quarter sales were $7.1bn compared to $6.6bn for the same period last year.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 16 cents a share.The results were hurt by hedging losses, rising grain prices and expenses related to closing some plants.But they were partially helped by a strong performance at Tyson’s core chicken business, where full year operating margin more than tripled from last year to 6.5 per cent. Chicken sales rose by 20 per cent in the fourth quarter over the same period. Pork sales rose by 37.2 per, followed by chicken sales. Beef sales fell 4.1 per cent.Arkansas-based Tyson in August warned that it would face lower earnings than expected, blaming poor hedging results and weaker demand for chicken and beef.Dick Bond, Tyson president, said margins would “continue to be difficult” in beef until international markets re-opened to US beef and live cattle were allowed to be shipped from Canada.Tyson forecast fiscal year 2005 earnings of $1.15-$1.45, compared with $1.13 for this fiscal year.Asked what accounted for the 30 cent difference in the range, Mr Bond said: “The beef and the whole beef segment is one major factor that would be cause for that swing. And that is not just dependent upon when export markets open and when Canada opens. We do need, as a company and an industry, to get back to a higher capacity utilization to get back to a reasonable cost structure.”Although there are signs that the “low carb” diet craze has abated, Tyson was still benefiting from it because it had instilled in consumers more awareness of a need to eat protein-rich foods such as chicken and beef.John Tyson, chief executive, said: “At the breakfast meal, you got a lot more permission that it’s okay to go ahead and have ham or bacon or chicken sausage where, before, you were supposed to have your yoghurt and fruit plate. So, the permission that is left from the low carb diet will still be a positive for the protein industry.”Tyson shares closed up 1 per cent at $17.

Surprisingly, he was the first ever guest from continental Europe for the livery company, which has been around for three decades. Not very cordiale, mes copains! Diary wonders whether Dumont was invited because he came with cases of Cuvee Rose Brut, which is only released with the L-P chairman’s approval. Delicious. Perhaps the WCoM can ensure a regular supply from its newest member: Tim Mason, marketing director of Tesco.- Disney’s lame duck - ABC, not Donald - finally gets a primetime banker in Desperate Housewives. You’d think advertisers would lap it up? Er, no. American brands Tyson Foods, ConAgra and Lowe’s Home Improvements all took out ads in the first episode. They have pulled back since, after being lobbied by socially conservative activists who hate the comedy drama’s disrespectful take on suburbia. It’s the latest successful action against TV advertisers by groups such as the American Family Association. C4 has bought Desperate Housewives and another ABC hit, Lost.So we’ll get to see what the fuss is about here soon enough. However, if Diary had to judge on spec between randy housewives and ConAgra, makers of something called the Banquet Pot Pie, we know which we’d find the more wholesome.- Diary was asked by the Newspaper Society to cast a wise and worldly eye over the nation’s local papers. We know: we thought they must have the wrong people, too. But they did throw in a free lunch.As the soul of discretion, we couldn’t possibly reveal which of the nation’s Guardians, Advertisers and Extras will carry off the gongs. We confess to puzzlement, however, about the entry which proudly claimed to be “another dog-crusher”. We assume this is a reference to the paper’s Nicholas Soames-like physique, but we wouldn’t swear by it.- Channel 4 wants its digital channels, E4 and More4, classified as public service TV. Independent producers know this would mean C4 would not have to pay them extra for rights to show programmes on the digital channels. Ofcom’s usual support for C4 is only outdone by its endorsement of the indies. Which side will it back?- Marketing, marketing, marketing.It’s all anyone talks about when a new CEO picks up speed. Unless, he’s a marketer. Robert Polet, ex-Unilever ice-cream man turned group CEO of Gucci, home of fashionista Stella McCartney (pictured), sacked Giacomo Santucci, chief exec of the Gucci brand, last week. Polet, who took over this summer, sounded keener on masochism than marketing: “I can’t expect anything but total loyalty, commitment and dedication from the CEOs and top managers.” Funny, because McCartney doesn’t do leather.
157;TSN;Tyson Foods;2004-08-27T20:47:12Z;Wall St slows to a crawl as convention looms;;Like a ghost train in a rainy night, Wall Street stocks moved ahead this week but hardly anyone was there to see it happen.Trading volumes were positively torpid and reached new lows for the year at the New York Stock Exchange during the week. “We'll need a cattle prod to reach 1bn shares today,” said one trader yesterday, and his view was vindicated when 847m shares exchanged hands at the Big Board.While a few stocks received some attention, the broader market edged modestly higher.By Friday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,195.01, or 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,107.77 on Friday and was 0.9 per cent higher for the week. The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.5 per cent to 1,862.08, for a weekly showing of 1.3 per cent to the upside.Many market watchers said the torpor was set to continue and worsen next week, when the Republican party holds its quadrennial national convention in New York's Madison Square Garden arena, above the railway station where trains from Long Island and New Jersey bring many Wall Streeters to work.The combined fears about a more tedious commute than usual and possible terrorist incidents have caused even the most workaholic traders to book time off. There were wide expectations for Wall Street to become a ghost town setting as early as lunchtime Friday.The effects of the market-wide languor were felt in the relatively tepid reaction from the stock market to the retreat in oil prices. Having flirted with a $50 price for a barrel of crude, futures begun a decline last Friday that continued this week. By the close of trade on Friday, they stood at $43.18.Nevertheless, concerns that US shoppers might not be as loose with their wallets in the near future were reiterated by some companies even as lower petrol prices gave some cause for optimism.Wal-Mart saw its shares fall by 1.9 percent for the week after it trimmed its August forecast on Monday for sales at stores open at least a year, saying that back-to-school activity had not lived up to expectations.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shares ended Thursday 10.4 per cent lower but were only 1.9 per cent lower for the week after the purveyor of sugary treats announced a 56 per cent drop in profits, missing forecasts and withdrawing its quarterly and full-year earnings guidance.Likewise, Starbucks shares fell 6.5 per cent on Thursday and were 5.3 per cent lower for the week after disappointing sales figures from the coffee shop operator.Fred's, the discount retailer, saw shares lose 10.9 per cent the same day and 12.6 per cent for the week as it released lower quarterly earnings.However, Target, another discount retailer, sounded a different note from rival Wal-Mart when it reaffirmed its August same-store sales guidance on Tuesday, sending shares 1.4 per cent higher for the session and 2.5 per cent higher for the week.Williams-Sonoma, a retailer of high-end corkscrews and other housewares, said on Wednesday profits rose 55 per cent in the quarter. Shares gained 9 per cent this week.Even if some US consumers might be loath to consume as much, they appeared to still be buying food. HJ Heinz, the company best known for its tomato ketchup, announced a 7.8 per cent rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, and the news sent shares 2.8 per cent higher, for a weekly gain of 3 per cent. The company said brisk sales of its low carb frozen foods helped the results.In a sign that not all foods are equal, poultry producers came under pressure this week when Sanderson Farms on Tuesday said profits missed analyst estimates. Shares fell 18 per cent for the week, along with those of Pilgrim's Pride, which gave up 16 per cent that days but were only 2.8 per cent lower for the week, and Tyson Foods, which fell 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent for the week.Some deal-making also broke the August lull. Toronto-Dominion Bank shares eased 2.4 per cent on Thursday after it announced the purchase of a controlling state in Banknorth, a Maine bank whose shares added 10 per cent on the news a day earlier.BlackRock shares rose 2.4 per cent on the same day and were 10.4 per cent for the week after it announced the $375m purchase of SSRM Holdings, the holding company of State Street Research & Management, from MetLife. The insurer's shares were flat for the week.

The Nasdaq Composite index off 0.1 per cent at 1,836.84.Crude futures declined for the third consecutive day after rising to within a whisker of $50 per barrel last week, when the International Energy Agency ruled out the use of strategic oil reserves by leading industrial countries to tame crude prices.If the oil price stays lower, the Federal Reserve's view that its high level was temporary will have been vindicated. Some officials from the US central bank appeared on television on Monday, reiterating the Fed's optimism about the economic recovery.Trading volumes barely reach 1.1bn shares by the close on the New York Stock Exchange in a stark reminder that most traders and investors have opted to leave town ahead of the convention.Retail stocks continued to be in focus a day after Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, disappointed the market by trimming its August same-store sales guidance. Shares in Wal-Mart inched up 0.1 per cent to $53.86.Target, a rival, reaffirmed its guidance for August same-store sales, pointing at a mixed picture for the sector amid widespread fears that the American consumer could stop supporting the economy at a time when investment has not yet picked up the slack. Target shares added 1.4 per cent to $44.33.A report from Redbook Research said August chain store sales rose 1 per cent in the week ended on August 21 but the impact of hurricanes was being felt in the sector.Perry Ellis shares jumped 5.7 per cent to $21.90 after the clothing designer and retailer narrowed its quarterly loss.Also among clothing retailers, Gap saw its shares lose 1.4 per cent to $19.95 after the FT reported the group was looking to resume its international expansion plans and had considered opening a fourth chain of stores in the US.In the bio-sciences sector, Delta Pine and Land announced the acquisition from Syngenta of licences to develop biotechnology products.

159;TSN;Tyson Foods;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
