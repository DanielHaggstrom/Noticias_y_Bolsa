0;VAR;Varian Medical Systems;2012-10-26T20:36:42Z;Expedia leads US travel groups higher;;Expedia soared on Friday after solid quarterly earnings following market close on Thursday beat analysts’ expectations.The online travel company also raised its full-year earnings outlook, saying acceleration in a technology-enhanced hotel business had driven profits in the third quarter.Expedia shares jumped 15.2 per cent to $59.06, accounting for most of the week’s 13.4 per cent gain. The stock has now nearly doubled its market value since the beginning of the year.Smaller rival Priceline also rose, up 3.9 per cent to $579.46. The company is due to report its quarterly results in early November. The stock has gained 3.4 per cent over the past five days.Overall, US equities had a volatile session trading in and out of negative territory for most of the session. Main indices closed mixed on Friday but still registered weekly losses.Earlier, GDP figures came in better than expected. The US economy grew at an annualised 2 per cent in the third quarter as stronger spending by consumers and the government offset falling exports and flat business investment.However, investors focused on earnings releases, as 157 companies reported quarterly profits during the week.Tom Digenan, head of US core and value equities at UBS, said the markets reflected the fact that investors were really paying attention to earnings.“Companies may have earned about $100 per share on the S&P 500, but mostly they have lowered guidance. If companies can’t grow their top line with the 2 per cent GDP, imagine what will happen with a slower or negative economic growth,” Mr Digenan said.“We have seen that corporations changed behaviour, anticipating the fiscal cliff scenario, but it will be more dangerous if consumers change their behaviour and pull back their spending during the crucial holiday season,” he added.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower to 1,411.94, with the financial sector hardest hit. The index lost 1.5 per cent over the week.Citigroup shares fell 2.2 per cent to $36.60, after news that the bank was fined $2m by Massachusetts’ securities regulator. The watchdog said that a senior analyst’s pre-IPO view on Facebook was improperly shared with TechCrunch by a junior analyst. Both analysts are no longer with the company.Bank of America lost 1.3 per cent to $9.12 while JPMorgan Chase fell 1.2 per cent to $41.16.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed fractionally higher at 2,987.95 but finished the week 0.6 per cent lower.Apple shares recouped some of the heavy losses earlier and closed 0.9 per cent lower to $604, continuing their slide after disappointing results on Thursday. The most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 1 per cent over the week.Amazon, which also disappointed investors after reporting its first quarterly loss since 2003 on Thursday, jumped later in the session to close 6.9 per cent higher to $238.24, rebounding from the previous session’s losses. Friday’s rally helped narrow weekly losses to 0.7 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 13,107.21. In other earnings news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber reported a drop in net income on lower total revenues, missing analysts’ expectations. The company said it expected fourth-quarter tyre volume to drop 3 to 5 per cent from a year earlier. The shares were hit hard, falling 10.4 per cent to $11.02 amid high volume.Moody’s reported a 41 per cent jump in profits for the third quarter, with earnings per share beating analysts’ expectations by far. The rating agency benefited from increased debt issuance business as companies rushed to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Shares in the company rose 4.8 per cent to $47.89, making up most of the 5 per cent weekly gain.Another high riser was Varian Medical Systems, which soared 15.2 per cent to $66.93. The medical equipment manufacturer beat estimates for its third-quarter revenue and profits. The company’s weekly gain was 14.6 per cent.KKR reported strong growth in third-quarter earnings, but said it had raised only $700m for the fund since February. Shares in the buyout firm rose initially, but fell 0.7 per cent to $14.74 and were 2.1 per cent lower on the week.Merck closed down 0.3 per cent to $46.15 after the drugmaker reported its quarterly results. Although the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance for the year, its quarterly earnings came in above expectations. The stock has lost 1.9 per cent over the week.VeriSign shares fell sharply after lacklustre third-quarter results. The company, which registers domain names on the internet, is being investigated by the US departments of commerce and justice for its domain pricing terms. Shares in the company fell 15.5 per cent to $39.39 making up most of the 16.8 per cent weekly loss.
1;VAR;Varian Medical Systems;2011-11-15T22:15:10Z;Hopes for a new Italian government drive Wall Street;Strong retail data limit losses;"A flurry of positive economic data edged US stocks into positive territory on Tuesday, before traders seized on good news from Europe to give the rally momentum during the afternoon.Jacobs Engineering and Varian Medical Systems were the star performers in the S&P 500.Jacobs jumped 7.9 per cent to $41.17 after the construction group said it had ended the third quarter with a backlog of orders totalling $14.3bn. Varian was up 6.2 per cent to $60.60 after JPMorgan analysts told clients the German conglomerate Siemens would exit radiation therapy treatments, allowing Varian to gain market share.The S&P 500 finished the day at 1,257.81, on solid gains of 0.5 per cent. Trading had been volatile until midday when news that Italian prime minister-designate Mario Monti may form a government as soon as Wednesday triggered a decisive rally.“US markets have been given a reprieve for now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But that could be reversed in a second if there is bad news from Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 1,257.81.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.1 per cent to 2,686.2, with support from Apple, by far its most heavily weighted stock.Apple shares rose 2.5 per cent to $388.83 after ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told clients he expected the company to initiate a dividend policy next year. Apple has not paid a dividend since 1995, according to Bloomberg data.Retail sales figures rose 0.5 per cent month on month in October, but that was not enough to stop
a host of bellwether retail names falling on results releases.Walmart was off 2.4 per cent to $57.46 despite reporting US sales growth for the first time in nine quarters.Sales were driven by discounting that hurt margins, driving profit 3 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2010 to $3.3bn.“Walmart investors have become accustomed to earnings beats,” said David Shick, head of consumer research at Stifel Nicolaus. “But the company is correct to focus on expanding market share at the expense of the bottom line in the short term.”Walmart’s size and exposure to thrifty consumers have made it a favourite of defensive investors this year and it remains one of the best performers in the S&P 500.Urban Outfitters fell sharply in early trading, before riding the afternoon rally, to end the day up 0.1 per cent to $26.85. Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Barclays Capital analysts noted, however, that in local currency terms revenue was up 7 per cent year on year.Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $38.07 despite beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of 60 cents. Sears Holdings dropped 3.1 per cent to $70.03 after its Canadian namesake – in which it holds a 90 per cent stake – posted a loss of C$45.8m.The focus on retailers took the heat off bank stocks with the financial sector of the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 per cent, despite another sharp rise in the yields of Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $28.02 on reports that a host of hedge fund investors, including John Paulson, had cut their stakes in the bank during the third quarter.High-profile investor flight also hurt professional networking website LinkedIn, which slipped 4.8 per cent to $74.86, on news Bain Capital will sell its entire stake of 3.71m shares, when the newly floated company’s lock-out period ends.PepsiCo was boosted by news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a $146m stake. The stock was up 2.7 per cent to $64.50 on hopes that Mr Peltz will push the board to boost shareholder returns.Quanta Services climbed 2.2 per cent to $19.19, on renewed hope that the Keystone XL pipeline, for which Quanta has a lucrative service contract, will be given the go-ahead if the state of Nebraska’s environmental concerns can be addressed.The hard drive manufacturer Western Digital Corporation slipped 4.9 per cent to $25.05 as the open-ended impact of widespread flooding in Thailand on its factories led another analyst to downgrade the stock."
2;VAR;Varian Medical Systems;2009-07-27T20:31:07Z;Late rally lifts Wall Street;;US equities posted small gains on Monday, as investors digested a mixed array of earnings results that overshadowed better news on the housing front.In New York, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 982.18 and closed at a fresh eight month peak.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 1,967.89, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 9,108.51, with Verizon’s latest earnings weighing on sentiment.After the closing bell, Amgen provided some earnings cheer, as its second quarter earnings beat estimates and shares of the biotech company jumped in afterhours trade.The S&P 500 reached its high for the day, at 982.49, after reports that new home sales in June rose 11 per cent from May and inventories of unsold homes dropped to their lowest level since February 1998.While median home prices dropped 12 per cent over the past year, the data provided further evidence that the housing market may have bottomed said economists. The S&P home builders index rose 5.7 per cent.Among the 10 main S&P industry sectors, financials rose 1.5 per cent with information technology lagging by 0.3 per cent.Equity volatility edged up with the S&P Vix (volatility index) trading above 24, after touching a low of 23 last week.Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos believes a normal range for Vix, is between 18 and 22. He said there is still a risk that the S&P 500 could drop back to 825.In the past two weeks, the S&P has risen about 11 per cent beyond 950, the level that had capped stocks since the end of May.Traders believe that the benchmark is on course to reach 1,000, a level not attained since last November. In recent weeks, banks have been raising their year-end targets beyond 1,000 for the S&P.This week’s earnings results will determine whether equities can maintain their recent strong run, say analysts. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup said that while companies reporting earnings to date, some 40 per cent of the S&P 500, have beaten forecasts by about 11 per cent, the results are still down approximately 25 per cent compared with a year ago.“To be fair, margins have been resilient as corporate management teams have been very effective at delivering the bottom line,” he said.Mr Levkovich said that while some worry about the sustainability of growth, it is not an issue until the second quarter of next year and that latecomers to the market rally could miss out as “stock prices will not stand idly by as they generally trade in sync with earnings”.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management said: “With liquidity still supportive, high cash levels still waiting to be deployed and a less volatile environment, as well as improved earnings and a reasonable message from technical signals, the near-term environment appears favourable.”Earlier in earnings news, Honeywell reported a drop of 38 per cent for its second-quarter earnings and after an early fall, its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $34.24.The company’s revenue dropped more than a forecast $7.73bn, falling 22 per cent to $7.56bn versus $9.67bn for the same period a year ago.Shares in Verizon dropped 1.6 per cent to $31 after a 21 per cent drop in profits to $3.16bn.The telecoms group announced 8,000 job cuts, and revenue increased 11 per cent to $26.86bn, boosted by growth in wireless subscribers.Corning, the maker of liquid crystal glass, generated second-quarter earnings of $611m, which beat forecasts, but its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.50.Meanwhile, Radioshack, the electronics retailer, also beat estimates as it cut costs, but its shares dropped 6.6 per cent to $15.In deals, Agilent Technologies said it plans to buy Varian for $1.5bn in cash, or $52 a share. Agilent rose 1.8 per cent to $22.66. Varian surged 29.1 per cent to trade at $50.61.Shares in Mylan, the drug maker, fell 12.6 per cent to $12.10 as the company denied a newspaper report that its workers overrode government-mandated quality controls.
3;VAR;Varian Medical Systems;2006-01-12T18:33:44Z;Book review: Santa Clara and semiconductors;;"Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970
By Christopher Lécuyer
£25.95 HardbackJean Hoerni, a Swiss- French physicist working for a small Californian electronics company, made the most important innovation in the history of the semiconductor industry in early 1959.He invented the planar process, which made possible the manufacture of ultra-reliable transistors and diodes, the workhorses of the electronics industry, at low cost. The process opened the way for mass manufacture of the integrated circuit, the component that triggered and sustained the electronics revolution.The innovation helped save the company Mr Hoerni worked for, Fairchild Semiconductor, which was on the brink of losing a critical order through poor component reliability: its transistors failed if tapped with just a pencil. But Mr Hoerni felt unappreciated by Fairchild Semiconductor. Incredibly, its head of research and development, the now legendary Gordon Moore, was at that time sceptical about the future of integrated circuits.In 1961 he and some colleagues left to establish a new semiconductor operation in Mountain View, California, in a move that would be copied many times as the physicists and engineers who had created Fairchild Semiconductor departed in disillusionment to seed the Santa Clara valley – Silicon Valley – with semiconductor start-ups.The Fairchild story is one of the more significant elements in the history of the rise of the Valley, a history that Christophe Lécuyer recounts with precision and painstaking scholarship, appending no less than 60 pages of notes.He explains how the Valley, an industrial backwater in the 1920s and 1930s, employing a few hundred machinists and engineers, became, by the 1970s, a leading industrial centre with a workforce of more than 58,000. He traces the history of a number of the significant companies, among them the microwave tube makers Varian Associates and Litton Industries and the chip companies Fairchild and Intel, to underline his conclusions.Lécuyer acknowledges the views of the historians Stuart Leslie, who argues that electronics in the Valley grew out of Stanford University’s research programmes, and AnnaLee Saxenian, who attributes more importance to the area’s decentralised industrial structure. But he holds that the unique manufacturing skills developed by entrepreneurs and innovators played at least as important a role in establishing the industrial cluster.The rise of Silicon Valley essentially falls into two parts: the first from the 1920s through to the 1950s, dominated by power tube manufacturers such as Eitel-McCullough and Litton Engineering. These were founded by men with deep local roots; many, like the Varian brothers who created Varian Associates, had powerful social consciences and founded egalitarian companies. The bulky, costly vacuum tube largely gave way to the transistor in the 1950s but the expertise in precision engineering that the tube companies had built up enabled many to switch to making semiconductor fabrication equipment.The second part of the story begins with the establishment of the electronics groups Hewlett-Packard and Shockley Semiconductor in the Valley. William Shockley, a great physicist, was difficult to work with and the talented individuals he recruited left en masse to establish Fairchild.A number of innovations encouraged the growth of the Valley cluster. It included a fear of unionisation that led companies to introduce stock options for all staff as opposed to top managers only, ready sources of venture capital for would-be start-ups, a social network of companies and individuals that meant manufacturing “know-how” quickly passed from company to company, and a fundamentally new ethos. The Valley’s original entrepreneurs built companies to last: the new breed built them to exploit the latest technology with a view to a public offering within five years and making a fortune.Telling the story through multiple company histories sometimes leads to confusing repetition; the author’s interest in technology means the book often reads more like manufacturing history than business analysis (does the reader need to know so much about klystrons and magnetrons?). And in an industry with more than its share of colourful characters, he hardly touches on individual personalities. An exception is his description of Robert Widlar, an engineer working for National Semiconductor. Widlar, he claims, drank, defied management, played destructive practical jokes and threatened colleagues with an axe. One sentence later, however, he is back to Widlar’s substantial skills in designing operational amplifiers.Lécuyer’s account concludes in the early 1970s, around the time Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were designing the Apple II, the first credible commercial personal computer.The ground had been prepared and all the pieces were in place for the next and even more spectacular advance."
