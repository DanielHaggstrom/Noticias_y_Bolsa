0;REG;Regency Centers Corp;2016-11-15T00:05:33Z;Regency Centers and Equity One announced $15.6bn merger;;Regency Centers and Equity One have announced a $15.6bn scrip merger the two companies say will create the largest REIT by equity value in the shopping centre index.The deal will create a portfolio of 429 primarily “grocery-anchored properties” across the US, with Equity One’s assets primarily located in metropolitan areas of Florida and Texas.Under the terms of the agreement, each Equity One share will be converted into 0.45 shares of newly issued Regency common stock, which will leave Equity One shareholders holding about 38 per cent of the newly-formed company, that will continue trading under the Regency banner.The combined entity is expected to have a pro forma market capitalisation of about $11.7bn, and a total market cap of $15.6bn. Management forecast realising $27m in annual run-rate savings by 2018, “primarily related to elimination of duplicative corporate and property-level operating costs”.Martin E. “Hap” Stein, Jr., Regency chief executive said in a statement:Shareholders of both companies are poised to benefit from an expanded presence in top metro areas, a higher organic growth profile, expanded development and redevelopment program, and greater tenant diversity.David Lukes, his opposite number at Equity One, said:The alignment of our respective portfolios, development/redevelopment pipelines, industry-leading operations, and access to a lower cost of capital, opens us to new avenues of growth that will benefit all shareholders.The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017.So far this year, Regency shares are up 2.6 per cent, marginally lagging the 2.7 per cent gain for Equity One over the same period.
1;REG;Regency Centers Corp;2014-10-17T22:18:47Z;Buyers line up for AmREIT shopping malls;Competing offers could value it well above the price at which it turned down a bid from Regency;Several prospective buyers are lining up final bids for AmREIT, in a deal that could value the US shopping mall landlord at as much as $26 a share.The Houston-based company put itself up for sale after receiving an unsolicited offer from Regency Centers in July. It has attracted interest from potential bidders including rival landlords Edens and Weingarten Realty as well as Regency, according to people familiar with the matter.The prices being offered in the final bidding round are likely to range between $25 and $26 a share, these people added. That would mark a premium of about 35 per cent over the value of AmREIT’s stock before it received Regency’s $22-a-share bid.The shares closed at $22.02 a share on Friday, giving the company a market value of $432.5m.According to one person familiar with the matter, other parties remain interested in the sale process, but details could not be established. Bids are expected by the end of the month.AmREIT, which specialises in owning large, open-air shopping malls anchored by grocery stores, hired Jefferies, the investment bank, to explore options in the wake of Regency’s offer.The landlord is viewed by rivals as having a high-quality portfolio and manages about 50 malls, 95 per cent of which are leased.Dealmaking in the global real estate market has risen in step with a wider rise in mergers and acquisitions this year, hitting $262bn in the year to date, up 14 per cent on 2013 levels, according to Thomson Reuters. The renewed activity comes after years of sluggish demand created by the financial crisis.M&A in the sector has been led by a string of deals between real estate investment trusts (Reits) – a corporate structure that affords landlords a lower tax rate, but for which they return 90 per cent of their income to investors.In August, the Financial Times reported that Gables Residential, the landlord of almost 40,000 family homes, had been put up for sale by its private equity owners in a sale likely to fetch about $3bn. News of that deal came just a month after Cobalt Capital Partners, the real estate company part-owned by insurance company USAA, was put up for sale with a price tag of about $1.8bn.AmREIT declined to comment. Regency and Weingarten declined to comment. Edens did not immediately respond to request for comment.
2;REG;Regency Centers Corp;2014-07-10T19:54:01Z;Regency bids $430m for smaller Reit;;Regency Centers has gone public with an unsolicited $430m offer for AmReit, a smaller real estate investment trust dealing primarily in retail, saying that its target had resisted its approach in private negotiations.Shares in AmReit rose more than 15 per cent in New York to $22.26, just above the $22-per-share offer. Regency’s stock was up 0.61 per cent at $55.73.Regency claimed that AmReit’s comparatively small size presented a “structural obstacle” in obtaining capital and shielding it from risk, and the proposed bid was in the best interest of AmReit investors.The price represents a 20 per cent premium to the average closing level of AmReit shares over the past month, Regency said, and would be payable in cash, stock or a combination of the two.Regency and AmReit both specialise in shopping centres, though Regency’s market capitalisation of $5.1bn is more than 10 times larger than AmReit’s. Regency chief executive Hap Stein said he was impressed with AmReit’s portfolio in malls anchored by grocery stores, Regency’s main area of focus.In announcing the proposal, Regency published a letter Mr Stein had sent to Kerr Taylor, AmReit’s founder who owns 5 per cent of the company. It said AmReit had declined to engage with its deal proposal.Mr Stein told the Financial Times that Regency had been seeking to negotiate a deal with AmReit for the past month.“We’ve just not been able to get them to engage in serious discussions,” he said.He added that Regency would consider offering a higher purchase price if AmReit could share information beyond what was available in its public filings, if that information showed additional value.Regency was looking, in particular, to establish the value of pending “densification” projects, such as if AmReit had been planning to invest in the construction of an office or apartment building on top of an existing grocery retail site.AmReit did not respond to a request for comment.Unsolicited acquisitions are uncommon among Reits, and Mr Taylor’s standing as founder, chairman and chief executive of AmReit may further his unwillingness to part with the company, said Jason White, a real estate analyst at Green Street Advisors.“There are other considerations besides the valuation that are at play,” Mr White said. “Founders may be less willing sellers than professional managers since, for many, the company has become part of their identity.”Reits receive beneficial tax status on the condition that they restrict any one person from owning more than 9.8 per cent of the company. This may be a disincentive to investors, explaining the rarity of hostile bids among Reits, Mr White said.Mr Stein believed AmReit’s portfolio and demographics represented a good “strategic fit” for Regency.“We view our proposal as shareholder friendly to both sets of shareholders,” he said.

However, the deal will also negatively impact the trust’s earnings and net asset backing.The trust said that in exchange for agreeing to the deal it had offered Regency Centers two options to increase its stake in the US portfolio from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.“Should Regency not take up this option, it is likely that Calpers will take up the full 75 per cent said Steven Sewell, chief executive of Macquarie CountrywideMr Sewell said the trust has started to see the real estate fundamentals deteriorate and he expects that trend to continue over the medium term.“Historically, grocery-anchored real estate in the US has been very strong from an income growth perspective. “For the first half of this year for the very first time in out history seeing property income growth going negative and that combined with cap rates moving has a compound negative affect on valuations,” he said.Following the sale, Macquarie Countrywide will be left with about 25 per cent of its assets in the US, 25 per cent in Europe and the balance in Australian and New Zealand.Macquarie Countrywide shares closed up 19 per cent at 61.5 Australian cents on Friday.
4;REG;Regency Centers Corp;2005-02-15T08:36:29Z;Macquarie acquires US malls in $2.79bn deal;;Macquarie CountryWide Trust is planning to jointly invest US$2.79bn in a shopping centre portfolio in the US, furthering a push by Australian real estate investment trusts into overseas markets.Sydney-based CountryWide and its Florida-based partner Regency Centers will buy a portfolio of 101 shopping centres from First Washington Investment and California Public Employees? Retirement System (Calpers) as well as two additional malls through a new joint venture.?This transaction will transform CountryWide into a significant global grocery-anchored retail trust,? CountryWide said.The deal follows a spate of similar acquisitions by Australian-based Reits of offshore assets, led by Sydney-listed Westfield Group, the world?s largest shopping mall operator.The dealmaking has been a result of the increasing maturity of the domestic market. UBS estimates about 60 per cent of Australia?s investment-grade property is owned by property trusts, compared with just 16 per cent in the UK and 3 per cent in continental Europe.Under the terms of the transaction, CountryWide will buy a 65 per cent indirect interest in the portfolio jointly held by First Washington and Calpers, and a 75 per cent indirect interest in the other two shopping centres, one of which is owned by Regency and the other by a third party. Regency will own the remaining share of the assets.CountryWide, an affiliate of Australia?s largest investment banking group, Macquarie, said it would raise A$843m through a renounceable rights issue as well as A$1.53bn in debt to finance its share of the deal.The properties are in 17 US states and the District of Columbia area. An average of 110,000 people live within a three-mile radius of each centre with an average annual household income of US$82,000, 30 per cent higher than the US national average, CountryWide said.James Inwood, an analyst with JPMorgan in Sydney, said the new portfolio was high quality but the price was also high with a relatively tight yield of 6.25 per cent.?In terms of the opportunities in a global context, you might argue there could be better ways for them to spend their capital,? he said.The transaction would also mean that CountryWide?s portfolio would now be 75 per cent offshore-based compared with about 40 per cent currently.The trust had previously commanded a premium because it was one of the few still offering investors majority exposure to the Australian domestic market, the analyst said.Aside from CountryWide, there were only two other significant trusts with majority exposure to the domestic market, Centro Properties Group and CFS Gandel Retail Trust.However Simon Jones, co-head of Macquarie?s property investment and management division, said the deal increased the group?s exposure to a premium sector. ?It?s in a market segment, food-based retail, which is the fastest growing,? Mr Jones said.The transaction will significantly increase the assets under management held by Macquarie Property, Australia?s second largest listed property trust manager, which are currently valued at A$16.5bn.
5;REG;Regency Centers Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
