0;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2019-05-23T18:15:56Z;US food and restaurant chains hit by rising pork prices;Chipotle shares among those affected as African swine fever prompts hog cull;A disease ravaging hog farms 11,000km away in China is affecting US restaurant chains and meat producers, leaving customers forking over higher prices for their pork.Hormel Foods, which produces Spam, said on Thursday that African swine fever in China drove up pork costs, weighing on its quarterly earnings and contributing to a cut in its full-year earnings and sales outlook.Meanwhile shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill came under pressure after analysts at BMO Capital Markets issued the equivalent of a sell rating for the stock, warning that surging pork prices will eat into the restaurant chain’s bottom line.Minnesota-based Hormel, whose brands also include Jenny-O Turkey and Justin’s peanut butter, reported record sales in its latest quarter but chief executive Jim Snee said: “As we look forward, the biggest unknown in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever in China.”African swine fever is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that affects both domestic and wild pigs. On its earnings call, Hormel pointed to industry information that showed China, the world’s largest pork producer and consumer, has lost 150m to 200m hogs, equivalent to more than the entire pork production in the US.Hog prices jumped nearly 20 per cent in China in the second quarter, and Hormel said it expects prices to continue to rise as cold storage stocks are drawn.The considerable decline in China’s pig population has driven US lean hog prices up 46 per cent since the start of the year, after declining 15 per cent in 2018.BMO analyst Andrew Strelzik said among the restaurants within his coverage, Chipotle is the most vulnerable to swings in pork prices. He forecast that Chipotle could begin to see the effect as early as the third quarter, and the impact “could be far greater” than current estimates.The bank downgraded Chipotle’s stock to underperform from market-perform and cut its price target to $620 from $675.“We believe the potential magnitude and duration of [African swine fever] impacts to margins is under-appreciated and [Chipotle] is among the restaurants most at risk,” Mr Strelzik wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle’s shares dropped 5.4 per cent to $667.33 in afternoon trading. The stock had been up more than 60 per cent year to date, thanks to a run of strong sales growth.Hormel shares fell 1.4 per cent to $38.94. Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin’ Brands, two other chains with notable pork exposure, tumbled 4.4 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively.Hormel’s Mr Snee also noted that trade wars were contributing to price pressure. “The key driver to the decline [in international sales] continues to be lower fresh pork exports volume and pricing caused by global trade uncertainty related to tariffs,” he said.
1;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Sanderson Farms results miss the mark as US meat glut grows;;Sanderson Farms saw sales and profit tumble in its fiscal third quarter as the poultry producer battles with low chicken prices, a domestic glut of beef and pork, and rising feed costs.The disappointing result, which failed to match market expectations, echoes the concerns of industry peers that have come under pressure from the effects of the US’s trade war with its allies and a surplus of meat.Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium products prompted the likes of China and Mexico to impose their own levies on US exports such as soyabeans and pork, as well as other products like motorcycles and bourbon.The tariffs have helped push down prices for some meats inside the US, which in turn has pressured margins for food producers.Joe Sanderson, the company’s chief executive, said in the company’s earnings statement the “significant counter-seasonal weakness” of the results was “due, at least in part, to a lack of chicken promotions at both food service and retail grocery stores and an ample supply of competing proteins.”The company said jumbo boneless breast meat prices were down almost 27 per cent from a year ago, while the average market price of bulk leg quarters was down 12 per cent and jumbo wing prices were down by 35.4 per cent.Recent data from the US Department of Agriculture showed domestic stockpiles of frozen red meat and poultry topped 2.5bn pounds in July for the second straight month, with volumes rising in recent months as the imposition of tariffs on US agricultural products by the likes of China and Mexico cause growing quantities of protein to go unsold.US stockpiles of chicken hit a record 888m pounds in June. And among stockpiles of red meat, those of pork ribs, veal and “other” red meat are at or near records this summer.Those forces prompted Tyson Foods last month to downgrade its earnings outlook and also contributed to Hormel Foods this morning to cut its sales guidance for the fiscal year.Mr Sanderson said: “The USDA expects chicken production growth of 2.3 per cent during calendar 2018, which alone shouldn’t be a burdensome supply number. However, chicken will continue to compete against an abundant domestic supply of protein, which may continue to pressure market prices.”In Sanderson’s third quarter ended July 31, net sales fell 9 per cent from a year ago to $852.4m. That was below the forecast among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for $865.7m.Net income of $11.5m, or 50 cents a share, tumbled from $115.8m a year ago, due in part to an 11 per cent jump in costs and expenses. Analysts forecast earnings of $1.75 a share.Sanderson also said feed costs had risen 1.5 cents a pound — or 5.8 per cent — from a year ago. Prices paid for corn and soyabean meal — primary feed ingredients — were up 4.3 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 2017.Sanderson shares were up 1.3 per cent in morning trade on Thursday, but had been down by more than 4 per cent during pre-market trade following the release of the results.
2;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2018-08-23T14:15:04Z;Hormel cuts sales outlook amid tariff woes, shares slip;;Investors soured on Hormel Foods on Thursday, after the meat and packaged food company revised down its net sales forecast as it contends with pressures on pork sales and potential tariff-related risks.Hormel, whose products include Spam, Jennie-O turkey, Hormel chicken and Skippy peanut butter, notched record net sales of $2.359bn in its third quarter ending July 29, just shy of average analyst estimates, and up 5 per cent year over year, but said organic net sales were flat.The company delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.39, up 15 per cent year over year, and mostly in line with analyst expectations.Hormel reaffirmed previous earnings per share guidance, but revised down its net sales outlook to $9.4bn to $9.6bn, compared with a previous forecast of $9.7bn to $10.1bn, noting it believes it will be able to mitigate the impacts of foreign trade uncertainty, increased freight costs and commodity market volatility.Refrigerated foods net sales rose 10 per cent, even though organic net sales were down 3 per cent on lower hog harvest volumes.Still the performance of the refrigerated food segment offset a dramatic decline in commodity profits, which fell 88 per cent under the weight of a double-digit increase in per-unit freight expenses and higher advertising spending.Hormel had ramped up advertising in the quarter, spending $40m on brands including Skippy peanut butter, Natural Choice deli meat, Jennie-O turkey, Applegate meats, Wholly Guacamole and Herdez salsas.Net sales in grocery products were flat, despite increased advertising.Jennie-O Turkey net sales rose 8 per cent, as consumer demand for whole bird, deli products and lean ground turkey delivered a boost. But profit for the segment declined amid double-digit increases in freight costs and increased advertising spending.International net sales were up 11 per cent, but organic net sales were down 3 per cent, as fresh pork export volume declined sharply due to the effect of increased tariffs in certain markets.Last week Hormel announced the sale of its Fremont processing facility to WholeStone Farms, which process 10,500 hogs per day, or a third of Hormel’s hog harvest volume, which the company noted as a strategic decision reflecting changes in the long term dynamics of the pork industry.A glut of low-priced beef and pork on the market has heaped pressure on Hormel and other meat producers, such as Tyson Foods and Sanderson Farms, as stockpiles of meat have accumulated and tariffs have contributed to some going unsold.Hormel shares, which were up 5.8 per cent year to date as of Wednesday’s close, were off by 3 per cent to $37.40.
3;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2018-04-06T14:59:04Z;Soft commodities slide again on beefed-up tariff threat;;Donald Trump’s plan to impose an additional $100bn in tariffs on imports from China is weighing on soft commodities and farm equipment makers.The move by the US president, announced via a White House statement on Thursday night, escalates the tit-for-tat trade battle between the two countries. China responded on Friday saying it was “not afraid to fight a trade war” and that it was prepared to adopt “comprehensive countermeasures.”Soft commodities have endured wild swings this week, suffering sharp intraday drops on Wednesday after China unveiled plans for tariffs on over 100 US products - although the likes of feeder cattle and lean hog futures recovered on the day thanks to a bout of short-covering.But concerns that Beijing could now further target US agricultural farm goods in retaliation prompted soyabean futures for May delivery to slide two-thirds of 1 per cent to $10.235 a bushel on Friday. Corn futures were down one-third of 1 per cent at $3.885 a pound. Live cattle futures were down 1.3 per cent while lean hogs were 0.1 per cent lower.Among US agricultural stocks, tractor maker Deere & Co was down 1.2 per cent, while Caterpillar was down 1.6 per cent. DowDuPont, which counts agrochemicals and seeds as businesses alongside its plastics and chemicals units, was off 1.1 per cent. Monsanto was up 0.3 per centFood producers were faring better, with many analysts surmising tariff action could depress soft commodity prices, thereby driving down the cost of inputs for such companies. Tyson Foods was up 1 per cent, Spam-maker Hormel gained 1.3 per cent and Pilgrim’s Pride, the US’s largest chick producer, was up 1.1 per cent.Among the commodity trading and food processing companies, Bunge was up 0.7 per cent and Archer Daniels Midlands added 0.1 per cent.The S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.1 per cent in mid-morning trade.
4;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2018-04-04T15:11:19Z;US meat producers rise with soyabeans under pressure;;The US-China trade beef is turning up the heat on the meat sector.After the two economies traded tit-for-tat tariff plans, US meat producers were trudging higher on a fall in the price of soyabeans, one of the grains used to fatten up livestock destined for slaughter (China has targeted US exports of the crop for potential retaliatory tariffs.)•Hormel shares are up 4.9 per cent to $35.91•Pilgrim’s Pride is up 2.5 per cent to $24.72•Tyson Foods shares up 2.24 per cent to $71.50•Sanderson Farms shares up 1.4 per cent to $119.30On the flip side, cattle futures were sliding lower as China took aim at US beef exports as well.CME live cattle futures were down 1.45 per cent to $110.35, briefly touching $110.10 earlier in the session, their lowest point since October, according to Thomson Reuters data.
5;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2018-04-02T17:11:19Z;China pork duties give US meat producers a roasting;;It’s not just technology stocks that are getting pummeled on Monday.Shares in leading US meat processors are also feeling the market’s ire, with investors fleeing the sector after China raised tariffs on imports of American pork products to 25 per cent in retaliation against President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs.Tyson Foods, the country’s biggest meat producer by market value, fell as much as 6.3 per cent to $68.56. The decline marks the stock’s biggest one-day drop in nearly 11 months and takes the shares to their lowest level in over six months.Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam, dropped 2.6 per cent to $33.43 while smaller players such as Pilgrim’s Pride and Sanderson Farms were down 1.4 per cent at $24.26 and 1.1 per cent to $117.73 respectively.Tim Ramey, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said in a report on Monday that in the medium term, it would be very difficult for meat producers to change the course of production meaningfully to adjust for external shocks such as the China tariffs.“We expect the Chinese tariff to cause meat supplies in the US to back up meaningfully as the market has to be cleared,” he said in the report.Alongside pork, Beijing also imposed or raised tariffs on 127 other US products — including a variety of fruits, nuts and wine — in a blow to American farmers given that China is the second-biggest customer for US agricultural exports after Canada.Commodities traders Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge also fell amid a broader markets sell off, with both companies shedding 2.2 per cent.(Photo: Reuters)
6;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2017-08-24T17:16:52Z;Pricey pork, beef take a bite out of Hormel earnings;;Hormel shares are suffering on Thursday after its latest round of earnings failed to bring home the proverbial bacon, as sky-high pork and beef prices prompted the maker of Spam, Jennie-O turkey and other packaged foods to cut its full-year earnings guidance.The Minnesota-based company — whose products also include Hormel meats and Skippy peanut butter — saw its shares crumble more than 6 per cent after earnings failed to meet analysts’ expectations. That puts them on track for their biggest one-day drop since May.For the quarter ending July 30, revenue fell 4.1 per cent year-over-year to $2.2bn, in line with analysts’ expectations. Net earnings attributable to Hormel were $182.5m, or 34 cents per diluted share, versus expectations for $200.8m, or 36.8 cents a share.Hormel blamed the disappointing results on a variety of factors, including “record-high input costs” for two of its primary raw materials: pork bellies — the basis for bacon and other cured meats — and beef trim, which is turned into ground beef.It also saw sales from its Jennie-O turkey products fall 9 per cent, and segment profit tumble 20 per cent, which the company blamed on “unfavourable conditions in the turkey industry” including reduced harvest volume, lower commodity prices, price competition and rising operating expenses.Muscle Milk — a ready-to-drink protein-packed beverage — turned in a wimpy showing as well, contributing to a 14 per cent decline in specialty-foods segment profits for the quarter. The company blamed the poor showing for Muscle Milk on fierce competition on convenience-store shelves.Refrigerated foods — which make up almost half of Hormel’s net sales — saw revenue decline 6 per cent, primarily as a result of the divestiture last year of its Farmer John meats business to Smithfield Foods. Nevertheless, operating profit for the segment rose 15 per cent despite higher meat costs, thanks in part to strong demand for pork products — especially its lines of fully cooked bacon, pepperoni and party trays.Its grocery products segment was also a bright spot, with sales rising 6 per cent and segment profit jumping 10 per cent on strong sales of Wholly Guacamole dips and Skippy peanut butter.Looking ahead, Hormel executives said on an investor call Thursday morning that they expected earnings pressure to continue into the current quarter, with its sticker prices failing to offset rising raw-material prices until late in the quarter.Last quarter, Hormel warned investors it was expecting full-year earnings to come in at the low end of its previously projected range of $1.65 to $1.71 a share. On Thursday, it sliced off a bigger chunk, projecting 2017 earnings to land in a range of $1.54 to $1.58 a share.“In the face of a challenging year, we are focused on our strategic initiatives and are committed to maintaining a long-term perspective on our decisions,” chief executive Jim Snee said in a statement.Including Thursday’s decline, Hormel shares have fallen 8.6 per cent year-to-date.
7;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2017-05-25T16:47:24Z;Turkey problems gobble up Hormel sales and profits;;Can there be a thing as too much turkey?For Hormel Foods, the producer of canned and cured meats and Spam, the answer is yes.Shares in Minnesota-based company fell more than 5.5 per cent on Thursday after its latest quarterly sales and profit fell short of analysts’ estimates, as an oversupply in turkeys continues to squeeze prices and profitability at its Jennie-O Turkey Store business.Sales at the unit, the company’s third largest, fell 8 per cent in the three months to end of April. Profit suffered an even steeper drop of 29 per cent as pricing pressure from competing protein groups and higher operating expenses further ate into profit margins.Hormel warned the headwinds facing the unit are not likely to let up any time soon. As a result, it now expects full-year earnings to come in at the lower end of its $1.65 to $1.71 guidance.Total group revenue — which fell 4.9 per cent at $2.18bn during the quarter — also received little support from Hormel’s refrigerated foods division, its largest, which makes bacon, party trays and Natural Choice deli meats. The unit’s sales fell 6 per cent to $1.03bn during the period following the sale of its Farmer John brand.Grocery products, Hormel’s second-biggest unit generating a fifth of group sales, remains the sole bright spot. The division behind Skippy peanut butter and the group’s flagship Spam products recorded a 7.7 per cent jump in sales.Net income for the quarter fell 2 per cent year on year to $211m and missed consensus forecasts of $214.8m.
8;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2016-08-31T22:11:44Z;Energy stocks drag S&P 500 lower;;A torpid month for US stocks ended in characteristically quiet fashion on Wednesday as investors hung back in the face of pending economic data.The S&P 500 equities benchmark had its 38th straight session without a move of 1 per cent or more, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It has been the longest such run since a 63-day stretch that began in April 2014.The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market expectations for future price moves, spent much of August at the lowest levels in two years before ticking slightly higher this week.Traders and analysts suggested a variety of causes for the sideways action, including uncertainty ahead of a September meeting in which Federal Reserve policymakers could raise interest rates. In the short term, investors were holding fire ahead of Friday’s release of the US government employment report — data that could influence the Fed.“This is a big week for economic data, but it all comes in on Friday,” said Randy Frederick, vice-president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 2,170.9, with seven of its 10 main sectors in the red. Oil stocks suffered most, tracking weaker crude prices after weekly data showed US petroleum consumption declining and inventories growing.Among those hit were Murphy Oil, down 5.6 per cent at $26.72, Chesapeake Energy, off 2.5 per cent at $6.35 and Anadarko Petroleum, losing 4.1 per cent to $53.47.Materials stocks weakened as well. Mosaic, a fertiliser producer, dropped 1.3 per cent to $30.07 as investors gave back some gains from the prior day’s news that Canadian rivals PotashCorp of Saskatchewan and Agrium were exploring a merger, a move that could tighten the oversupplied potash market.Seed company Monsanto dropped after US antitrust regulators sued to block Deere, the farm equipment maker, from buying its precision planting unit. Monsanto slipped 0.9 per cent lower to $106.50, while Deere declined 1.4 per cent to $84.55.Meanwhile, food stocks strengthened after snacks giant Mondelez International this week disclosed it had abandoned its pursuit of Hershey, the US chocolatier.Analysts believe that low margins in the food business could yet usher in a wave of takeovers. Kraft Heinz rose 1.7 per cent at $89.49, JM Smucker gained 1.5 per cent to $141.79 and Hormel Foods added 1 per cent to $38.26. Mondelez edged up 0.6 per cent to $45.02 after a big jump on Tuesday, while Hershey inched up 0.2 per cent to $99.89.The S&P 500 finished August down 0.1 per cent for the month and is up 6.2 per cent since the start of the year. Howard Silverblatt of S&P said the recent period had been “boring, but not for stock pickers”, because since mid-July more than 100 issues were up at least 10 per cent and 22 were down that much.On Wednesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 18,400.9, while the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.2 per cent to 5,213.2.
9;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
10;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2016-08-18T20:54:07Z;US energy stocks a bright spot for equity investors;Rising oil price supports the sector as cyclicals are favoured over defensive shares;US energy groups remained a bright spot on Thursday for investors in what has otherwise been a lacklustre week for Wall Street as the rally in crude oil gathers pace.The S&P 500 energy sector has climbed 2.8 per cent over the past four days, for a gain of 4 per cent during August, handily outperforming the broad market.While energy has led the market, investors have this month also sought technology and financials, while selling the high-dividend paying stocks within the utilities and telecoms sectors.The advance in energy shares on Thursday came as the price of West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, climbed $3.81 to $48.28 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced beyond the $50 threshold on Thursday for the first time since July 5. It gained $3.90 to $50.86.The oil price has been supported by several factors, including bullish weekly inventory data released on Wednesday by the US energy department, a weakening US dollar and renewed talk over a potential Opec production freeze.The gains for energy groups this week are broad, with 35 of 37 stocks in the S&P 500 energy index in the black. Among the sharpest risers have been Marathon Oil, an exploration and production group, up 13.3 per cent to $16.68. Halliburton, a large oilfield services company, has risen 6 per cent to $46.46, while integrated energy group ExxonMobil has ticked up 1.2 per cent to $88.91.Elsewhere, the shares of Harley-Davidson fluctuated after the group was accused by the US Environmental Protection Agency of selling after-market devices that circumvent emissions checks built into its motorcycles’ engines.Harley allegedly sold almost 340,000 Screamin’ Eagle engine tuners from 2008 to 2015 that boost the power of the motorcycles’ engines, but that also bypass “a device or element of design installed on the motorcycles in compliance with applicable regulations”, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Washington.The company contended in a statement that the products were “intended for off-road and closed-course competition” and not for use on public roads as the US alleged.Still, it said on Thursday morning that it forged a settlement with the US where it would “no longer sell its competition-only tuner in the US”, but would continue to sell a performance tuner “designed to ensure Harley-Davidson motorcycles retain 50-state and EPA on-road emissions compliance”. It will also pay a $12m civil penalty.Harley added that “this settlement is not an admission of liability but instead represents a good faith compromise with the EPA on areas of law we interpret differently”.Harley’s shares fell as much as 8 per cent on Thursday, but trimmed the decline to 1.7 per cent after the pact with the US was unveiled. It closed the day at $53.54.The shares of Hormel Foods, meanwhile, climbed after the group said it expected a “strong finish to fiscal 2016”.As a result, Hormel, which makes meat products, raised its earnings per share guidance for the period to $1.60-$1.64, from a previous view of $1.56-$1.60.Hormel shares rose 1.9 per cent to $37.04, reducing the year-to-date fall to 6.3 per cent.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,187, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 18,597.7, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2 per cent to 5,240.2.
11;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2016-05-18T20:27:25Z;Tesla jumps after Goldman Sachs backing;US stocks edge ahead in choppy trading session;Tesla shares shifted into top gear on Wednesday after the electric vehicle maker was upgraded by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who cited strong demand for Tesla’s cars and more stable macro backdrop for the upgrade.Shares in the carmaker advanced 3.2 per cent to $211.17 after the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and analysts maintained their price target of $250 a share.The number of analysts with a “buy” rating on the stock rose to 10 while three have a “hold” rating and six have a ‘sell’ rating, according to Bloomberg data.Elon Musk’s Model 3 mass-market vehicle, which was unveiled earlier this year, has already booked 400,000 reservations.Patrick Archambault, at Goldman, said that an update on the car, which he expects in early 2017, should “have the added benefit of driving incremental awareness and interest in the mass-market product, and has the potential to drive further reservations”.Noting the potential for positive news, Mr Archambault said that Tesla could make an announcement on a shared mobility, or journey-sharing, service at some point.Finally, he expects that a ramp-up in production of its falcon-winged Model X vehicles could also help lift shares later this year.Concerns about the company’s accelerated production plans to meet demand for the mass-market vehicle, delayed projections for positive free cash flow and delivery target misses have weighed on investor optimism, with shares down 11 per cent so far this year.But Mr Archambault said that the company’s shares were not “fully capturing the company’s disruptive potential”.The rally in Tesla shares came as US markets gave up gains after meeting minutes released from Federal Reserve showed an openness to lifting interest rates in June.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent on the day before paring back all gains to 2,047.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed nearly unchanged at 17,526.62, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,739.12.Elsewhere, Lowe’s shares advanced more than 3.3 per cent to $78.60 after the DIY chain reported stronger than expected first-quarter profits amid strong demand for home improvement goods.Profits at the retailer rose to $884m, or 98 cents a share, up from $673m or 70 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 87 cents a share topped expectations for 85 cents. Meanwhile, sales rose 7.8 per cent to $15.2bn, ahead of forecasts.Target shares fell 7.6 per cent to $67.99 after the company reported a smaller than expected increase in first quarter like-for-like sales during a challenging period for US department stores.The company said that same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 1.2 per cent, below expectations for a 1.6 per cent rise.The company said that it expected comparable sales in the current quarter to be in a range of flat or down as much as 2 per cent.The news sent shares in rival Walmart nearly 3 per cent lower to $63.14. Target’s soft sales figures followed dismal results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s.Meanwhile, shares in Hormel Foods, fell 8.6 per cent to $35.47 and were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after margins shrunk in its refrigerated foods division, raising concerns about the maker of Spam and Jenny-O Turkey.Profit margins for the company’s largest division fell to 11.9 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, from 14.4 per cent the previous quarter, said Akshay Jagdale, an analyst at Jefferies.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
12;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2016-05-18T13:47:20Z;US markets on backfoot ahead of Fed minutes;;US stocks added to Tuesday’s losses as investors reassess the timing for interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve ahead of today’s release of minutes from the central bank’s April monetary policy meeting.The S&P 500 declined 0.3 per cent to 2,041.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 17,464.58.Two Fed presidents, Dennis Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed, and Eric Rosengren of the Boston Fed, have in recent days suggested that investors’ expectations for rate increases may be too conservative.Dividend-paying utilities, which were one of the key beneficiaries of the low interest rate environment were among the biggest decliners — with the S&P 500 utilities index falling 1.3 per cent. But the S&P 500 consumer staples index fell 1.5 per cent following a sharp sell-off in shares of Hormel Foods and Wal-Mart.Expectations for an earlier than expected rate rise also weighed on gold, as the precious metal offers no yield. Gold prices slid 0.8 per cent to $1,268.29 an ounce.
13;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2016-03-02T15:23:54Z;Healthy bars and nibbles reshape US snacks market;Busier lifestyles and demographic shifts help change consumer tastes;Daniel Lubetzky became tired of waiting for a company to produce the sort of healthy snacks he craved. So he started making his own.“In the early 2000s, I was travelling a lot and kept finding that there weren’t healthy snacks available that tasted good and satisfied my hunger,” social entrepreneur Mr Lubetzky says. “These frustrations with my own snacking options sparked the idea for Kind.”He was not the only one with cravings for healthy snacks. Kind Snacks, which makes nut and fruit bars, sells its products in 150,000 stores, with sales rising 36 per cent last year. It is one of many start-ups either taking on America’s food giants in the growing healthier snack sector — or being bought by them.Sales of snacks — including bakery snacks, biscuits, confectionery, ice cream, snack bars, yoghurt and savoury snacks — jumped 17.4 per cent to $145bn in the five years to 2015, according to Euromonitor. This growth is being driven by products which are perceived as more healthy, analysts and executives say. And they are confident that trend will continue.“It’s certainly going to continue to be one of our growth platforms,” says James Snee, chief operating officer at Hormel Foods in a recent interview. “At our core we’re protein based so the idea of being able to . . . take from traditional formats [and transform] into snacking formats serves us well.”US sales of energy and nutrition bars have surged 87.5 per cent to $2.48bn in the five years to 2015, while nuts have increased 34.7 per cent to $4.55bn, fruit bars have risen 16.5 per cent to $1.17bn and yoghurt has risen 26.8 per cent to $8.38bn, according to Euromonitor.The shift towards foods perceived to be healthier is changing America’s food industry, and this is particularly the case in snacks. For a number of years, consumers have been more aware of the types of food they eat amid a nationwide obesity and diabetes type 2 crisis.Busier lifestyles and a more diverse population is also driving the rise in snacking, highlighting the growing importance of convenience. Driven by millennials, consumers are eating on the go more often than in the past, sometimes using snacks to replace meals, executives say. The average consumer eats five times a day, Tyson Foods points out. A shift to city dwelling means smaller kitchens for some and less cooking.Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market. It’s bringing in a lot of companies“The traditional image of mom and dad sitting down for dinner at 6pm with two children . . . is as outdated as the typewriter,” Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup, recently told investors. “We live in a polycultural society with diverse tastes and norms. The one size fits all approach is long gone.”But what exactly is a healthier snack? There is no single definition and what consumers find important health wise can change over time and between generations. For some, the focus on weight loss or low carbohydrates has shifted to eating less processed fare even if it is not so low in fat.Protein has become a focus, leading to a renaissance in high-end jerky sales, but the product still contains relatively high salt levels. And some nutrition bars may contain largely unprocessed ingredients but still have sugar levels comparable to candy bars.A key trend at the moment is having only simple and recognisable ingredients in food — known as clean labelling. This means free from artificial colours, preservatives and additives. Organic continues to grow in popularity as does GMO-free food.“The things that people are most worried about vary,” says Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein. “Over the past two or three years, there has been a massive conversation online about fillers and preservatives. There’s definitely been opting for ‘I don’t want artificial’.”Leaders in the snacks market, such as PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay and Mondelez, have for some time been introducing products and technology aimed at removing the guilt from indulging. Pepsi in December introduced a smart vending machine selling its “better for you” snacks with a digital function that gives nutritional information. Meanwhile, Mondelez is targeting half of its sales to come from its “wellbeing” snacks, up from a third now.Demand for healthier snacks has lured companies who previously had little or no exposure to the category as well as newer companies such as Kind and Graze of the UK, which sells trays of nuts and dried fruit via online subscription.Abbott Laboratories — a nutrition and medical devices company — this month introduced its first new range of snack bars in more than a decade.Tyson, a relative newcomer to snacks via its Hillshire brands acquisition, is capitalising on “gourmet” jerky sales, as is chocolate maker Hershey, which has bought jerky brand Krave.“Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market,” says Jared Koerton, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s bringing in a lot of companies into a new market [for them], or ones trying to expand into new product areas.”

Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 37 cents a share on sales of $2.4bn.Hormel, based in Minnesota, said the “strong earnings performance” in the quarter had prompted it to raise its full-year earnings forecast to $1.50-$1.56 a share, compared with its previous outlook for $1.43-$1.48. That topped expectations for $1.47 a share.The shares advanced more than 7 per cent to $44.44, taking their rise over the past 12 months to 59.5 per cent.At a time when concerns about the trajectory of the US economy are on the rise, analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded US discount retailers Dollar General and Dollar Tree, citing “the sector’s resilience to any macro slowdown”.Shares in Dollar General climbed 3.7 per cent to $73.04 after the move from “equalweight” to “overweight”. Its price target rose to $95 from $80.Dollar Tree, which last year won a drawn-out battle with Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar, rose 4.4 per cent to $78.55 after an upgrade from “underweight” to “equalweight”. Its price target was raised 38 per cent to $90.Groupon shares jumped 41.2 per cent to $4.08 after Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce juggernaut, revealed that it had bought nearly 33m shares in the US coupons company in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Friday.The purchase makes Alibaba the fourth-largest shareholder in Groupon with a 5.6 per cent stake.Financials advanced for a second trading day after JPMorgan upgraded two US banks citing their “excellent capital position”.Shares in Goldman Sachs climbed 2 per cent to $149.02 after analysts raised the stock from “underweight” to “overweight” and lifted their price target from $170 to $180.Morgan Stanley gained 2.7 per cent to $23.72 after the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” and the price target was lowered 12 per cent to $29.Shares of banks were under pressure this month amid declining expectations of US interest rate rises and concerns about their energy exposure after the swoon in crude prices.After being closed on Monday for Presidents’ Day, US markets reopened on the front foot, even as crude prices swung sharply after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to freeze oil output at January levels.At the close, the S&P 500 had risen 1.7 per cent to 1,895.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.4 per cent to 16,196.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.3 per cent to 4,435.96.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The S&P 500 is down almost 10 per cent this year; US bank shares are down 20 per cent; it is best to look away from European bank shares; junk bond yields are bubbling up. This is what fear looks like.If you are the more common type, who is fearful when others are fearful, you are either selling or rotating into defensive shares. This means things such as consumer staples. In the last big bear market, from late 2007 to early 2009, the S&P 500 lost half its value. Its staples components only lost a quarter.Walmart stood out: it rose during the crash. And its shares have risen in 2016. Alas, Amazonand discount stores have changed retail. Walmart 2016 is anticipating lower profits. In 2007, it was growing.Better, surely, to own the companies that make what consumers buy no matter what. Hormel — which makes spam and other long-lasting foods you will eat while in your basement hiding from zombies — fell only 15 per cent in 2007-09. Kimberly-Clark, which is a bet that people will keep wiping their noses and going to the bathroom, outperformed too. Or maybe, like a lot of people, you’ve resumed smoking in the new year. Altria had an even better crisis than Kimberly-Clark.There is a little problem, though. All those stocks are much more expensive, relative to profits, than they were when the market turned in 2007. Back then you could have Hormel for 16 times earnings. Now you pay 30. Kimberly-Clark and Altria have gone from 16 times to more than 20. Price/earnings ratios are 15 per cent higher since 2007 for the staples group generally. Revenue growth is much lower, too.The safety trade that worked so well in 2007 was never fully unwound. And stocks, in general, are more expensive than they were at the last peak. Quantitative easing, designed to push everyone towards risk, worked.

This topped Wall Street expectations for earnings of 73 cents a share, but was down 46 per cent from a year ago.However, weakness in the construction equipment market and the global agricultural sector pushed equipment sales 26 per cent lower to $5.9bn, shy of analysts’ estimates for $6.1bn. Total revenue declined 25 per cent to $6.7bn.Bumper harvests have weighed on grain prices and the Department of Agricultural said this week that US net farm income was forecast to decline 38 per cent in 2015. That in turn has hurt demand for agricultural equipment.Deere warned that global sales of agriculture and turf equipment, its largest division, were forecast to decrease by about 8 per cent in fiscal 2016.Construction and forestry equipment sales, its second-largest division, are expected to declined 5 per cent in 2016.The outlook also reflects the sting from currency translation as many of Deere’s key international markets have seen their currencies weakened, while the US dollar has strengthened.For the year, the company projects earnings of $1.4bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.“[The] stock could trade up on short covering due to solid cost control, but guidance for 2016 suggests end market and earnings declines are continuing,” said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies.Deere shares, which have declined nearly 10 per cent this year, climbed 4.8 per cent to $80.Shares in Hormel Foods gained 3.1 per cent to $73.55, after the maker of Spam, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O turkeys said its board had authorised a two-for-one stock split. The news arrived a day after the Minnesota-based company forecast stronger than expected 2016 earnings.Hormel is the latest company electing to split its shares, a decision that often bolsters investor interest in buying shares due to the reduction in price. Earlier this year Nike, Kroger and Netflix, announced their own stock splits.HP Inc was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 falling 13.6 per cent to $12.65, after the maker of PCs and printers issued disappointing first-quarter guidance.Hewlett-Packard separated into two companies in October. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the IT operations company, also issued disappointing earnings outlook, but shares climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.12.Guess shares jumped more than 6.8 per cent to $20.86, after the retailer reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations.The Los Angeles-based company said profits slid 40 per cent to $12.4m, or 15 cents a share, however this was better than the 11 cents that analysts had forecast. Sales slid nearly 12 per cent to $521m.Guess lifted the lower end of its earnings outlook and now sees full-year earnings in the range of 93 cents to $1.02 a share, compared with estimates for 96 cents.US stocks inched higher and healthcare stocks led the benchmark S&P 500, rising 0.5 per cent.At close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly unchanged at 2,088.87 and 17,813.39 respectively.

17;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hormel: Spam, Spam, Spam, span and profits;Processed meats may cause cancer but strong brands cause wealth;It is easy to see why Bismark counselled against watching sausages being made. Without packaging, processed meat is just a glistening coil of pink sludge. Yet 4bn tonnes of it sells every year in the US alone. The key additives? Salt and, even more important, branding: soothing images of sun-dappled farmland, happy animals and bearded farmers.“Carcinogenic to humans,” on the other hand, is poor branding. On Monday the World Health Organisation confirmed that a daily bacon roll measurably raises the (quite small) risk of colorectal cancer. The meat lobby is outraged, of course. Should investors worry too?Consider Hormel, the US company that invented (and still sells) Spam and a herd of other meaty products. Its shares have risen 200 per cent since 2010, thrashing the wider market. Hormel has, over a century, invented or bought into ever more ways of satisfying the US hunger for protein and fat. Alongside cured pig meats, its products include turkey breasts, peanut butter and guacamole.A lifetime of gorging on sausage and ham might well raise cancer risks. But so do plenty of other lifestyle choices, none of which has proven vulnerable to public health campaigns. The country that invented fast food is not going to quit fat, salt and meat easily.Three years ago Hormel’s price/earnings ratio was in line with the market. Now it stands at 24, an eight-point premium. Surely this leaves little room for error? But the product is almost beside the point: Hormel is that rare thing: a well-managed, barely leveraged consumer business with strong brands, selling nearly all its product into the solidly growing US market. Its rating is right in line with other strong consumer brands.In the post-crisis world economy, the combination of a little growth (brands mean pricing power) and a fundamentally defensive business model (selling food to Americans) is irresistible.

18;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2015-05-20T18:29:48Z;Bird flu scare fails to deter Hormel;US stocks muted ahead of release of Fed minutes;Hormel Foods was one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the US meat processor reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates despite the impact of lower pork prices and avian flu.Hormel, the company behind Spam and Jennie-O Turkey Store food products, reported profits of $180.2m or 67 cents a share, compared with $141m or 52 cents a share in the prior-year period. Sales rose 2 per cent to $2.3bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of 62 cents a share, on sales of $2.4bn.The company said sales fell 8 per cent at its refrigerated foods division, Hormel’s largest revenue provider, amid a decline in pork prices and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture. Profits, however, rose 52 per cent on the back of lower input costs.Last month, the company said the highly contagious H5N2 avian influenza had been found at several of its turkey suppliers and that outbreaks in Minnesota, home to the largest production of turkeys in the US, and Wisconsin, would impact its operations.“While we enjoyed an excellent first half, we expect Jennie-O Turkey Store to be significantly challenged going forward due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain,” said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chief executive.Jennie-O was the company’s second-largest revenue contributor last year with Hormel deriving 18 per cent of its sales from the division.Shares of Hormel Foods, which gained 20 per cent in the past year, climbed more than 4 per cent to $58.14.Better than expected first-quarter profits and same-store sales growth pushed shares of teen apparel retailer, American Eagle Outfitters, 5.5 per cent higher to $16.61.The Pittsburgh-based company said comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 7 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent decline in the prior-year period. This topped Wall Street estimates for 5.4 per cent growth.The company also said net profits climbed to $29m, or 15 cents a share, for the three months to May 2, from $3.9m, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 8 per cent to $699.5m.Analysts had forecast earnings of 11 cents a share, on sales of $691.5m.The results come during a challenging time in the teen apparel market as rivals like Aéropostale and Abercrombie & Fitch, all known for their logo-centric offerings, are struggling to compete with fast fashion retailers like H&M and Zara.The company said it expects second-quarter earnings in the range of 11 to 14 cents a share, ahead of estimates for 10 cents a share.Etsy shares tumbled 18 per cent to $17.20 after the online market place reported a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss in its debut results as a public company.The company reported a loss of $36.6m, or 84 cents a share, compared with a loss of $463,000, or one cent a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose from $40.5m to $58.5m, just ahead of analysts’ forecasts.US stocks remained muted ahead of the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s April meeting.The S&P 500 slid 0.1 per cent to 2,125.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 per cent to 18.285.40 and the Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 5,071.74.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

This was up from $157.3m or 58 cents a share in the same period a year ago.Sales rose 9 per cent to $2.54bn. Hormel’s fourth-quarter sales were mostly in line with Wall Street expectations but earnings were just shy of forecasts for 64 cents a share.Full-year adjusted earnings guidance was in the range of $2.45-$2.55 a share, below forecasts for $2.59 a share. The company also said that it expected to exceed its 2015 goals of 5 per cent sales growth, while analysts have forecast 6 per cent growth.The increase in beef prices has pushed consumers towards Hormel’s processed-pork products. Sales in its core refrigerated foods division increased 9.4 per cent to $1.2bn.“We anticipate pork commodity prices and pork operating margins to normalise as the year progresses, providing input cost relief for our grocery products team, but leading to challenging comparisons for our refrigerated foods group in 2015,” Jeffrey Ettinger, president and chief executive, said.Shares of Hormel slipped 5 per cent to $51.32 but are up 15 per cent so far this year.DSW shares gained 2 per cent to $34.38, after the discount footwear retailer topped third-quarter estimates.DSW reported net income of $49.5m or 55 cents a share, on sales of $669.9m. This beat Wall Street expectations for earnings of 52 cents a share, on sales of $661m.Better than expected third-quarter same store sales, a key metric for retailers in the Americas, lifted Tiffany shares more than 2 per cent to $107.60.The luxury retailer reported an 11 per cent gain in same-store sales in the Americas, ahead of estimates for a 6.1 per cent gain. In Asia-Pacific, meanwhile, same-store sales unexpectedly fell 3 per cent, missing expectations for a 2.8 per cent gain.Net sales for the third quarter rose 5 per cent to $960m. However, net profits tumbled 60 per cent to $38.3m, or 29 cents a share, following a one-off debt repayment during the quarter.Adjusted earnings of 76 cents a share were just short of estimates for 77 cents a share.“While the Americas region has been a steady outperformer, volatility outside the US continues to weigh on fundamental performance, which is limiting upside for the time being, in our view,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said. “Longer term, we believe Tiffany’s growth prospects are favourable given its dominant position in the global luxury category.”Pandora shares slipped 2 per cent to $19.31, after analysts at FBR Capital Markets downgraded the stock from “market perform” to “underperform” and cut the price target from $28 to $11.After posting its 46th record close for the year on Monday, the US benchmark struggled to extend its gains following a morning of mixed economic data. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,067.03, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed little changed on the day at 17,814.94.

20;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2014-08-21T16:49:51Z;Sears ‘unacceptable’ results hit retailer;;Investor disappointment over the latest results from Sears, which the US retailer acknowledged as “unacceptable”, wiped 7 per cent from the value of the company.Edward Lampert, the chief executive of Sears, made the admission as the company reported its loss had widened to $573m in the quarter to August 2, compared with $194m in the same period last year. It was the sixth straight quarterly loss, for the retailer.Same-store sales overall crept 0.8 per cent higher in the quarter compared with a year ago. However, sales at Kmart, a chain also owned by Sears, weakened 1.7 per cent for the quarter.Like competitors such as JC Penney and Kohl’s, Sears – a fixture for American consumers for decades – is being squeezed by the economy’s slow recovery and the growth of online retailing.In response, Mr Lampert, who is also the largest investor in Sears, has announced plans to close 130 stores and has spun off its Land’s End chain.The stock closed down 7.2 per cent to $33.38 in New York trading.Poor results from Staples also continued to affect the office supply chain store, which fell another 3 per cent to $10.97 after on Wednesday reporting weak earnings and plans to close an additional 140 stores.Faced with competition online and restructuring costs, net income in the quarter dropped 21 per cent to $82m. The office supplies company closed 80 stores during the quarter, contributing to a 2 per cent decline in sales.Chipotle Mexican Grill stock rose less than 1 per cent to $681.07, approaching record highs earlier in the day, as analysts raised expectations for third quarter sales.Steve Gojak of Cleveland Research predicted in a report released on Thursday that same-store sales would rise 19 to 20 per cent this quarter, higher than the average forecast of 15 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The popular Mexican restaurant chain’s shares have jumped nearly 70 per cent in the past year, outperforming its fast food peers, despite price hikes in April, with sales climbing 29 per cent in the third quarter.Minnesota-based luncheon meat-maker Hormel Foods also beat estimates for third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares 4 per cent higher.Hormel’s profits rose 21 per cent to a record $138m, from $113.6m a year ago, thanks to solid demand for pork and turkey and refrigerated foods, chief executive Jeffrey Ettinger said in a statement.Hewlett-Packard shares opened more than 5 per cent higher on Thursday after the PC maker reported late on Wednesday modest third-quarter revenue growth, defying analyst expectations for a decline.HP’s third quarter sales rose 1 per cent to $27.6bn, up from $27.2bn a year ago. Analysts had forecast a fall in revenue to $27.0bn.The unexpected growth was driven by personal computer sales, which jumped 12 per cent from the previous year.The company struggled to reinvent itself as personal computer sales shrank across the industry and cloud computing gained popularity. In May, HP announced it would cut as many as 16,000 more jobs, in addition to the 34,000 jobs lost in 2012, as part of restructuring plans.Shares in Hertz fell 1 per cent to $30.10 after a choppy day of trading the day before. The shares opened 12 per cent lower on Wednesday after the car rental company cut its forecast for the year, however later that day shares rebounded after activist investor Carl Icahn. disclosed an 8.48 per cent stake. The company has faced several operational challenges, including the effects of vehicle recalls by carmakers, and the fallout from accounting errors disclosed earlier this year.Overall, US equities were stronger. The S&P 500, up almost 8 per cent this year, touched a fresh intraday high on Wednesday after better news from America’s housing market and manufacturing sector.By close the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,992.37, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 17,039.49.

21;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Meat producers: talking turkey;US poultry producers are clucking, and for good reason;Too soon? Some Americans may be too full to think about chicken, pork and beef – and don’t even mention turkey. But US poultry producers are clucking, and for good reason. Last year, they endured a severe drought in the Midwestern part of the country. The price of corn – a key component of feed – spiked above $8 a bushel in 2012. It has since fallen back to half that, and the US will harvest a record crop this autumn.Lower grain costs factored into the positive outlook at Hormel Foods, which this week said it expected earnings per share in 2014 to rise as much as 16 per cent. Hormel processes turkey and pork and manufactures packaged foods such as Spam and Dinty Moore stew. Now is a good time to be in the turkey business. As input costs have fallen, so have production levels (242m birds in 2013 versus 254m, according to the USDA). That bodes well for pricing. But it is not all good news down on the farm. The outlook for hogs is less clear – a virus has created uncertainty. Still, in 2013, Hormel also bought Skippy brand peanut butter, which it expects will lift earnings per share by a mid-single digit percentage this fiscal year.Investors are already reaping gains. Shares of Hormel have risen 50 per cent over the past year as prospects improved. At $45, the stock trades at 20 times next year’s earnings. Fellow meat producers Tyson Foods (chicken, beef and pork) and Pilgrim’s Pride (chicken), which have also rallied sharply, trade at 12 and 9 times, respectively. These two are more pure commodity plays than Hormel, which is a diversified seller of branded products. That justifies some premium. Hormel’s earnings multiple was also higher than the median – 17 times – over the past 10 years. Here, too, expansion is warranted given growth expectations and the addition of Skippy.But at these prices, Hormel is starting to look a bit stuffed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Hormel, ConAgra, Campbell, Smucker, General Mills, Kellogg, and, in Europe, Nestlé have all managed to outperform.The case for remaining overweight in the sector is familiar. The stocks are defensive, at a time when an ageing stock market rally, combined with an unsteady economy, is making investors nervous. For those suffering from central bank-induced paranoia, they should be good inflation hedges too – inelastic demand for their products translates to pricing power. And they tend to be good dividend payers, for those on the run from terrible bond yields. In short, food shares are a bit like other shares in the era of quantitative easing, only more so.Those who still honour the first rule of valuations – that they can’t remain inflated for ever – will be tempted to slim down. Multiples of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation across the sector are at or near historical highs, data from Capital IQ show. Warren Buffett’s recent display of appetite, when he paid an unheard-of 14 times forward ebitda for Heinz, may be encouraging. But when smaller investors shell out, say, 10 times for Hormel or 12 for Nestlé, they will not enjoy the risk-reducing 6 per cent overall yield Mr Buffett gets with his Heinz stake. The sad fact is that for those who are prevented from holding cash by the need for returns or fear of inflation, there may be few options better than food shares.

23;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2013-01-06T18:20:35Z;Hormel – rock steady performance;About as safe a stock as one can own;"How is this for a defensive stock: the company that makes the food you will be eating as you sit in the bomb shelter waiting for Armageddon. Spam; canned chilli, beef stew, and hash; assorted cured meats; microwavable side–dishes. Not for the gourmet, perhaps, but Hormel offers perfectly palatable ways to greet the end of days.Of interest to financial survivalists is Hormel’s rock-steady performance. The shares have more than doubled the return of the wider market during the last decade, and whipped consumer-staples indices too. Margins have widened steadily over that period (though they were squeezed a bit by commodity prices last year). The company has failed to lift sales in two of the last 20 years, and those contractions were 1 and 3 per cent. Lyndon Johnson was president the last year the company didn’t raise its dividend. About half the shares belong to the company’s foundation, so management can focus on the long- term.Last week the company bought Skippy peanut butter, the number two brand in the US, from Unilever. The price, a bit less than 2 times expected annual sales, is not cheap by packaged food standards (Hormel itself trades at 1x). Investors didn’t mind, bumping the shares – already at an all-time high – up 7 per cent in the two days following the announcement.Hormel itself doesn’t come cheap: it trades at 18.5 times trailing earnings, more than two points higher than its average during the last five years. That said, even at the current level, Hormel is about as safe a stock as one can own, and its valuation is not much higher than peers’. What is worrying is how much an unexciting, well-managed, low-to-moderate growth company costs in the current market. This is no reason to head for the bomb shelter; but buying a few extra cans of spam might be wise.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
24;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2013-01-04T22:51:34Z;Spam and Skippy: together in China;;"Most people probably don’t think Spam lunchmeat and Skippy peanut butter make a good pairing.But Hormel Foods, maker of the canned curiosity, begs to differ. The Minnesota-based company on Thursday said it would acquire the Skippy peanut butter business from Unilever for $700m – the largest deal in the company’s history. Among the rationales for the move? China.Hormel, which has tried to build up its Spam business in China, is hoping to piggyback on the success of Skippy in the country. The brand is the top selling peanut butter in China, where it generates $30m-$40m in annual sales (or 30-40 per cent of Skippy’s international sales).The fact that Skippy has a plant in China and has been there longer will help Hormel “accelerate our progress in selling Spam in that market”, Jeffrey Ettinger, Hormel chief executive, said in a call with analysts on Thursday.There’s no denying that Hormel can do with a boost to its international sales. The company makes most of its money in the US, with only about 4 per cent of its revenues coming from abroad.But talk is cheap. As many foreign food makers have learned the hard way, selling foodstuff to the world’s most populous country is no straightforward matter (Campbell Soup, for example, has struggled for years to persuade China’s legion of homemade soup eaters to buy canned version of the stuff).Seen as a poor man’s meat in the US, Hormel’s strategy for the luncheon meat in China has been to position it as a premium product.From Bloomberg:[Hormel Foods International President Rick] Bross is betting that Spam’s “Made in America” provenance will allow Hormel to sell the meat for $3.20 a can, almost 40 percent more than the price of local products. Hormel has tweaked Spam’s formulation to make it “meatier” to appeal to Chinese tastes, taking a page from Oreo cookies, which in China are less sweet, slightly smaller, and sold in flavors such as green tea ice cream. Without a big advertising budget for China, Hormel’s marketers are focusing on in-store billboards (Slogan: Juicy meaty satisfaction, hot or cold, Spam hits the spot) and product tastings. There also are recipes on Spam’s Chinese-language website. (Spam with shrimp lotus root, anyone?) “The challenge is convincing consumers that the satisfaction is worth the premium they will pay for the product,” Bross says.$3.20 is a lot for a can of processed meat, considering that minimum wage in the country starts as low as Rmb 8.5 ($1.36) an hour. As Jason Ding, a partner in the Beijing office of consultancy Roland Berger, told Bloomberg, the Chinese may simply opt to buy fresh meat rather than premium-priced Spam.And what of peanut butter? While peanut and peanut oil are an important part of the diet in China, American-style peanut butter remains a novelty in the country (It’s easy to be the top selling peanut butter brand in a small market with little competition).The smart move will probably be for Hormel to leverage the Skippy foreign brand and introduce Skippy-branded food products like peanut sauce (which the Chinese use for noodles) or peanut brittles.Whatever it decides, Hormel will need to make sure it caters to local tastes.Related reading:

25;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hormel acquires Skippy for $700m;;Hormel Foods will acquire Skippy, the number-two peanut butter brand in the US, from Unilever for $700m, as it seeks to expand beyond its traditional meat business and into international markets.The Minnesota-based company, famous as the maker of Spam tinned meat, said on Thursday that it expected Skippy’s total annual sales to be about $370m, with almost $100m of that coming from outside the US, including China, where Skippy is the top-selling peanut butter.“The fast growing international line will . . . strengthen our global presence, and should be a useful complement to our sales strategy in China for the Spam family of products,” said Jeffrey Ettinger, Hormel chief executive.While international growth opportunities are attractive for the 80-year-old brand, Ken Perkins, analyst at Morningstar, said the picture was more challenging in the US.“They’re going to have the majority of their business from the US, which is facing pretty fierce competition and high household penetration,” he said.Hormel said peanut butter remains the second-most popular sandwich ingredient – despite what some research suggests is a dramatic rise in peanut allergies and food safety concerns. A large-scale salmonella outbreak last year resulted in the Food and Drug Administration halting production at Sunland, the largest organic peanut butter processor in the US.Mr Ettinger, in a conference call after the announcement, said Hormel was “on the leading edge” of food safety.Hormel reported $500m in net income on $8.23bn in revenue in the fiscal year ended in October 2012. It focuses primarily on fresh, packaged, cured and canned meats, but also produces side dishes including mashed potatoes and pasta under the Country Crock brand, which it operates under license from Unilever. The 80-year-old Skippy brand, Mr Ettinger said, doesn’t immediately provide for cross-selling with Hormel’s meat products – as, say, its Country Crock products do – but fits the company because it is an “iconic American brand”, just like Spam.The acquisition will also help Hormel diversify away from its poultry, pork and beef businesses, Mr Ettinger said during the conference call. Jennie-O turkey and Dinty Moore stew and have been hit by the recent US drought which saw corn and soyabean feed prices spikeSkippy production plants in Little Rock, Arkansas and Weifang, China are included in the transaction, Unilever said in a statement. The disposal comes as Unilever is clearing its cupboards of smaller and more country-specific brands. It sold its Chicken Tonight and Ragu brands in the UK and Ireland in 2012Shares in Hormel were up 3.7 per cent in New York. It said it expected the Skippy acquisition to add 13 to 17 cents to earnings per share in its 2014 fiscal year.The companies signed a definitive agreement, subject to regulatory approval. The sale is expected to close early this year.Barclays is advising Hormel, while Lazard and the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore advised Unilever.Additional reporting by Louise Lucas
26;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2012-09-28T20:03:50Z;The unpalatable business of spam;A new article provides a fascinating overview on the dynamics of unsolicited email and the fight to keep it at bay;"A couple try to get cooked breakfasts at a greasy spoon, but their attempts to order are frustrated. The menu largely consists of Spam, and in any case the conversation – and indeed, the following sketch – is swamped by a crowd of Vikings singing “Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam”. A typical Monty Python skit, really.Unsolicited email, often selling fake pills or watches, has a similar ability to drown out sensible communication, which may be why the name “spam” stuck, despite the initial protestations of the trademark owners, Hormel Foods.Spam email rarely reaches my inbox these days, but this isn’t because spam itself is a thing of the past. Most emails “out there” are spam, but the vast majority are intercepted at some point.So where do these emails come from? How? Who pays for them? And who pays for our defences against them? A new article by Justin Rao and David Reiley in the Journal of Economic Perspectives provides a fascinating overview.It would be easy to block spam sent from a single fixed source, so spam emails are sent by “botnets”, swarms of home computers that have fallen prey to viruses and been co-opted by the spammers. These botnets are rented by merchants, who use a bewildering variety of aliases. One group of researchers identified 30 pharmaceutical merchants who, between them, were using almost 1,000 different “store front” web-page styles, more than 50,000 domain names and almost 350 million distinct URLs.But who buys these products, typically shipping from China or India, from such obviously shady sources? Almost nobody. Rao and Reiley estimate that the hit rate is about one sale per 10 million emails sent – but then sending 10 million emails might only cost $50 or $60, so the spam continues.If it’s clear who benefits from sending spam, it’s less clear who pays to block it. One case is instructive: when the vast Rustock botnet was shut down last spring, Microsoft and Pfizer (manufacturer of the genuine Viagra) took leading roles and Microsoft offered a $250,000 reward. This single episode reduced the proportion of spam email from almost 90 per cent to 75 per cent, creating large spillover benefits.This seems typical: the big beasts of the internet have the incentive to fight spam, and it’s striking that the big three webmail providers with the resources to keep spam at bay – Google, Microsoft and Yahoo – have seen their market share rise from under 60 per cent to over 80 per cent since 2006. (Rao and Reiley wrote their working paper at Yahoo before moving to Microsoft and Google respectively.)Economists often talk about “negative externalities” – private activities that produce public costs. Driving a car might produce a social cost of about 10 pence for every pound of private benefit, which is why economists advocate fuel duty and congestion charges. But the externality ratio for spam is about a thousand times higher – perhaps £100 per pound of private benefit. Vast resources are devoted to blocking spam, or deleting it when it gets through, but the actual benefit to the spammers is relatively tiny. Rao and Reiley reckon that even car theft has a lower externality ratio – at least the thief gets a car.All this put me in mind of two immigration lawyers, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, often credited with being the first spammers back in 1994. Canter and Siegel defended their unsolicited bulletin board advertising: it was a matter of free speech, they said, and then published a book called How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway. In the end, the real fortunes are being made by the likes of Amazon and Google. Spam is a small industry; annual revenues are about what Apple makes in a single day. Alas, it is a small industry with a long shadow.Tim Harford is the presenter of Radio 4’s ‘More or Less’."

The stock tumbled 21 per cent to $30.76 for the worst performance on Wall Street.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity lowered their price target from $52 to $41, noting that sales trends are deteriorating. They also forecast a loss in the next quarter because of weaker sales and margins that stem from “serious problems in merchandising”.Matthew Boss, analyst at JPMorgan, put his $34 price target under review, echoing concerns about the outlook and the risky nature of Big Lots’ “close-out” retail business.“While the Big Lots model is historically more volatile, we believe increasing competitive pressures on the consumables side combined with rising discretionary pressure and online competition raises long-term structural concerns,” he said.The broader market closed lower on Thursday after an unexpected rise in initial jobless claims last week. The number of unemployment-insurance claimants rose to the highest level in a month, even as the US labour market has shown signs of improvement.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.8 per cent at 1,402.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9 per cent to 13,057.46 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.7 per cent to 3,053.40.“It looks like markets are not trading on fundamentals of the economic data, which are deteriorating globally, but are trading on the likelihood of central bank stimulus,” said Channing Smith, equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“Traders do not want to miss the rally once the stimulus is announced. On top of that, the volumes have been really low, exaggerating moves,” he added.The broad-based sell-off was led by the materials and utilities sectors, down 1.7 and 1 per cent respectively.United States Steel was the worst-hit stock among materials, down 6.9 per cent to $21.19. Anthony Rizzuto at Dahlman Rose downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold”, citing concerns about a drop in prices of domestic steel.Rival Nucor dropped 3.5 per cent to $39.14 and Cliffs Natural Resources shed 5.5 per cent to $37.32.Technology stocks remained in focus in the wake of disappointing results from Dell and Hewlett-Packard.HP shares dropped 8.1 per cent to $17.63 the day after the PC maker announced a record $8.9bn loss in the second quarter and narrowed its full-year outlook.Analysts at Credit Suisse said HP’s fundamental trends remained weak, with revenue declines in all five major divisions. “[The] shares are inexpensive, but given weak fundamentals, a low multiple is warranted,” they said, retaining their target price of $25.Dell lost another 3.7 per cent to $11.24 after sliding 5.4 per cent during the previous session on disappointing quarterly results.Intel, which manufactures microchips used in personal computers dropped 2.7 per cent to $25.04.

The clothing retailer missed consensus estimates and cut its full-year earnings projections, citing increased use of discounts and excess inventory.By contrast, Hormel Foods shares rose 1.4 per cent to $28.82 after the food processing company’s second-quarter profits beat estimates, and it reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast.Shares in Safeway, the supermarket group, dropped 4.1 per cent to $15.31 after analysts at Jefferies downgraded it to “hold” from “buy”.“Industry fundamentals are weakening, in part due to higher gas prices and an acceleration of competitive openings, which may be compounded by a spike in food inflation,” wrote Scott Mushkin, equity analyst.Salesforce.com shares dropped more than 5 per cent to $146.77 in the after-hours market despite its earnings report beating analysts’ estimates. The enterprise software provider reported $732m in revenue, topping expectations of $728.3m.Among the winners was money manager Federated Investors, up 4.3 per cent to $21.51, after news that the SEC chairwoman Mary Schapiro admitted defeat in her quest to impose tougher rules on money-market mutual funds.First Solar was up 2.8 per cent to $24.61.

28;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2012-08-23T18:03:36Z;Grain prices put Hormel under pressure;;Hormel Foods said on Thursday that rising grain prices would put pressure on its business later this year, signalling that the impact of the worst drought in 50 years will not spare cheaper brands such as Spam.“Increased grain costs will present a challenge,” Jeffrey Ettinger, Hormel’s chief executive, said.Mr Ettinger said the company ha annual contracts with many of its suppliers, which would offset rising costs and that it was in talks with its food service customers to determine how grain costs would affect retail pricing. In the short term, beef costs would probably decline as farmers accelerated slaughters to cope with lack of feed, he said.Food companies have been warning that the drought will lead to an initial dip in their prices this year and then a spike in 2013.Mr Ettinger’s comments came as Hormel reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings, driven by growth in its five food divisions.Net earnings rose 13 per cent year-on-year to $111.2m, or 41 cents a share. Revenues were up 5.1 per cent to $2bn.Hormel, which makes Spam canned ham, Jennie-O Turkey and Natural Choice deli meats, maintained its earnings outlook in spite of the prospect of rising commodity costs.Shares of Hormel were up 1.76 per cent to $28.92 in midday trading.
29;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2012-02-13T23:24:27Z;McDonald’s bows to pressure on pig crates;;Bowing to pressure from animal rights activists, McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, said that it will require its pork suppliers to stop using gestation crates, which have been criticised for inhumanely immobilising pigs.The company said on Monday that it plans to contact its suppliers to develop plans for alternative methods of handling pigs. McDonald’s expects to announce a timetable and details of the plans in May.“McDonald’s wants to see the end of sow confinement in gestation stalls in our supply chain, said Dan Gorsky, senior vice-president of McDonald’s North America supply chain management.Mr Gorsky said that the gestation stalls are not a “sustainable production system”.The Humane Society of the United States praised the decision, calling it “important and promising”.Lindsay Rajt, spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or Peta, said she was encouraged that McDonald’s was moving away from the “iron maiden” cages, but argued that McDonald’s still needs to improve its treatment of chickens in the US.McDonald’s is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of pork, which it uses to make bacon, sausages and McRib sandwiches.The move comes as other companies, including Cargill, Smithfield Foods, Burger King and Hormel, have recently said they will purchase pork from farmers that use larger cages or pens.In spite of the criticism over the gestation cages, the National Pork Board defended the practice on Monday.“There are numerous ways, including sow gestation stalls, to provide proper care for sows,” the group said in a statement. “Each housing system, including gestation stalls, open pens, free-access stalls and pastures, has welfare advantages and disadvantages that must be considered by an individual farmer.”

Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent to $29.83 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $16.77.Financials was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 index, down only 0.5 per cent. But, in a reminder of the sector’s ongoing legal problems, Citigroup and Bank of America were both among the 11 banks sued by broker Charles Schwab for manipulating Libor rates by underestimating borrowing costs from 2007 onwards.Apple shares declined 0.7 per cent to $373.72 but still outperformed the market, despite the news that Steve Jobs will resign as chief executive. Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, said “A CEO change had [already] been partly discounted.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating, adding: “We expect the stock to be under pressure but not encounter a downdraft.”Some dissent was offered by Mike Abramsky, of RBC Capital Markets, who said Mr Jobs’ departure added “above-average risk” to his “outperform” rating.“Investors may start to fret ‘what’s next’? Can Apple – now the largest company in tech – keep its ‘cool’ and wow factor? Can they remain unassailable?”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.6 per cent at 1,159.27, dragged down by worse-than-expected jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.5 per cent at 11,149.90.“Bank of America and Apple are just a sideshow,” Canning Smith, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, said. “The BofA deal will hopefully put banks on a more even keel but markets are trading on the macroeconomic situation right now and all eyes are on Jackson Hole tomorrow.“A note by Nomura strategists Ankur Mehta and Ohmsatya Ravi predicting an Obama administration initiative to allow government-backed mortgage holders to refinance at low rates, pushed homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.8 per cent to $4.24.Shares in online property search firm Zillow also jumped 15.2 per cent to $30.25, after the company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. Zillow defied the housing market slump to post revenue of $15.8m, up 116 per cent year on year.That was welcome cheer for tech investors, after four scheduled tech initial public offerings had been put back in recent weeks due to market volatility. Zillow is now trading well above its $20 IPO price, despite recent market turbulence.But traditional commercial property manager CB Richard Ellis was down 9.2 per cent at $13.76 on the web start-up’s success. Research in Motion was off 1.2 per cent to $28.22 after announcing a new music streaming service for its BlackBerry handsets.Verizon Communications was off 1.9 per cent at $35.77 after it announced the acquisition of CloudSwitch, a cloud software provider. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Verizon also announced it would allow businesses to process credit card payments via smartphones and tablets through an alliance with Intuit. But Intuit shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $44.62.Verizon’s competitor, Sprint Nextel, dropped 6.4 per cent to $3.23, as positive sentiment, stemming from reports the network will offer the iPhone 5 later this year, ebbed.Three companies to report earnings before the bell were among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of semiconductor parts, lost 4.9 per cent to close at $10.81 on quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents, exactly four times the equivalent figure for the same quarter last year, and 2 cents above most expectations.Hormel Foods, which sells ready-made food staples, was down 7.3 per cent at $26.36, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents a share, 4 cents higher than the same quarter last year.Patterson Companies, a medical, dental and veterinary supplies company, dropped 10.2 per cent to $26.87 after reporting quarterly earnings per share of 42 cents, 3 cents lower than the previous quarter.

In the fourth quarter, businesses spent more money on computers and storage, helping HP’s earnings and sales beat expectations.In the first earnings conference call since taking over as chief executive, Léo Apotheker provided few details of his plans except to say that software, which is only a small part of the business, will be a central theme.“With a conservative sales guidance, steadily expanding gross margins and expectations for higher operating expenses, we believe the company can pull multiple levers to beat [and/or] raise consistently through 2011,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.But rivals Dell fell 1 per cent to $13.82 and Intel lost 0.8 per cent to $21.09.J Crew Group jumped 16.8 per cent to $43.99 after the retailer agreed to be bought out by two private equity firms in a deal worth $3bn.

The $360m purchase marks News Corp’s first significant foray into the educational market.Shares in Dynegy dropped 2.7 per cent to $5.00 after it said it planned to end its agreement to sell itself to Blackstone Group because it does not have shareholder support. Blackstone declined 2.4 per cent to $12.93.Food companies Hormel Foods and Campbell Soup reported quarterly earnings Campbell Soup fell 2.4 per cent to $34.00 after it missed analysts' expectations. Profit was hit after the company deeply discounted its soups but the price cuts failed to spur sales.In contrast, Hormel Foods beat expectations sending the shares up 2.6 per cent to $49.15.Cost cuts in its refrigerated foods division and its turkey business offset rising raw material costs for its grocery products and speciality food segment. The company also raised its forecast for 2011 above

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.2 per cent to 10,151.78, lower by 1.1 per cent on the week, and the Nasdaq was 0.9 per cent lower at 2,160.09, losing 0.2 per cent over the five days.Wall Street followed global equity markets, suffering from a flight from risk sparked by weak manufacturing data from the Philly Fed and worse-than-expected US initial jobless claims figures released on Thursday. All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 slid, with energy and industrials heading the falls.Over the week, the energy sector suffered the most, losing 2.9 per cent as it followed the oil price down. Financials and industrials stocks suffered because of concerns about the economy, and mergers and acquisitions news from Intel and McAfee to BHP Billiton and PotashCorp failed to cheer investors.As the earnings season draws to a close, computer makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard reported their results after the closing bell on Thursday.Dell’s earnings and revenue came in better than expected and the technology company reiterated its full-year guidance, saying it expected demand from corporate customers to remain steady in the coming months. Dell dropped 1.1 per cent to $11.91.Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest technology company by revenue, released pre-announced results and said its strategy remained intact following the departure of chief executive Mark Hurd.

The shares fell 0.5 per cent to $15.39 after the retailer said it had increased a share buy-back plan to $400m.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, was almost flat at $43.38 after it beat earnings and revenue expectations and the company raised its full-year forecast.Marvell Technology, which makes processors for BlackBerry phones, posted a second-quarter profit in line with analyst expectations.

Ramon Ang, president and chief operating officer, said Carlyle had submitted a bid alongside food producers controlled by the Gokongwei, Aboitiz and Campos family-run groups in the Philippines.He said San Miguel would choose by Friday, but gave no details, although he said the company might agree to sell a larger stake.Mr Ang said CVC, another private equity group expected to bid for Pure Foods, had not submitted an offer by last Friday’s deadline.San Miguel holds a 99.9 per cent stake in separately listed San Miguel Pure Foods. JPMorgan is advising San Miguel on the deal.Pure Foods owns some of the country’s best-selling food brands, which have bolstered profit margins in spite of increased competition from smaller rivals and imports from China and south-east Asia. Analysts said the main challenge facing Pure Foods was how to consolidate the fragmented industry.Pure Foods contributes about 44 per cent of San Miguel’s revenues and is the Philippines’ leading producer of fresh and processed meats, poultry, flour and feed.Pure Foods-Hormel, a joint venture with US food producer Hormel Food, generates twice as much annual revenue as its nearest competitor in processed meat.San Miguel is in the middle of an ambitious strategic shift. It began in 2008 by buying half of Petron, the Philippines’ largest petrol refiner, and almost a third of Manila Electric, the country’s biggest electricity retailer.This year it bought a power plant and invested in a toll road project.The company last year sold 43 per cent of its beer business to Japan’s Kirin Holdings, whose total stake is now 48.3 per cent, for 58.9bn pesos.San Miguel’s new business lines make up about two-thirds of the group’s total assets, compared with five years ago, when food, beverages and packaging accounted for two-thirds of its assets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,350.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1 per cent to 1,989.22.Ryan Jacob, president of Jacob Asset Management, said: “Now that we are through earnings season, all the attention is on economic numbers, especially forward-looking indicators. Investors understand the jobs numbers will probably be the last to move.”But Eugene Profit, chief executive of Profit Investment Management said: “The data is probably a little bit more negative than the market seems to suggest. High unemployment remains a headwind.”Metals stocks also moved higher, boosted by commodities prices, which held on to most of the gains made during a surge in prices
on Wednesday on the back of figures showing oil inventories were surprisingly low.Nucor was up 1.2 per cent to $46.61 while rival steel maker AK Steel gained 2.7 per cent to $20.47.Worries about unemployment were exacerbated by concerns over the US consumer after results from Sears Holdings, which operates the Sears and Kmart retail chains.The company swung to an unexpected loss after failing to cut costs sharply enough to compensate for falling sales and market share. Its shares dropped 11.9 per cent to $65.Gamestop, the video game retailer, also dropped sharply after reporting quarterly earnings below what analysts expected.The company forecast continuing falling sales and said its full-year earnings would be significantly below current consensus estimates. Its shares gave up 7 per cent to $23.41.There was better news from Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear brand, after it beat estimates and raised its full-year forecast.But investors had hoped for better, after a bullish analyst call sparked a 4 per cent rise in the shares on Wednesday, and they gave back 1.6 per cent to $14.35.Two food companies also announced their quarterly results. HJ Heinz rose 2 per cent to $38.71 after higher prices for its products and lower costs helped mitigate falling sales.Meanwhile Hormel Foods, which makes Spam, also found gains with the company’s profits surging nearly 50 per cent from last year as the cost of animal feed fell. Its shares picked up 0.5 per cent to $37.44.“Even though revenues aren’t as bad as we might expect, we are still seeing the majority of profits come from expense cuts,” said Mr Profit.In the technology sector, data storage company NetApp fell 5.9 per cent to $21.55 in spite of reporting revenues and profit that were ahead of estimates.Investors avoided the shares after the company failed to provide an outlook for the rest of the year and replaced Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive, with Tom Georgens, chief operating officer.But there was optimism elsewhere in the sector after Goldman Sachs rated Google a “conviction buy”, saying it expects buoyant revenues from Europe, where growth opportunities should put the company at an advantage over some of its rivals.

37;HRL;Hormel Foods Corp;2009-08-20T13:03:12Z;Home dining boosts Heinz and Hormel;;Heinz and Hormel, the US packaged food companies, delivered better earnings than expected on Thursday as cash-strapped US consumers opted to dine at home rather than visit restaurants.Heinz said its first-quarter profits fell 6.7 per cent as the stronger dollar dented its earnings, while Hormel, the maker of Spam, saw its third-quarter profits surge on greater demand for its grocery products.Net income at Pittsburgh-based Heinz was 67 cents a share, or $213m, compared with 72 cents, or $229m in the same period last year. Holding currencies constant, profits at Heinz were up by 9.7 per cent.Revenues fell by 4.5 per cent to $2.47bn, with emerging markets such as Latin America, Russia and India blunting the decline with strong performances.“Led by strong organic sales growth in emerging markets, our sharply focused global portfolio of leading brands performed well,” William Johnson, Heinz’s chief executive, said in a statement.Heinz is most widely recognised for its ketchup and sauce brands, but as the grip of the global recession has tightened, the company has moved aggressively to take advantage of consumers who are opting to dine at home with more snacks and frozen meals.The company also raised prices by 6 per cent in the first quarter to help cope with the decline in sales volumes.“Heinz continues to invest in marketing and innovation despite this difficult economy,” said Mr Johnson.Maintaining its outlook for the 2010 fiscal year, Heinz said it expected sales to grow 4 to 6 per cent and that profits would rise 5 to 8 per cent. The company expects to have up to $900m in free operating cash flow for the year.Heinz shares rose 2.9 per cent to $39.06 in pre-market trading on Thursday. The company’s stock price is off by 26 per cent from its 12-month high.Meanwhile, Hormel, the meat company that launched Spam in 1937, continues to benefit from strapped consumers seeking greater value. The company’s net income rose 50 per cent to $77.2m, or 57 cents a share, while sales slid by 6.7 per cent to $1.57bn.Lower feed costs helped to lift the Minnesota-based company, which also benefited from strong demand for its grocery products, such as Spam and Hormel chilli, and its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment.Hormel last week lifted its profit forecast for the year to a range of $2.36 to $2.42 per share. Hormel’s stock rose 1.1 per cent to $37.64 in pre-market trading on Thursday.

The shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $39.95.NetApp also beat earnings estimates and the stock rose 3.1 per cent to $17.88. The company also announced it would buy Data Domain, its rival data storage company, for $1.5bn.

The company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear line, said cost cuts had mitigated the impact of falling sales.Hormel Foods, which owns Spam and other food products, also beat analysts’ expectations with higher profits. The company said customers were choosing to eat at home rather than restaurants, which helped stabilise revenues. The shares gained 2.1 per cent to $33.65.But Gamestop, one of the world’s largest video game retailers, gave up 15.5 per cent to $22.38 after slumping sales caused the company to miss analysts’ estimates.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned investors should not get carried away with the marginally positive signs on consumer and corporate health. “Economic growth is not as strong as the market is pricing – the retail environment is still tough, and the industrial and technology sectors are uneven,” he wrote.General Motors jumped 32.4 per cent to $1.92 after the United Auto Workers Union agreed to cut its labour costs and changed the terms of $20bn in debt for retiree healthcare."
