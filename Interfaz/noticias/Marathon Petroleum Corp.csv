0;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-02-20T11:30:01Z;7-Eleven owner in talks to buy Speedway operations in US for $22bn;Japanese convenience store company signals push to acquire overseas assets;Japan’s Seven & i Holdings is in exclusive talks to acquire Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway petrol station chain for about $22bn in an ambitious effort to grow in the US, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.If the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store pulled off the deal, it would extend a run of dealmaking that has led to Japanese companies spending nearly $100bn last year to escape anaemic growth in their domestic market. Shares in Seven & i Holdings fell almost 9 per cent on Thursday after Bloomberg first reported the talks. In a statement on Thursday, Seven & i said it was exploring “various options including partnerships and acquisitions” for its new growth strategy, but added that no final decision has been made. Marathon Petroleum declined to comment. The US oil company had already announced plans to spin off Speedway following a second activist campaign by Elliott Management that demanded a break-up of the group into a convenience store business, a midstream processing unit and an independent merchant refiner, which blends products. In October, Marathon Petroleum estimated that Enon, Ohio-based Speedway, which operates about 4,000 convenience stores in the US, had an enterprise value of $15bn to $18bn. Seven & i has already bought US assets, having spent $3.3bn in 2017 to buy parts of Sunoco’s convenience store and petrol station business. The US is central to the Japanese company’s growth strategy with its convenience stores in North America accounting for one-third of its annual revenue of $61bn. Its array of operations include grocery shops, department stores and financial services. But even for the Japanese group, which had ¥1.3tn ($11.6bn) in cash, a $22bn acquisition would weigh heavily on its balance sheet.“The strategic direction is right, but there are concerns about the large financial burden with investors worrying of a negative impact to shareholder returns,” said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager at Tokyo-based Shinkin Asset Management. Although 2019 did not have a mega-deal to match Takeda Pharmaceutical’s $62bn purchase of Shire, which was announced in 2018, there was a steady increase in both the number and size of deals as more sectors look overseas for growth. Japanese companies announced 1,271 outbound deals in 2019, with the final quarter setting a record at 354, according to Mansoor Mohi-uddin, a senior macro strategist at NatWest Markets.
1;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2019-09-25T13:47:06Z;Elliott takes stake in Marathon Petroleum and renews call for break-up;Paul Singer’s activist fund campaigns to remedy ‘chronic underperformance’ at refiner;Elliott Management, Paul Singer’s activist hedge fund, has launched a second campaign to persuade Marathon Petroleum to remedy its “chronic underperformance” by splitting into three separate entities.The $38.2bn hedge fund, which previously lobbied Marathon’s current management in late 2016, said the company should divide into a convenience store business, a midstream operator and an independent merchant refiner.The fund on Wednesday also called for a “comprehensive review” of Marathon’s governance, board and management.Elliott, which owns a 2.5 per cent economic interest in the company, said Marathon’s board failed to keep an earlier promise to seriously consider splitting off its convenience store business, and instead acquired another oil refiner, Andeavor, further expanding its conglomerate structure.In a letter to Marathon’s board on Wednesday, Elliott portfolio managers John Pike and Phillip Zeigler said “shareholders continue to suffer, prompting our letter and presentation today.”The units have “little to no synergy value” and could be better managed separately, they said.“After extensive private and public dialogue with the company [in late 2016], and to avoid the distraction of prolonged public engagement, we accepted a compromise in which the company agreed to the immediate simplification of the midstream business and a strategic review of the [convenience store] assets, including a separation or sale,” the fund managers wrote.After the company reviewed the business, it opted not to separate it. Instead, it acquired Andeavor in a $36bn deal in 2018.“While Marathon executives were telling investors that they were taking a critical look at their structure, they were in fact already contemplating and in the process of executing a massive recommitment to their failed conglomerate model,” the fund said. “Furthermore, they paid a high price to do so,” they added.The hedge fund said it sees an upside of 61 per cent in Marathon’s stock price, which would add more than $22bn in value, if it makes operational changes.Marathon said it “welcomes constructive input related to enhancing shareholder value” and would “thoroughly evaluate Elliott’s proposal.”The company added it returned about $850m to shareholders in the second quarter, and $1.2bn so far this year through share repurchases and dividends.“The company’s board of directors and management team remain focused on delivering long-term value for shareholders, and will continue to take actions to achieve that objective,” the company added in the statement.
2;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2018-05-02T04:00:43Z;Scepticism over ‘value’ comeback despite energy surge;Investment strategy gains are over-reliant on one sector, reflecting little broader shift;Energy shares were the top US market performers over the past month but the move has not been enough to renew faith that “value” investing is on the way back.The S&P 500 value index nudged ahead of its “growth” investing counterpart during April, with gains of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.But analysts were nonetheless reluctant to declare a shift in market dominance between the two diverse styles of investing — the gains in April were not supported by other key sectors considered to be classic value plays.Value investors look for companies trading at a discount to their future cash flows or break-up value while growth investing entails buying companies that offer the hope of above-average growth but often trade with a larger price tag.“Value is working but not because of any macro investor preference for cheap stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “Rather, it comes down to sentiment about energy stocks and the near-term direction of oil prices.”The energy sector gained more than 9 per cent in April to lead the S&P 500. Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
3;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2018-05-01T12:22:32Z;Marathon-Andeavor deal challenges Tesla’s electric dreams;California seen as needing steady source of petrol and diesel long into the future;If Elon Musk believes the adage that “as California goes, so goes the nation”, then the founder of Palo Alto-based Tesla may have cast a weather eye over the mega-deal between Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor.The $36bn transaction, the 11th largest in oil market history, will turn Marathon into the biggest oil processor in the US once it absorbs Andeavor’s fleet of largely West Coast-based refineries.But it comes at a time when Mr Musk and his contemporaries are trying to remake the Golden State as a test bed for an electric vehicle future, with the aim of relegating the internal combustion engine and its reliance on fossil fuels to an afterthought behind long-range batteries.California already had six EVs per 1,000 people in 2016, a ratio that will have risen since then, compared with just 0.7 in Texas.The Marathon-Andeavor deal represents a wager against some of the loftier claims of Mr Musk’s vision with “old economy” companies still believing they have a thing or two to teach the tech stars of Silicon Valley about oil’s future.It’s essentially a bet, in part, that the Californian market will not electrify as easily as the politics and culture of the state might suggestMarathon is expecting that California will continue to need a steady source of petrol and diesel long into the future with cars accounting for only a third of oil demand globally.Freight, petrochemicals, aviation and shipping comprise the rest and will not be so easily electrified.“It’s essentially a bet, in part, that the Californian market will not electrify as easily as the politics and culture of the state might suggest,” says Alan Gelder, head of refining at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.IHS Markit believes electric vehicles only reduced about 50,000 barrels a day of oil demand last year out of a near- 100m b/d market.Even if rapid EV adoption eventually does start to cut into oil demand in developed countries, Marathon is also betting other markets will open up.It believes its expanded refinery system will be well-positioned when the global shipping fleet largely switches to lower sulphur diesel in 2020, rather than the bottom-of-the-barrel poorer quality product they currently burn.US refined fuel exports to Latin America have also risen rapidly as growing fuel-hungry populations strain the continent’s often dilapidated domestic refineries.So while Mr Musk may have kick-started the mainstreaming of EVs on the west coast, refiners like Marathon are still California dreaming.david.sheppard@ft.com
4;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Merger mania whips up $120bn of tie-ups in just one day;Monday’s flurry of dealmaking takes value of 2018’s global transactions to $1.7tn;The feverish tide of takeover activity accelerated on Monday as companies confirmed more than $120bn of tie-ups, including transformational deals in the telecoms, energy and retail industries on both sides of the Atlantic.A total of a dozen transactions greater than $100m in value were announced over the 24-hour period, adding to the record clip of dealmaking in 2018, which now sits at $1.7tn, beating the pace of pre-financial crisis highs, according to Dealogic.Financial and legal advisers said the rapid rate of mergers and acquisitions is likely to continue, as companies feel emboldened by global economic growth, high stock prices and the continued availability of cheap borrowing.The deals included plans for the creation of the UK’s largest grocery chain, with J Sainsbury’s formal unveiling of a cash-and-stock deal to acquire Asda from US retailer Walmart for $10bn including debt.Meanwhile, investors reacted negatively to a planned $59bn all-stock acquisition of US wireless carrier Sprint by its larger rival T-Mobile that was announced late on Sunday, sending shares in both companies down sharply.Like the Sainsbury-Asda merger, the deal to form the second-largest US wireless group by customers underscores the willingness of powerful corporations to push through aggressive consolidation in industries where there are already just a handful of players.Executives involved in both deals used their announcements to make their case to antitrust authorities why technological disruption and a broader set of competitors meant their mergers should be cleared.“There is still a lot to do,” said Lee LeBrun, Rothschild’s head of M&A in North America. “The only thing that will stop this is an exogenous shock, or a political shock, [a risk] that has gone up. But as long as the music plays, people will keep dancing.”Mr LeBrun noted that the deal flow was accelerating despite a regulatory environment that remains uncertain under President Donald Trump, who has shown a willingness to block several mergers using tools not used by his predecessors.The latest wave of deals included Marathon Petroleum’s $36bn takeover of rival refining group Andeavor, which gave shareholders of the target the option to receive either stock or cash. The deal, which will create a US-based refining behemoth, is the biggest in the energy sector since General agreed to purchase Baker Hughes in 2016.High stock prices have enticed companies to use their shares as currency in a growing proportion of deals. Forty per cent of the deals agreed this year have included a stock component, while 14 per cent have been composed exclusively of shares, according to Dealogic. That has pushed all-cash deals to the lowest level in three years.“Notwithstanding possible trade wars, the stock market, although volatile, remains strong, and those stronger stock prices can be used as currency for acquisitions and mergers of equals,” said John Bick, global head of law firm Davis Polk’s corporate practice. “And even though interest rates have gone up . . . financing rates still remain low [enough] for companies to go out to borrow cash to do a significant acquisition.”Hernan Cristerna, JPMorgan’s co-head of global M&A, said: “If you’re in a position that the company you are acquiring could be overpriced, using your own stock is a great equaliser to make sure you’re not paying over what you would like.”Other deals on Monday included the $8.4bn acquisition of industrial real estate company DCT by warehouse group Prologis, Marriott Vacations’ $5.1bn deal to purchase timeshare operator ILG, and private equity firm Hellman & Friedman’s $3.2bn takeover of investment adviser Financial Engines.M&A boom could end in tears for shareholders / From Richard Cragg, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, UKMood for dancing is a sure sign of market exuberance / From Brian Bollen, Towcester, UK
5;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2018-04-30T17:51:13Z;Marathon/Andeavor: Refined approach;A blockbuster deal happens after an activist leaves;When the cat is away, the boss does some M&A. Marathon Petroleum has been one of the many targets of Elliott Management’s activist campaigns. In 2016, Paul Singer’s fund laid out a series of demands of the oil company that specialises in refining, transport, and petrol stations. The company mostly complied. Its shares rocketed and Elliott disposed of its stake earlier this year at a tidy profit.It is difficult, however, to imagine Elliott would be thrilled with Marathon’s purchase of rival Andeavor on Monday at an enterprise value of $36bn. True, 85 per cent of the consideration is in shares. But the deal has the hallmarks of a top-of-the-market, empire building exercise that might exercise an activist fund.Marathon should be thought of as two companies. There is a parent Marathon and a subsidiary organised as a master limited partnership. MLPs avoid income taxes but to do so must distribute most of their income out to holders. The parent that runs the MLP and the MLP itself can have a tricky, competitive relationship. Elliott advocated Marathon emphasise the value of its MLP by “dropping down”, or selling, more assets into that vehicle.Marathon followed this advice. It dropped down assets generating more than $1bn of cash flow to its MLP. It also simplified the structure of the MLP making it more investor-friendly. Between the cash it received in those sales and its portion of the MLP dividends, it returned more than $10bn in cash to shareholder in 2017.Now it is issuing a bunch of stock for Andeavor whose strength in refineries and pipelines in the Western United States complements Marathon’s in the Midwest and East. The new company, the largest US refiner, will control 15 per cent of capacity, though in widely separated regional markets. Marathon will hope the latter point mollifies US competition authorities.Marathon shares tumbled 7 per cent. The company claimed post Andeavor, it will be a “must-own refining, marketing, and midstream company”. It should hope that Elliott’s interest suddenly does not return for a fill up.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

6;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2018-04-30T11:17:33Z;Marathon Petroleum to buy Andeavor in $36bn deal;Takeover will shake-up refining industry and create largest crude oil processor in US;Marathon Petroleum has agreed to buy rival refining group Andeavor in a $36bn deal to create the largest crude oil processor in the US.The acquisition, which brings together the second-largest and fifth-largest US refiners, will create a company with more than 3m barrels a day of throughput capacity, 15 per cent of the US total and the equivalent of 3 per cent of world oil demand. Despite the significant increase in concentration in US refining, the companies said they were confident of avoiding difficulties under US competition law because the two businesses have largely different geographic footprints. Marathon operates mainly in the eastern US and Andeavor mainly in the west, with overlaps confined to Texas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.Gary Heminger, Marathon’s chief executive, said on Monday the deal would combine “two strong, complementary companies”, adding that the deal would not create market concentration in any region sufficient to trouble retailers.Marathon said it would be able to achieve synergies eventually generating more than $1bn a year in cost savings, improved procurement and crude purchasing, and other efficiency gains. Ultimate sentiment around the deal is likely to revolve around management’s ability to convince investors of the potential synergiesMr Heminger said the benefits, expected to be fully delivered by the fourth year after the deal closes, could eventually be greater but the $1bn was what he was “absolutely confident we can deliver in very short order”.The planned synergies include incorporating Andeavor’s chain of 3,200 convenience stores and petrol stations into Marathon’s highly successful Speedway chain, while retaining its regional brands.The companies also said they would be well-positioned for new rules from the International Maritime Organisation, which take effect in 2020, that will ban ships from using high-sulphur oil, creating demand for refiners that can supply low-sulphur fuel.The initial market reaction to the deal was sceptical. Marathon shares opened more than 7 per cent lower on Monday, although they quickly rebounded and by mid-morning were down about 3 per cent.Brad Heffern, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, raised some concerns about the acquisition, saying: “The synergy timeline is relatively long at three years, the deal is being done at peak refining bullishness . . . and [Marathon] is using a currency that we have seen as chronically undervalued to acquire one that we see as more fairly valued.”However, he added: “Ultimate sentiment around the deal is likely to revolve around management’s ability to convince investors of the potential synergies.”Marathon operates seven refineries in the Midwest and on the US Gulf Coast. Andeavor, which was known as Tesoro until 2017, has eight plants primarily on the west coast. Under the deal, Andeavor’s equity would be valued at $23.3bn, while the enterprise value including debt would be $35.6bn. Both boards have approved the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of this year.Greg Goff, Andeavor’s chairman and chief executive, will join Marathon as executive vice-chairman once the deal closes, the companies said.Shareholders of Marathon will own approximately 66 per cent of the combined company while Andeavor shareholders will hold 34 per cent, with the deal representing a 24.4 per cent premium to the latter’s closing share price on Friday.Refining stocks have been on a tear with Marathon hitting an all-time high last week, up 120 per cent in the past two years. Andeavor has gained 44 per cent over the same period and also hit a record high on Thursday. US refiners in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast have benefited from the surge in US shale oil output this decade, which has pushed US crude oil prices to a consistent discount versus international benchmark Brent.US refineries have been stepping up exports in recent years, which has allowed them to lower input costs while still largely getting higher international prices for the fuels they produce.Refining margins have also been strong as the drop in crude oil prices since 2014 helped stimulate global demand, which is growing at roughly double the pace it was when crude was above $100 a barrel.Andeavor’s plants on the west coast have benefited less from this trend, however, as California, the largest market for its fuels, has more stringent fuel specifications than the rest of the US. It is also more reliant on imported crude, with few easy ways available for transporting oil from the shale fields in Texas and North Dakota. Marathon Petroleum was advised by Barclays and law firm Jones Day, while Andeavor was advised by Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell.
7;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2017-05-08T03:31:28Z;Dakota pipe lenders under pressure to withdraw;Trump approval renews campaign to reroute project;A number of banks funding the controversial $3.7bn Dakota Access Pipeline have pulled out of the project, following environmental and human rights concerns from the public and big investors that it would contaminate drinking water and damage sacred burial sites of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.In March ING, the Dutch bank, sold its $120m loan to the oil pipeline and divested its $220m shares in Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company leading the project construction. BNP Paribas, the French bank, followed suit and sold off the same size loan in April. The loans make up part of the $2.5bn credit line funded by 17 banks.Scandinavian banks and asset managers have added their weight. DNB, the Norwegian bank, cut its involvement in the pipeline, which runs from North Dakota to Illinois.“By selling our stake we wish to signal how important it is that the affected indigenous population is involved and that their opinions are heard in these types of projects,” says Harald Serck-Hanssen, group executive vice president at DNB, via a statement on the bank’s website.The bank’s asset manager, DNB Asset Management, divested from the companies behind the pipeline last November, while Nordea, the Nordic bank, banned its fund managers from investing in the companies building the pipeline. Nordea’s decision came after Donald Trump, US president, decided to continue the disputed project, in January. The pipeline starts transporting oil in May.Odin Fund Management, the Norwegian asset manager, and Storebrand, a sustainable investment manager in Norway, have also divested.Many of the sell offs come after a group of more than 130 investors, led by Boston Common Asset Management, sent a letter to the banks in February requesting a reroute of the 1,100-mile pipeline away from the Standing Rock Sioux territory. They highlighted the reputational damage and potential legal risks of financing the pipeline. The number of investors has since risen to over 160, representing $171bn assets under management.“It’s a big reputational risk for banks. We think it is significant if banks and asset managers divest from the pipeline. It sends a strong message to ETP and other companies building the pipeline,” said Lauren Compere, managing director and director of shareholder engagement at Boston Common Asset Management.A new study from MSCI ESG Research highlights the risks involved. Its controversy assessment ranks two of the main companies involved in the pipeline construction - Energy Transfer Partners and Energy Transfer Equity - as “very severe”, giving each an ESG rating of CCC. The rating is based on the scale and seriousness of the environmental and social impact of the pipeline and the risk to a vulnerable population.Other companies involved in the pipeline such as Sunoco Logistics, Enbridge Energy Partners, Philips 66 and Marathon Petroleum were classed as “severe” on the controversy assessment level.“The divestment process shows what active investors can do against companies violating human rights,” says Antonios Panagiotopoulos, an energy analyst at MSCI, who compiled the research. He warns that “banks that buy the loans, which are being sold, also risk reputational damage.”Meetings between the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, banks and asset managers have played an important part in the decision to divest, as well as the recent UN Special Rapporteur’s report on the rights of indigenous peoples. It found the Native Americans had not been properly consulted about the pipeline route. Since the report was published, KLP, the Norwegian pension fund, has also divested because of “an unacceptable risk of contributing to human rights violation.”Some banks and investors prefer the engagement route to divesting. This includes Calpers, the California pension fund, which is a signatory to the letter. “If you sell your shares you lose your influence. Some of the banks we’ve engaged with have sold off or issued statements about their concerns,” says Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance at Calpers.Calstrs, the California teachers’ pension scheme, has also opted for direct engagement with banks and stakeholders. Calstrs says it opposed the original proposed bill in the California state assembly requiring a divestment from the companies building or financing the project.This process shows what investors can do about human rights violationsThe AB 20 Bill, which was amended in April, no longer calls for divestment but requires state pension funds to list investee companies, explain how engagement has been carried out and whether it has been successful, by 2018. The boards of Calstrs and Calpers will meet to discuss the amendments.Citigroup, the US bank leading the loan syndication, outlined its continuing engagement with the construction companies and stakeholders in its reply to the investors’ letter, but says “a reroute of Dakota Access Pipeline does not appear to be feasible at this late stage of construction”.Wells Fargo, another lender bank, faced a shareholder vote at its AGM on April 25 on a resolution to improve and clarify its policies to protect indigenous peoples. Earlier this year Seattle City Council cut its ties with Wells Fargo over its loan to the pipeline.Ms Compere believes the “whole process with First People’s rights is a big lesson for banks”. However she wants to see more banks responding to investor calls for discussion with stakeholders and a rerouting of the pipeline. “Shame on those banks that have not come to the table,” she says.
8;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2016-11-22T13:25:01Z;Marathon Petroleum: tough breaks;Much of what Elliott demands is already likely to happen;Activists operate in the gap between what owners want and the — presumably — divergent aims of management. Sometimes the benefit of intervention is clear, in other cases not so much. Elliott Management has this week brought Marathon Petroleum of the US into its sights, and now owns 4 per cent of the shares. Elliott is right about the need to simplify Marathon’s structure. But it is not obvious that management has failed shareholders.Marathon Petroleum is not to be confused with its former sibling Marathon Oil, the exploration and production company. The two split in the summer of 2011 when oil prices were high. The current focus of Elliott’s attentions ended up with two refineries and a service station business known as Speedway. It also created a US-listed master limited partnership (MPLX) to hold its pipeline and processing assets, retaining less than a quarter of its shares. These partnerships have US tax advantages as long as they distribute enough income to unit holders.Elliott’s beef concerns the relationship between Marathon and MPLX. It claims to have no issues with the other businesses. Yet it is not immediately clear what the problem is. While both Marathon and MPLX have trailed their respective peers over the past year — partly due to weak US refining margins — their longer term relative performance is good. Bowing to pressure, Marathon management has promised to sell off midstream assets to MPLX over the next two or three years. Elliott applauds that, but wants a faster timetable, with all assets sold at once and the whole company then split into its three divisions.Putting aside the pros and cons of master limited partnerships — tax wheezes, dressed up as infrastructure investments — Elliott has a point. Marathon’s structure is overly complicated and inefficient. An accelerated sale of all Marathon’s midstream assets, paid for with MPLX units, would give Marathon majority control of MPLX. This would enable the consolidation of its cash flow and result in a higher valuation for the entire group, thinks Morgan Stanley.Yet Marathon does not look obviously undervalued compared with other refiners. Refining is the division that represents most of Marathon’s profits. Elliott has pushed hard on an open door. Marathon has not let down its shareholders. Its conglomerate structure needs fixing, that is all.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
9;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

10;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2016-11-21T19:15:13Z;Elliott urges Marathon Petroleum to speed up restructuring;Activist investor claims oil refiner and retailer could boost value by 80 per cent;"Elliott, the US activist hedge fund, has taken control of a 4 per cent stake in Marathon Petroleum and urged the company to accelerate its restructuring, saying that the process could boost its valuation by 80 per cent.Its proposal is the latest move to reconfigure the US oil and gas pipeline sector, which has been hit by concerns about a slowdown in growth as a result of weaker prices and environmental objections to new construction.Marathon Petroleum, which operates refining and pipelines businesses and is the second-largest fuel retailer in the US, last month announced plans to sell more assets to MPLX, its affiliated partnership, in which it holds a 24.9 per cent stake.But Elliott has argued that the timetable for these sales is too slow, and said Marathon should also look at splitting off its refining operations from its retail business.According to the activist fund, the market valuations of both Marathon and MPLX have been undermined by uncertainty over the pricing of the proposed asset sales, and investors’ inability to grasp the true worth of the group’s operations because of its complex structure.Quentin Koffey, a portfolio manager at Elliott, has now written an open letter to Gary Heminger, Marathon’s chief executive, saying: “We believe the opportunity at Marathon is unique, both in the amount of value that can be unlocked and how readily it can be achieved by the board.”Mr Koffey’s letter and an accompanying presentation posted on Elliott’s website present a two-stage plan: first, complete the “drop down” sales of all Marathon’s remaining pipelines to MPLX; then conduct a full strategic review to look at spinning off either the retail chain or the refineries.Mr Heminger, who has been in contact with Elliott for months, issued a statement saying he agreed with Elliott that there was “upside to our valuation,” but added that the company was already addressing that “with the value-creating actions we announced last month.”He added: “We disagree with their letter and presentation.”On October 27, Marathon said it would sell all of its remaining directly-owned pipeline assets to MPLX “as soon as practicable within the next three years”. That move was backed by Jana Partners, another activist hedge fund that holds an 0.8 per cent stake in the group.Elliott, however, argues that the assets should be sold “immediately”, to clear up investors’ concerns about the pricing of the deal. It also suggests there would be tax benefits from completing the sales quickly, and delaying for three years could cost Marathon shareholders $750m-$900m in tax penalties.Marathon denies that there are any such tax costs to moving more slowly.Initial market reaction suggested some support for Elliott’s argument that uncertainty had been depressing the valuations of Marathon and MPLX. News of the fund’s approach raised Marathon’s shares by 5.8 per cent to $45.81 by early afternoon on Monday, while MPLX shares rose up 2.5 per cent to $33.81.Mr Heminger said in his statement that Marathon Petroleum had “a strong and longstanding track record of taking aggressive actions to increase shareholder value” since it was split off from the upstream exploration and production company Marathon Oil in 2011. It has generated total shareholder return of 140 per cent over that period, compared to 86 per cent for the S&P 500."

Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.6 per cent to $46.59 a barrel.Oil prices tracked gasoline and diesel prices higher as the leak in the pipeline, which carries refined products from the biggest refining centre on the US Gulf coast to the biggest population centre on the US east coast, is only expected to be repaired over the weekend.“[The] Colonial pipeline leak has been bullish for East Coast gasoline,” said Aaron Pauker at RBC Capital Market.Shares in Marathon Petroleum climbed 4.5 per cent to $43.74, Valero Energy rose 3 per cent to $56.19 while Baker Hughes climbed 1.6 per cent to $49.18.Thursday’s gains took the sector’s year-to-date advance to 11.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology climbed 1.7 per cent, driven by a rally in shares of Skyworks Solutions and Apple, the world’s most valuable company. Shares in Skyworks Solutions, which supplies chips to the iPhone maker, jumped more 6.4 per cent to $77.02.Apple, the world’s most valuable company, climbed 3.4 per cent to $115.57 — its shares have now advanced for four straight days, adding more than $60bn to its market valuation.Thursday’s advance took the gains in the technology sector to 1.5 per cent so far in September, leaving it the only sector in the green for the month.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 1 per cent to 2,147.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 1 per cent to 18,212.5, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 5,249.7.Elsewhere, US tyre manufacturer Goodyear Tire and Rubber rallied on Thursday after the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 43 per cent.Shares in the Boston-based company climbed 5.1 per cent to $32.39 after the company said it would increase its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share as part of a plan to return up to $4bn to its shareholders.Meanwhile, shares in Global Payments rose 3.4 per cent to $76.05 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the payment technology company to “buy” from “neutral” and raised their price target on the stock to $88 from $80, citing three key catalysts for the move.First, the upgrade was driven by analysts’ expectations that the company’s revenue growth could exceed 10 per cent over the next two years, ahead of consensus forecasts.Second, James Schneider, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, also said synergies from Global Payments’ $4.3bn acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems “are likely to exceed investor expectations”.Lastly, he noted: “We believe Global can benefit from industry consolidation, resulting in more benign pricing and lower churn.”mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The share was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 index.The fall comes off the back of fourth-quarter earnings reported this morning. The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, beating expectations of $1.09. But disappointing revenues have set the tone for full-year 2017 earnings that are yet to come. Revenues missed analysts’ forecasts of $1.82bn, coming in at $1.79bn.The restaurateur revised 2017 earnings down to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share, when analysts were looking for $3.99 per share.“These results reinforce our firm belief that our strategy is working as we continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy,” said Gene Lee, the company’s chief executive. “This focus, together with our competitive advantages, drove our strong performance for the year and increased shareholder value.”On the other end of the spectrum, Hershey’s, the American chocolatier, is the subject of a takeover bid from Mondelez International. The news resulted in trading in Hershey shares being temporarily halted after a sudden rise of over 7 per cent just after 10:30am in New York. Hershey’s was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 index, up 16.8 per cent to $113.49, helping push the consumer staples sector up 2.2 per cent.Molson Coors also saw its share price rise after the brewer, known for beers such as Amstel and Carling, issued bonds on both sides of the Atlantic in recent days.The company was the first to issue in the US after the Brexit vote last week. It secured a low coupon on its debt as yields across investment-grade bond indices and benchmark US Treasuries have been falling.The brewer’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $101.13, responding to the bond deals, which will probably be used to fund its full takeover of MillerCoors.After strong gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the rally in the energy and materials sectors in the S&P 500 index slowed marginally, gaining 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, as Brent crude dipped 1.8 per cent to $49.68.Murphy Oil saw earlier gains in the week pared back, falling 0.8 per cent to $31.75. Noble Energy dropped 1.2 per cent to $35.87, while Marathon Petroleum gained 1.9 per cent to $37.96.Chesapeake, the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, led the sector’s pullback, down 3.2 per cent to $4.28, after the company announced that its retirement plan was in partial termination following a more than 20 per cent reduction in the company’s workforce over the past two years.On the day, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 2,098.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,930, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.3 per cent to 4,842.7.

US data showing falling crude inventories helped oil prices rise, with some analysts also pointing to a potential strike in Norway — the largest crude oil producer in western Europe — as contributing to the rally.Murphy Oil, an oil and gas exploration and production company, helped lead the sector’s rebound, rising 6.4 per cent to $32.01.Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refinery in the US, rose 4.4 per cent to $37.26. Noble Energy gained 3.5 per cent to $36.31.It was a different story for Texas-based Southwestern Energy. Its stock price fell 6.2 per cent on Wednesday to $13.03, the worst performance across the S&P 500 index, after the company offered 75m common shares to the public.The company intends to use proceeds from the stock offering to repay $375m of debt. Its share price rose by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after extending maturities and tweaking conditions on more than $2bn of outstanding credit.The financials sector also had a strong rally, rising 2.3 per cent. The sector had been hard hit after the UK’s vote to leave the EU and was braced for the release by the Federal Reserve of bank’s stress test results on Wednesday evening.Utilities also made gains after initially lagged behind the broader stock market rally, rising 0.3 per cent. The sector typically performs well when investors are defensive, making its underperformance indicative of some renewed risk appetite.Elsewhere, Nike, the sports clothing and equipment brand, saw its stock price bounce 3.8 per cent to $55.13, having fallen by more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following a mixed earnings report.Nike reported profits of 49 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 48 cents a share. But the focus turned to underwhelming revenues growth, which rose 6 per cent to $8.24bn, below the market’s target of $8.28bn.“We remain bullish on both secular and structural tailwinds for Nike’s business,” said analysts at Stifel. “Stiffer [currency] headwinds and a more volatile macro picture, however, leave us slightly more cautious on near-term fundamentals.”Rival sporting goods producer Under Armour rose 5.9 per cent to $39.75, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 index.Alcoa, the metals producer, outlined plans for its split into two companies, hiving off mining, refining and smelting from the more profitable materials production business that serves transportation and construction industries.The announcement sent the company’s stock down 2.5 per cent to $9.10. The spun off company will retain the Alcoa name, while the remaining assets will begin trading under a new name of Arconic.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 2,070.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6 per cent to 17,694.7 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.9 per cent to 4,779.3.

The dollar also gave up ground after rallying in recent days, supporting commodities.Traders and strategists were nonetheless cautious on the rebound in stocks, warning that while the losses of the past two days were extreme — the S&P 500 lost nearly $1tn of value in Friday and Monday’s rout — more volatility was likely ahead with the second-quarter ending on Thursday.“It is just simply a technical rebound in response to a very sharp sell-off,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “I have been cautioning people that it is probably shortlived and we may see a pullback.”Traders also said a covering of short sales contributed to the move higher on Tuesday.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent to 2,036.09 while the Nasdaq Composite was 2.1 per cent higher. The CBOE’s Vix, a measure of implied volatility for the S&P extended its drop and fell below 20 — its long-term moving average.“The Vix pulling down toward 20, stabilisation in European equity markets and . . . stabilisation in gold or oil [are the right signs],” Mr Frederick said. “But you need a few days before you say there is an opportunity here.”Among energy companies, ExxonMobil rose 2.3 per cent to $90.91 while Devon Energy gained 6.6 per cent to $35.99 and Marathon Petroleum was up 8.4 per cent at $35.70.Bank stocks, which have been hard hit over the past few sessions, also rose on Tuesday. The financials sector of the benchmark index added 2.5 per cent with Citigroup up 5.1 per cent at $40.44, Bank of America adding 4.3 per cent to $12.70 and JPMorgan gaining 3.3 per cent to $59.52.Banks have been pressured as market participants have dialled back tighter interest rate policy expectations from the Federal Reserve in the wake of Brexit and ensuing market turmoil. Sharply lower US Treasury yields worry investors as low rates squeeze margins for banks.Technology shares also rebounded on Tuesday after coming under recent pressure given their natural cyclicality and exposure to Europe. Microsoft was up 2.1 per cent to $49.44.Utilities companies were the laggards, up just 0.3 per cent. As the broader market sold off, utilities had outperformed due to expectations of lower interest rates remaining for an extended period. In spite of selling on Tuesday, high dividend paying companies such as utilities are expected to remain in favour.Meanwhile, Lending Club, the embattled peer-to-peer lender, gained 7.2 per cent to $4.61 on news that it would cut its staff by 12 per cent. The group has also named a new chief executive after the departure of Renaud Laplanche in May over allegations of loan mis-selling and an undisclosed personal interest in a fund. However, an ongoing review, whose results were revealed on Tuesday, found that there had been further improprieties at the company.
15;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2016-06-12T10:22:16Z;Oil majors find virtue in integration;Slump in crude prices highlights benefits in owning upstream and downstream businesses;He was reporting record losses amid a prolonged industry downturn, and facing a big shareholder revolt against his 20 per cent pay rise. But Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, did manage to find one bright spot amid the gloom at the company’s annual meeting.“Not so long ago I used to hear a lot of advice about how we should separate out our downstream business and sell it off,” he told shareholders in April. “I don’t hear that so much any more.”Mr Dudley was reflecting what executives at the largest energy companies have been saying for the past year or so: that this downturn, the worst in 30 years, has vindicated the business model of the “vertically integrated” oil groups. These companies combine the upstream activities of finding and developing oilfields with downstream functions such as refining crude and selling petroleum products.As in many other industries, oil companies have been facing growing pressure to become more focused. However, since the collapse in crude prices began in mid-2014, that pressure has gone into abeyance. Low prices have crushed profits from oil and gas production, but helped refining and chemicals businesses, supporting integrated groups’ earnings.Yet while the questions over the value of integration may have eased off for a while, they are unlikely to have disappeared for good.There are two principal benefits from being an integrated company. One, in the words of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is that it “captures the highest value for every molecule that flows through our facilities”.As he explained it to analysts in March, Exxon can adjust its production to serve the most profitable markets.“We react more effectively and rapidly to changes in the business environment,” said Mr Tillerson. “Our global supply organisation utilises sophisticated demand planning and marketing tools that provide insights to achieve the best value for our upstream production.”The second professed benefit of the integrated model has come into focus during the oil slump: that owning both upstream and downstream businesses creates a hedge against a drop in the price of crude.In 2014, Royal Dutch Shell generated $16.5bn in profit from its upstream operations and $6.3bn downstream. The following year, the balance flipped: upstream earnings slumped to just $1.8bn, while downstream profits remained roughly flat, adjusting for one-off items.John Abbott, Shell’s head of downstream, says: “The business is very cyclical. Sometimes value will be in the upstream . . . sometimes it will be in the downstream. I’ve lost count, to be honest, over the last 35 years, how many times that has happened.”Weak oil prices helped refiners last year as crude fell faster than the value of refined products, boosting margins. BP reported average refinery margins of $17 a barrel last year, up 18 per cent compared with 2014.For more than 20 years, both of those putative benefits derived from integration have been challenged.Advocates for break-up accepted downstream profits could provide stability during an oil price slump, but argued the costs of the added complexity outweighed the benefits.They also pointed out physical integration — companies refining their own crude — was dwindling. Frederic Choumert of Roland Berger suggests most large international companies might run only 20 per cent of their production through their own refineries.The financial crisis subdued those break-up calls for a while, but as markets recovered the pressure re-emerged. In 2011, researchers at Oppenheimer argued large US oil groups could raise their valuations 20 per cent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations.A few US companies acted on those recommendations. Marathon Oil spun off its downstream operations as Marathon Petroleum in 2011, and ConocoPhillips did the same with Phillips 66 in 2012.Under pressure from Elliott Associates, an activist investor, Hess sold off its terminals and pulled out of refining in 2013, to focus on production.At first glance, the slump in oil prices since 2014 might seem to have made those moves look rash. In the past two years, Hess shares have dropped by 34 per cent, Conoco’s by 41 per cent and Marathon Oil’s by 61 per cent.But adding in the performance of the spun off refining businesses, the break-ups do not look like big mistakes. The weighted average total shareholder return for Conoco and Phillips 66 since the 2012 split, including dividends, has been 40 per cent. Over the same period. Chevron’s total shareholder return has been 12 per cent and Exxon’s 18 per cent.Mr Choumert argues if oil companies want to remain in upstream and downstream activities, they have to show investors there are real advantages to the model, whether in terms of scale and financial strength, or in physical integration.Some companies have been responding to those concerns. BP has restructured its US downstream operations, selling two refineries, to focus on those that are closely linked to its marketing businesses.Tufan Erginbilgic, BP’s head of downstream, says: “We are trying to create differentiated business models so we can generate differentiated returns . . . Then we are not going to have one good month for the company and another month not good.”Some companies are even expanding their downstream operations. Total is planning to get involved in building more liquefied natural gas terminals and power plants, to drive demand for the gas it produces.None of this, however, means the argument for splitting up vertically integrated companies has gone for good, not least because refining margins have slipped back again this year.Occo Roelofsen, a senior partner at McKinsey, which has published multiple papers in the past advocating break-up, says the argument looks weaker now.“The debate has shifted because large companies have improved their performance and lowered their costs during the downturn more than we thought,” he says.Mr Choumert, however, thinks there will still be pressure for change, especially at smaller integrated companies such as Repsol of Spain.“I would not be surprised if there is a move made on them to try to get them to realign their business.”The arguments over what segments of the oil value chain belong in the same company stretch back more than 150 years.John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil took control of the US oil business in the 1870s by dominating the refining and transport industries, which gave him leverage over the fragmented production companies, but it was not initially a significant producer.Standard subsequently acquired more wells, and by the end of the century accounted for 32 per cent of US crude output, according to Ron Chernow in Titan, his magisterial biography of Rockefeller. Even so, Standard’s position in the upstream industry was always weaker than its grip on refining and transport. At the time of its break-up in 1911, it owned 70 per cent of US refining capacity, but only 14 per cent of its crude productionIn the 1950s and 60s, when the cartel of large western companies known as “the seven sisters” controlled the global market, owning the entire value chain helped them maintain their dominance.In the 1960s and 70s, though, the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and North Africa took control of their industries with a series of nationalisations. Western companies were forced to range further afield in search of reserves, to Alaska, sub-Saharan Africa and central Asia, and as they did so their refineries became increasingly distant from their wells, according to Richard Forrest of AT Kearney.The emergence of a truly liquid global spot market for crude in the 1980s made it less important for companies to lock up supply chains internally to ensure reliable flows of crude. Physical integration — companies processing their own crude in their refineries — went into decline.

Oil and gas producers are big winners on the index this year, up 12 per cent — propelled by higher energy prices.Oil is on track for its biggest monthly gain in seven years with both West Texas Intermediate and Brent, the international benchmark, up over 20 per cent in April.Prices have rebounded from below $27 per barrel in the early weeks of the year — a 13-year low — on hopes that falling US production will help counter the ongoing oversupply and high crude oil inventories.Exxon, the world’s fourth-largest company by market capitalisation, released first-quarter results on Friday. Revenues were down 28 per cent while earnings fell 63 per cent year on year.The declines were less than expected and shares rose 1.9 per cent to $89.77, before closing up just 0.5 per cent at $88.45. Exxon’s shares were already up this week, despite the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s of the company to AA+.Market sentiment did improve when the US major showed restraint in increasing its dividend by just 3 per cent, the smallest rise in nearly a decade.In contrast, Chevron doubled expected losses. The US’s second-largest oil group reported a first-quarter after-tax loss of $725m.Its shares traded down 1.8 per cent to $100.61, closing 0.1 per cent down at $102.33.

17;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2016-01-27T13:04:45Z;Oil producer Hess reports first FY loss in 13 years;;The decision by Hess to exit its refining and gas station businesses to become a pure play oil and gas producer looks increasingly ill-timed.The New York-based company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines and losses as the collapse in global crude prices battered sales, forcing it to take a $1.35bn impairment charge on its assets. The company’s loss widened to $1.8bn for the final three months of the year from $8m a year ago, after revenue tumbled 45 per cent to $1.38bn.The quarter takes Hess’s total loss for 2015 to over $3bn, compared to a profit of $2.37bn in 2014. This is the company’s first annual loss in 13 years.While energy companies around the world have been hard hit by the 72 per cent drop in crude prices since June of 2014, some have been able to lean on their “downstream” refining business to help stem some of the bleeding from its “upstream” oil exploration and production unit.This is not the case for Hess however. Under pressure from activist shareholder Elliot Management, the company announced plans to exit its refining business in 2013 to focus on what was then the more profitable work of exploring for and extracting oil and gas. It followed up a year later with the sale of its iconic gas station chain to Marathon Petroleum for $2.87bn.Hess has subsequently used the proceeds to focus on shale oil production in the Bakken. The company bought 34 gross operated wells on production in the fourth quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 219 wells.Net debt totalled $6.6bn at the end of 2015, compared to the company’s market capitalisation of $9.8bn.Shares in Hess, down 50 per cent over the past 12 months, fell 1.3 per cent in pre-market trading.
18;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2015-12-16T19:10:31Z;End of US oil export ban brings only light relief;Domestic producers to compete for foreign markets for first time since 1970s oil embargoes;Washington lawmakers’ agreement to end 40-year-old restrictions on US crude oil exports provides some cheer for beleaguered energy companies as prices sit near their lowest level in seven years.The move will eventually allow domestic producers to compete for customers overseas for the first time since the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s.But the world should not expect a flood of American oil anytime soon.Energy markets have changed since legislators first took up the cause of US producers suffering extreme price discounts for their crude. What was a domestic glut brought on by soaring shale oil production has spread overseas, with strong output from other countries building up global inventories as well.“You would be selling crude oil from the United States into a globally saturated market,” says Sarah Emerson, principal at ESAI Energy, a research group.That means that the clamour heard for US oil almost two years ago has quieted. West Texas Intermediate crude of the US now sells for about a dollar less than international benchmark Brent, a spread that hardly makes it worthwhile to ship cargoes from Texas to Europe, for example.Congress authorised the export ban in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo led to queues at petrol stations. At the time, crude export restrictions were needed to effect an economic policy that included price controls. But when price controls were abolished, the ban survived.As the US imported ever more crude, the ban for years was irrelevant for energy policy specialists. But as energy companies began to tap shale oil, imports fell sharply. The light, high-quality barrels extracted from regions such as Texas and North Dakota had difficulty finding enthusiastic buyers among oil refineries configured to digest heavier grades.Earlier this year, WTI’s discount to Brent was briefly more than $10 a barrel, prompting shale producers such ConocoPhillips and Continental Resources and their lobbyists to redouble their push to overturn the ban.The ban is porous: crude may be exported to Canada with a licence, for example, and the Obama administration in the past two years has also liberalised trade with Mexico and in an ultralight oil known as condensate. Through these avenues, US oil exports earlier this year rose as high as 600,000 b/d — more than the output of Ecuador, an Opec member.Michael Wojciechowski of consultants Wood Mackenzie says that in near future, allowing crude exports will probably redraw the map of destinations for US crude away from its near neighbours rather than boost overall volumes.“It might actually be a while before you see a net new barrel exported from the United States,” he says. “We are exporting barrels to eastern Canada and Mexico. What’s going to happen in the first instance is an optimisation of those exports.”Shares of US oil and gas exploration and production companies fell 2.4 per cent as WTI futures lurched down 4 per cent to $35.71 a barrel at midday in New York.In the longer term, the congressional agreement could be bad news for US refiners that have enjoyed fat profit margins by processing relatively cheap US crude into petrol and diesel sold at global prices.However, refinery investors seemed unbothered by the deal on Wednesday, with shares of Valero and PBF Energy each up 1 per cent. The legislation includes a tax credit for independent refiners, some of which are disadvantaged by another law that requires coastwise shipments of US crude to sail in more expensive US tankers.Oil producers were buoyant. John Hess, chief executive of Hess, a midsized independent US oil producer, says the decision “would have far reaching benefits for our country”, adding jobs, boosting investment in the US industry, and enhancing global energy security.Many Democrats had initially questioned the need to overturn the ban, raising concerns it would raise petrol prices and potentially increase greenhouse gas emissions as lower prices stimulated more consumption.Environmental groups reacted with fury to the lifting of the ban.Jason Kowalski of 350.org, which campaigns on climate change, calls the decision “political cowardice” and says: “This is a good reminder that, when left to their own devices, politicians will still cave to the power of ExxonMobil and their partners in crime.”For the package to win support from Democrats in Congress and from the Obama administration, it had to include extensions of tax credits for wind and solar power as well. The administration has said it opposes liberalisation of crude exports, but President Barack Obama is not expected to veto the bill on those grounds.US oil output has been in retreat since a peak of 9.6m barrels per day in April as producers slashing drilling campaigns in response to the plunge in crude prices. It is not clear that life without an export ban will do much to stimulate additional production, as the oil industry and environmentalists have argued. Under its reference case, Energy Information Administration economists concluded that allowing unfettered exports would not add any barrels of production by 2025.Jim Burkhard, vice-president of IHS, a consultant, says lifting the export ban would nevertheless embolden producers as they ponder future investment.“For US crude oil producer, that would remove a layer of uncertainty about price,” he says. “It would be a boost to confidence.”Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington

However, the stocks lagged behind the broader market from 1985 to 2002 at a challenging time for commodity investment.Valuations are currently in line with the S&P 500, compared with the 1990s commodities downturn, when they traded at a 20 per cent discount to the S&P 500.Mr Revich and his team downgraded shares of heavy equipment maker Terex Corp to “sell” from “neutral” because of a weak outlook for global crane demand. Shares of the company fell 3.7 per cent to $20.69.Shares of Navistar International fell as much as 7.6 per cent to $16.32, after analysts cut the stock to “sell” from “neutral”, arguing that a turnround at the truckmaker “is on track” but that used truck prices have softened. Navistar, however, pared its losses to trade 2.5 per cent lower at $17.22.Agricultural equipment maker Deere nabbed an upgrade to “neutral” from “sell”, with analysts citing strong equipment pricing and lower raw material costs. But Deere shares slid 1.3 per cent to $91.25.The S&P 500 machinery index, which is down 7 per cent so far this year, fell 1 per cent.Mylan shares fell 14.5 per cent to $56.37, after Teva Pharmaceuticals abandoned its attempt to take over the company and instead agreed to buy a generic drugs unit from Botox-maker Allergan in a deal valued at just over $40.5bn.Teva shares advanced 16.5 per cent to $72.07 in New York, while Allergan shares gained more than 6 per cent to $327.20. Meanwhile, Mylan said it was pushing ahead with a plan to buy competitor Perrigo.A 2 per cent drop in Brent crude, the international oil standard, to $52.95 a barrel and a more than 1 per cent drop in West Texas Intermediate, to $46.99 a barrel, weighed on energy stocks.The S&P 500 energy index fell 1.4 per cent, with shares of Marathon Petroleum leading the decline, falling 3.3 per cent to $54.46.US stocks followed global markets lower on Monday, with energy and material stocks leading the decline on the benchmark S&P 500.The S&P 500 slid 0.6 per cent to 2,067.64, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 17,440.59.

Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 2.1 per cent to $43.36 while shares of American Airlines gained 2.9 per cent to $42.42.Shares of Marathon Petroleum rallied 7.9 per cent to $58.78 after the company said its master limited partnership, MPLX LP, an owner of oil pipelines, would buy natural gas processor MarkWest Energy Partners.The combined company would have a $21bn market valuation and would be the country’s fourth-largest master-limited partnership. Shares of MarkWest Energy gained 13.8 per cent to $68.01 while shares of MPLX LP fell 14.5 per cent to $59.03.US stocks bounced on Monday as eurozone leaders reached an €86bn deal on a Greek bailout.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,099.60, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 17,977.68 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.5 per cent to 5,071.51.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
21;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2015-07-13T14:08:28Z;MPLX buys US gas pipeline group for $17bn;Deal for MarkWest shows confidence in prospects for shale production;MPLX, a US oil pipeline company, has agreed to buy the gas processing and pipeline group MarkWest valued at about $17.4bn including debt, in the latest of a wave of deals to have swept through the industry over the past year.News of the deal sent MPLX’s units plunging by mid-morning in New York trading, down about 16 per cent to just under $58, reducing the value of the stock and cash deal significantly.Buying MarkWest reflects MPLX’s confidence in the continued growth of gas production in the northeast US, including the Marcellus Shale centred in Pennsylvania and the Utica shale centred in Ohio. MarkWest is the leading gas processor in that region.It is also the latest sign of the pressure for master limited partnerships— the tax-privileged structures adopted by MPLX and MarkWest — to increase investors’ payouts through acquisitions.MLPs, which are typically oil and gas infrastructure businesses, usually pay out most of their free cash in distributions to investors — and often project rapid growth in the size of these distributions.To support their projected growth rates, they need to add new assets, whether by organic means — such as building new pipelines — or through acquisitions.MPLX’s deal would create the fourth-largest such MLP in the US. Five of the six largest oil and gas deals announced in the US over the past 12 months have involved MLPs, according to Dealogic.They include the move by Kinder Morgan to roll up its complex group structure, including three MLPs, into a single company that is structured as a conventional corporation.Williams has similarly bid about $14bn to buy up the remaining units of Williams Partners, its affiliated MLP, but that deal faces an obstruction from an alternative plan proposed by Energy Transfer Equity, which is seeking to buy Williams for about $48bn but retain Williams Partners as a separate MLP.Energy Transfer Partners, ETE’s MLP affiliate, also earlier in the year agreed a $17bn deal to buy another related MLP, Regency Energy Partners.MPLX said that buying MarkWest would enable it to meet its objective of raising its cash distribution to investors by 29 per cent this year and by 25 per cent in each of the next two years.Gary Heminger, MPLX’s chief executive, said the deal “creates a tremendous platform for the combined partnership to continue to grow distributable cash flow”.However, MPLX is now dropping its earlier projection that it could achieve annual growth in distributions in the “mid-20s” of per cent in 2018 and 2019.Mr Heminger also suggested there would not be large immediate cost savings from the deal. “There will be some over time,” he said on a call with analysts. “But this is not driven off of cost synergies.”MarkWest has plans for capital spending of $1.5bn per year over the next five years as it develops new facilities, which MPLX said “provides a clear path to the growth in distributable cash flows of the combined partnership”.However, the deal initially drew an unenthusiastic reaction from the markets, with MPLX units — which MLPs issue instead of shares — falling about 13.1 per cent to $60 in morning trading.MLPs are no longer just collecting tolls. Some are drilling, gathering and processing oil and gas, businesses fully exposed to falling prices. The most exotic MLPs mine fracking sand or make nitrogen fertiliser, both hard-to-hedge commodities.Continue readingMPLX was spun out of Marathon Petroleum, the refining group, in 2012, and its parent still owns 46 per cent.The latest deal is being structured as an acquisition of MarkWest by MPLX, even though the acquirer is roughly half the size of the target in terms of market capitalisation.However, MPLX’s units have a higher rating, with a historic yield of just 2.4 per cent before the deal was announced, compared with 6.1 per cent for MarkWest.The offer is 1.09 MPLX units plus $3.37 in cash for every MarkWest unit, giving a total value of $65.94 based on Monday morning’s trading price. That represents a 10 per cent premium to MarkWest’s last closing price on Friday.Marathon Petroleum contributed $675m to the deal to cover the small cash component.MPLX was advised by UBS and Jones Day, MarkWest by Jefferies and Cravath, Swaine & Moore.
22;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2014-12-03T09:02:58Z;US refineries run flat out to process cheap crude;The US industry takes advantage of falling oil prices and a flood of shale supply;"US highways grow visibly emptier as winter weather sets in. Traffic volumes decline, as does petrol consumption.Tell that to oil refiners. The US industry is processing record amounts of crude for this time of year, taking advantage of falling oil prices and a flood of supply from shale drillers. “They’re running refineries as hard as they can,” says John Auers, executive vice-president at Turner Mason, an energy consultancy in Dallas.Refineries’ hearty appetite has kept the price of high-quality “light” US crude closely in line with international prices, defying warnings that a glut would force deep discounts. Light Louisiana Sweet, the US Gulf coast benchmark, this week sold for just a dollar less than the international Brent benchmark, suggesting solid demand for it.Government policy has also helped maintain strong crude runs, emboldening refiners who argue that Washington should keep in place longstanding restrictions on oil exports. Under a four-decade-old law, shippers are free to export refined petroleum products but not crude.“The bottom line remains that we haven’t seen an oversupply of light crude,” says Jamal Kheiry, spokesman for Marathon Petroleum, an independent US refining company. “We believe the industry will continue to make investments and keep up with increased production.”The amount of oil purchased by refiners in the US will be an important guide for world oil markets, which have cut prices to $70 a barrel because of surging output in the US and the Opec cartel’s unwillingness to cut production. Refiners are by far the dominant customers for crude, which is largely unusable unless processed.In the week to November 28 gross inputs to US refinery distillation units were 16.554m barrels a day, the highest figure for any November week on record, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Refineries ran at 93 per cent of capacity.16.554mGross inputs (of barrels per day) to US refinery distillation units in the week to November 28 – the highest figure for any November week on recordThe US refining system has several advantages over competitors shuttling fuel around the Atlantic Ocean, says James Fallon, a director at the consultancy IHS. The first is access to cheap natural gas used to power refineries’ energy-intensive operations.The second is that US refiners can buy crude at a price cheaper than many global rivals, thanks to production increases from shale and rising imports of heavier oil from Canada.Third, many US refineries are close to docks that allow them to sell freely abroad. Net exports of refined petroleum products now total 2m b/d, a reversal of the US’s historic role as an importer.Domestic demand for fuel has been tepid since the financial crisis, but that is also now set to change. The winter slowdown notwithstanding, drivers are returning to roads in numbers last seen in 2008 and are again buying gas-guzzling vehicles.“The F150s [a Ford pickup model] and the SUVs are flying out of the dealers’ showrooms these days,” says Charlie Drevna, president of American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a refiner industry group. “You can’t put the spouse, the Rottweiler, the hockey equipment and the kids in a Smart car.”If production continues to grow . . . you will get to a day of reckoning when you can’t consume the crudeWhether US refineries and their neighbours in Canada – which is exempt from crude export restrictions – succeed in absorbing the rising oil tide is a preoccupation for oil traders and analysts.US crude oil production surpassed 9m b/d in recent weeks. Next year, the Energy Information Administration forecasts output will average 9.42m b/d.“If production continues to grow and you still limit the ability to export crude, you will get to a day of reckoning when you can’t consume the crude,” Mr Auers says. He believes this day will dawn in the next year or two, when production tops 10m b/d.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingDebate over whether to allow unfettered exports of US crude has intensified this year. Recent studies, including those by the Brookings Institution and the US Government Accountability Office, found allowing exports could spur higher crude production at home, weaken oil prices abroad and in turn reduce petrol prices for US consumers, since they are mainly steered by international markets.Refiners are investing to take advantage of cheaper US shale oil and suggest they have the capacity to handle the rising volumes. For example Valero, the largest US refining company, plans to add crude units in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas designed to process oil from the nearby Eagle Ford shale. Overall US refining capacity is about 17.8m b/d, up about 400,000 b/d from two years ago.“American refiners are doing a good job of handling all the domestic production,” Valero says."
23;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2014-11-06T17:31:15Z;Refiners: sweet gig;Oil price plummet need not mean they are undervalued;Leery of buying the dip in oil explorers? There may be a better opportunity downstream – among US oil refiners. Being a refiner based in America has been a (light) sweet gig in recent years. Production of crude is at record levels. Due to a ban on exports and the challenges in moving oil around the country the supply glut has made this crude cheaper, relative to the global oil price. Yet the price at which refiners sell gasoline and other refined products is based on the higher global price – creating a nifty arbitrage. Over the past five years, the shares of three big US refiners, Valero, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum, have at least doubled, beating the S&P 500. But the recent plummet in oil prices worldwide have made them trickier to evaluate.Third-quarter earnings for the US refiners were strong (even ExxonMobil and Chevron were bolstered by their refining segments). But the question is where the spread between the global benchmark Brent and the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate heads. In September, that differential essentially disappeared but it has since widened to $6. Most analysts believe the spread will enter 2015 at between $8 and $10 with WTI in the mid-$80s and Brent in the low $90s.Looking only at oil price spreads ignores company-level complexities. Oil refineries are located across the US. Certain regions, most notably the “mid-Continent” and Gulf coast, have the easiest access to cheap US crude. Refiners also produce not just gasoline but petroleum-based chemicals. Most interestingly, in recent years some refiners have spun out their oil storage and pipeline assets into master limited partnerships, trying to take advantage of the appetite for yield. Barclays believes that the refiners are undervalued because these other segments are ignored. Refiners may trade as much as 50 per cent below their intrinsic value.Look for the refiners to play up that discount as worries grow about the end of the crude export ban.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
24;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2014-06-25T17:00:54Z;US refiners hit by Pioneer’s export move;;US oil refiners fell by their greatest rate in more than two and a half years after a Texas company was given permission to export very light oil from the US, circumventing traditional refiners.The private decision for Pioneer Natural Resources could open the door to unrefined crude export for the first time since the 1970s, analysts said.Under current law, export of unrefined crude oil and condensate produced from oilfields is not allowed. However, once that oil has been refined into another fuel – such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel – it can leave the country.The news that oil producers could export a type of oil that is lighter than regular crude depressed shares of refiners and sent the S&P Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing Index to its biggest one-day decline since 2011.Valero tumbled 8.29 per cent to close at $51.35, Phillips 66 slumped 4.21 per cent to $81.36 and Marathon Petroleum fell 6.34 per cent to end at $80.97.Analysts with Wells Fargo warned that the sharp pullback could be overdone as condensate demand and the size of initial exports, which are expected to begin this summer, are unknown.“We recognise that this will shake confidence in the refining outlook but this is not the end of the road, in our opinion – just an anticipated bump,” analyst Roger Read said.“Unfettered crude exports will require an act of Congress and the political will for that is undeveloped at this point.”The decision lifted independent oil producers, including those drilling in Eagle Ford and Bakken shale of Texas and North Dakota.Shares of SM Energy rose just over 6 per cent to $84.96, Pioneer advanced 5.15 per cent to $233.07 and Rosetta Resources climbed 5.25 per cent to close at $53.69.US broadcast networks were boosted by a Supreme Court ruling that found streaming television service Aereo violated their copyright in a decision that safeguards a key revenue stream for the companies.Broadcast networks – including CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC – earn some $4bn a year from so-called retransmission fees from cable distribution companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Dish.A win for Aereo would have allowed cable distributors to follow its model of using tiny antennas to capture over-the-air television and redistribute it for free.June 2014: Michael Mackenzie discusses with Gregory Meyer how sectarian violence in Iraq coupled with high oil consumption in the US may affect the markets.The retransmission fees, which research firm SNL Kagan forecasts will rise to $7bn in coming years, have become a backbone for revenue at the networks.CBS, which is the largest US standalone broadcast network, rose more than 6 per cent to $62.48.Walt Disney shares advanced 1.48 per cent to $83.90, Twenty-First Century Fox rose almost 2 per cent to $34.88 and Comcast, which owns NBC, climbed more than 1 per cent to $53.21.Shares of Monsanto, the world’s largest maker of genetically modified seeds, climbed just over 5 per cent to $126.73 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and said it planned a new two-year $10bn share buyback programme.The company also announced a goal of doubling annual earnings by 2019 on the back of strength in its core seeds business and new big data offerings.Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller fighting fires both in its brick-and-mortar and digital businesses, said on Wednesday that it will split its Nook and retail divisions into two separate companies.“We have determined that these businesses will have the best chance of optimising shareholder value if they are capitalised and operated separately,” chief executive Michael Huseby said.The split is expected to take place in the first few months of 2015. Its shares rose 5.3 per cent to $21.65. Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, holds a minority stake in the Nook business.Overall, US equity markets advanced despite a report that showed economic activity contracted at a worse than expected 2.9 per cent rate in the first three months of the year.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.49 per cent to close at 1,959.53 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.29 per cent higher to 16,867.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.68 per cent to end the day at 4,379.76.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
25;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2014-01-12T17:37:54Z;Oil refiners: Sweet surrender;Crude export ban should be lifted along with other measures of energy protectionism;US oil production is about as fast these days as the US government is slow. Nevertheless, momentum is steadily building, both politically and commercially, to allow domestic crude to be marketed abroad. And it presents a good opportunity to review other regulations that distort the energy supply chain.The export ban, instituted in the days of the 1970s Arab oil embargo, has now created a market distortion where domestic crude prices have diverged from the global one. And that has been wonderful news for US refiners who acquire that cheap US crude and then sell refined products such as diesel around the world at prices set by that higher global level.US oil production is expected to grow to more than 9m barrels a day by 2015. Gulf Coast refiners such as Valero, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 now benefit from the recent split between the falling Light Louisiana Sweet crude and the global Brent prices. JPMorgan believes there will be a medium-term gap of $10 between another US crude oil benchmark, WTI and Brent. The bank said last month that would boost the value of its US refiner universe by a third. Nice work if you can get it.So it is unsurprising that Valero and other refiners will oppose lifting the export ban (though others such as Phillips 66 are supportive). Supporters of the ban say it lowers prices at the pump. However, US petrol usage remains tepid while exports of refined products have rocketed to almost 3m barrels a day, double 2006 levels.So instead of vainly losing the fight on the crude exports, refiners would be wise to broach reform of the Jones Act, another form of protectionism. The Jones Act forces shipping between US ports to be handled by domestic vessels and crews. As such, refiners on the east coast face transport costs of perhaps double or triple what a foreign ship would command. If the refiners do not deserve favoured status from Uncle Sam, neither do shippers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
26;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2013-10-10T23:12:53Z;US eyes cutting ethanol usage;;The US would ratchet back its ethanol consumption mandate for the first time under a proposal that would ease costs for oil refiners and cool demand for farmers’ corn.The White House is considering a plan to require 15.21bn gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into motor fuels next year, well below the 18.15bn mandate dictated by Congress.The proposal, outlined in draft documents seen by the Financial Times, comes almost six years after lawmakers passed the mandate in an attempt to wean the US from foreign oil and back income for corn belt states.This policy crashed into the unexpected reality of weaker fuel consumption and an oil industry reluctant to sell petrol containing more than 10 per cent ethanol, making the targets unachievable in a problem known as the “blend wall”.The Environmental Protection Agency’s preferred option would hit not only Brazilian sugarcane growers, who export ethanol to the US, but for the first time cut required volumes of ethanol refined from corn. Less than 13bn gallons of corn ethanol would have to be sold under the draft proposal, below levels in force in the past two years and well below the 14.4bn statutory mandate for 2014.This would hit US ethanol refiners, such as Archer Daniels Midland and Poet as well as the farmers who sell them 35 per cent of the nation’s corn crop.EPA has sent its draft proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review and has not released it for public comment. The agency, largely closed owing to the federal government shutdown, did not respond to requests for comment.A September 6 document indicates EPA plans to invoke powers to declare “inadequate domestic supply” as a way to justify the deviation from the congressional mandate. The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuels lobby group, said this would be “patently unlawful”.“There is no basis to suggest that the strict criteria for a general waiver are met today,” said Bob Dinneen, RFA president.The renewable fuel and oil sectors have been at war with one another over the biofuels mandate, even as fuel retailers need some ethanol to meet emissions and octane requirements.Oil refiners’ shares responded positively to reports of the proposal. Valero, which also runs ethanol plants, closed 4.7 per cent higher, while HollyFrontier was up 6.1 per cent, Marathon was up 5.2 per cent and Phillips 66 was up 2.9 per cent.The American Petroleum Institute argues that the law’s requirements should be waived for next year on the grounds that because of the limit to ethanol use set by the blend wall, the mandate would cause “severe economic harm,” including “significant increases in the cost of fuel and substantial fuel supply shortages in the United States”.Patrick Kelly of the API said if the reported EPA proposals were confirmed, “directionally they’re doing the right thing, although we just think they could have gone a little further”.Jason Bordoff of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy said that if the figures were confirmed, he would expect a sharp fall in the price of the biofuels credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, used by fuel suppliers to meet their regulatory obligations.“This potential reduction is more than what many in the market were expecting,” he said. “Industry could comply with these renewable fuel obligations without the incentive of a high RIN price to build out E85 infrastructure or produce more biomass-based diesel.”
27;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2013-02-08T17:08:34Z;US crude exports argument needs refining;;President Barack Obama wants to double US exports. Will these include crude oil?This question, absurd until recently, is becoming serious. The US may still be a huge crude importer but rises in domestic supplies are shutting out millions of foreign barrels. This week the head of the International Energy Agency – a group that looks after western nations’ energy security – pointedly warned the US oil boom will end if Washington fails to lift its ban on most crude exports.And Lisa Murkowski, the senior Republican on the Senate energy and natural resources committee, declared: “All agencies should review policies affecting energy exports and remove unnecessary impediments. Energy exports are good for our economy.”The impending fight could overshadow current arguments over US exports of liquefied natural gas. Politicians, businesses inside and outside the energy industry and environmentalists will join the fray – with high stakes for investors.Exports would shuffle the boom’s winners and losers. Refiners, the weaklings of the oil patch a few years ago, have reaped windfalls buying oil at depressed US prices and processing fuel for sale at higher international prices. In the past two years the S&P 500 refining and marketing index, composed of stocks such as Valero and Marathon Petroleum, had total returns of 90 per cent.The companies drilling the oil have not been so fortunate. Daily US crude production has risen by 1.3m barrels in the past two years, reaching a 19-year high of 6.9m barrels a day. Yet shares of exploration and production companies lost 2.4 per cent.Most new output is high-quality, low-sulphur crude from states such as North Dakota and Texas. Many US refineries are set up to process heavier, lower-quality crude. Others sit far from pipelines so can be served only by costly trains and US-flagged tankers.“It may make sense to export a certain type of oil that you don’t have refinery capacity in a locality to be able to use,” says John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group whose members include Chevron and Exxon Mobil.Refiners see it differently. They say they are adjusting to handle the new supplies. At Valero, high-quality sweet crude used to be a third of its feedstock, a spokesman says. Now it’s about half. To capture some of the stunning output from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, Valero built a truck terminal at its nearby Three Rivers refinery. It plans to buy 2,000 railway tank cars this year to collect more cheap inland crude.It has also received permission to export some US crude to a Valero refinery in Quebec, Canada. But the spokesman suggests untrammelled US exports would be a bad idea: “It actually makes more sense to keep the oil here and refine it at a low cost and then export products.” Valero has been central to the US’s emergence as a top global diesel and petrol exporter.Exports of crude are much more politically sensitive than products. Shipments are effectively blocked to everywhere but Canada. But the restrictions, which date to the late 1970s, were irrelevant until now.Maria van der Hoeven, IEA executive director, argued in the Financial Times that the US needs to loosen export restrictions lest weak oil prices force drillers to give up on exploration.This seems improbable. Producers in North Dakota have found customers in states as far away as New Jersey despite high delivery costs. An easier fix to the refinery mismatch might be to let cheaper foreign tankers carry oil to the east coast.Further, environmentalists will argue, selling extra light crude abroad will simply feed demand for the heavier – and from a global warming perspective, more dangerous – oil poised to flow on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada.But there is another reason why enabling crude export makes sense, says Bill Reinsch, former undersecretary for export administration at the US Department of Commerce. The US is leaning on allies to stop buying Iranian crude amid sanctions over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. “It’s hard to tell them, ‘Don’t buy from Iran,’ and then deny them an alternative source,” Mr Reinsch says.The arguments are still at a crude stage.

28;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2013-01-27T18:56:42Z;Refiners reap gains of US shale oil boom;;The US refining industry has been enjoying a remarkable revival thanks to the shale boom, making shares in companies such as Marathon Petroleum and Tesoro the best-performing of any large energy companies worldwide last year.In a sign of how shale oil and gas production is reshaping the global industrial landscape, refining has become more internationally competitive in the US, enabling it to export record volumes of oil products such as diesel fuel.An analysis published on Monday by PFC Energy, a consultancy, shows that in 2012 shares in US refiners rose by between 57 and 105 per cent, making their strongest recoveries since the collapse in oil prices and refining profit margins in 2008-09.The leading US refiners report full-year results this week and they are all expected to report strong gains with analysts forecasting earnings per share up 40 per cent at Valero Energy, 44 per cent at Tesoro and 63 per cent at Marathon Petroleum.The foundation for the revival in US refining has been the shale oil boom, made possible by advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that have unlocked previously inaccessible reserves.Onshore production in states led by North Dakota and Texas has opened a wide gap between prices for inland US oil and internationally traded crude.On Friday night, international benchmark Brent crude was about $113 per barrel while US West Texas Intermediate at Cushing, Oklahoma, was about $96 and at Midland in west Texas was cheaper again at about $88.Refiners that can secure supplies of those cheaper crudes have a competitive advantage, both increasing their margins in the US and making them more competitive in export markets, particularly in emerging economies such as Mexico where – unlike in the US – fuel demand is still growing.“The entire structure of the US refining industry has been turned on its head,” says Robin West, of PFC. “Up until recently, oil was imported, refined on the coast and then transported inland. Now the crude is being produced inland and sent to the coasts and it’s a goldmine for the refineries that have access to it.”Inland refineries closer to the new production have been the principal beneficiaries. Shares in Dallas-based HollyFrontier, which has refineries in Kansas, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah, more than doubled last year.However, coastal refineries have also been able to secure cheaper supplies, sometimes by reversing the flows of pipelines – as with the Seaway pipeline which once took oil from Texas to Cushing but now goes the other way– or by moving oil on trains.Phillips 66, the refining, pipelines and chemicals group spun off from ConocoPhillips, said last year it was planning to buy up to 2,000 rail tank cars to take cheaper inland crude to its refineries on the coastThe wider distribution of cheap crude has meant that even Valero, which has half of its refineries in the Gulf of Mexico region, has benefited.US refiners have also been helped by the cheap price of natural gas – another result of the shale boom – which is a big input cost for refineries.Problems including the fire at Chevron’s Richmond refinery in California and an accident at new facilities owned by Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco at Port Arthur, Texas, also helped by keeping capacity out of the market.US refiners’ shares have not generally regained their peaks in the boom of the mid-2000s, sometimes known as “the golden age of refining”.From their highs in 2007, Tesoro’s shares are down about 30 per cent while Valero’s are down 50 per cent.Set against a patchy performance for the global energy industry last year, however, their record is particularly impressive.PFC’s analysis of the world’s 50 largest energy companies by market capitalisation shows shares in the US companies producing shale oil and gas had a mixed year, hit by weak natural gas prices.EOG’s shares rose 20 per cent but Devon’s fell 18 per cent. The largest western oil groups’ shares were flat or down slightly while national champions PetroChina and Gazprom were down 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.With the US oil boom continuing, the refining industry’s strength seems set to continue, for a year or two at least.However, Mr West warns that, as new refining capacity comes on stream, profitability will come under pressure.Chi Chow, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, agrees. “There are eight new hydro-crackers for diesel planned to come on stream in the US and Europe,” he says.“You’re going to see the tight supply-demand balance that there has been for diesel start to loosen. Margins will flatten and potentially start to decline.”In this perennially cyclical industry, even if the shale boom persists, the boost it gives to refiners may not last too much longer.
29;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-10-12T13:36:42Z;Letter from Lex – popular uprising;A week featuring anti-aircraft and anti-bank weapons;This week resembled a popular uprising featuring anti-aircraft and anti-bank weapons. The German government shot down a deal to create a world-beating European aerospace and defence company leaving EADS’ long-term strategy in tatters. Then Walmart and Amex unveiled their anti-bank weapon, a service providing lower income households with an alternative to debit cards and current accounts. Greek citizens could do with a similar service as their banking sector has been whittled down from six to three players. In the UK, Barclays made another bolt-on acquisition in the form on ING’s lossmaking online bank as regulators simultaneously eased capital requirements in an effort to stimulate lending and the economy. The move came as the IMF estimated that tighter regulation will see European banks’ total assets fall by $2.8tn by the end of next year.Other companies were also feeling the sting of European regulators. Google offered to put clear labels on its own services in an attempt to appease them while UPS may have to offer significant remedies if it is to complete its €5.2bn takeover of TNT Express. Elsewhere the news was about phones, cars and resources.Japanese telecoms company SoftBank is in talks to acquire a $12.8bn stake in the US’ third largest mobile operator. But Chinese telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE may soon be barred from doing business in the US after a Congressional committee said they posed a threat to national security in a move that smacks of protectionism. In the automotive sector, Toyota issued its biggest single vehicle recall to date as European carmakers still showed no signs of reducing the region’s 35 per cent production overcapacity. In the mining sector, the complex web of debt-ridden businesses and governance mishaps that is Bumi looked like it might finally put investors out of their misery. In the oil & gas sector, BP sold its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum for $1.8bn as the CEO of the world’s biggest oil producing company, Rosneft, dangled the keys to the Arctic Ocean and the Kremlin before the eyes of western investors. Scotland may be relying on the oil & gas sector if it achieves independence in its 2014 referendum, but many Scots may be dismayed to discover that any Tartan index would be far more dependent on the financial sector.John Casey, Lex Publisher
30;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Marathon/BP – bargain purchase;Downstream has trounced the upstream guys;No one likes to be upstream without a paddle. But investors are learning to love being downstream. Marathon Petroleum’s purchase on Monday of the Texas City refining complex from BP offers some sharp evidence. The buyer was part of Marathon Oil, until it split its upstream and downstream operations into separate companies in 2011. That experiment worked – the combined market capitalisation of the new companies is more than $40bn, twice what the parent was worth when it split. Downstream has also trounced the upstream guys this year – its shares are up 75 per cent against zero for upstream.That is at least partly explained by the fact that the split has left Marathon Petroleum free to expand in a refining sector that upstream has never much liked. In fact, the refining business is flourishing (relatively) in the US, where margins are more robust than in Europe because of the big domestic market and a concentration on high-value products such as jet fuel.Marathon is paying $1.8bn for the Texas City plant and inventory. That is a big discount to what BP received when it sold its Carson City refining complex in California to Tesoro in August. That involved a smaller plant (266,000 barrels a day of refining capacity compared with 475,000 at Texas City) but it fetched a similar price. That may reflect the tragic recent history of Texas City – an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 people. BP has had this sale on its to-do list for a while.The purchase looks a bargain for Marathon given that BP has spent $1bn turning Texas City into one of the most modern refineries in the US. Marathon already has a plant in Texas City refining 80,000 b/d, so BP’s plant will give it more heft. The company forecasts that it can wring pre-tax earnings synergies of $440m from the plant up to 2017. Given Marathon’s record, that looks eminently achievable.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
31;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-10-08T17:47:01Z;BP sells Texas City refinery for $2.5bn;;BP is to sell its Texas City refinery and related assets to Marathon Petroleum Corp for $2.5bn, a price that disappointed analysts but brought the company within striking distance of a $38bn target for asset disposals to cover the costs of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.The deal closes a painful chapter in BP’s history. The plant, in Texas, was the site of an explosion in March 2005 that killed 15 people.The Financial Times reported last month that BP was in talks with Marathon to sell the refinery, the third largest in the US.BP said the sale price of $2.5bn included $600m in cash and $1.2bn for inventories. The deal also contained a so-called “earn-out” provision, under which Marathon could pay an additional $700m over six years, subject to certain conditions.Marathon will also acquire Texas City’s associated natural gas liquids pipelines and four marketing terminals in the US southeast. BP will also assign Marathon contracts for gasoline sales to about 1,200 retail sites in four southern US states.The news sent shares in Marathon to a record high of $60.04 in New York on Monday.Peter Hutton of RBC Capital Markets called the price BP had secured “disappointing”, especially when compared to a deal in August to sell its Carson refinery in California to Tesoro for $2.5bn. On the basis of that transaction, he had expected Texas City to fetch $2.3bn, excluding inventory or pipeline rights.“But at the end of the day, the difference between what they got and the top of the range of our estimates for what it’s worth is just 5p a share,” he added.He said BP had tried to manage investors’ expectations downwards at its second-quarter results, when it wrote down the value of its US refining assets.A person close to BP said the price was “decent” considering the plant’s “troubled history” and the fact that for several years it was not profitable.The deal brings the total value of divestments BP has agreed since the beginning of 2010 to more than $35bn. It is targeting a total of $38bn by the end of 2013.Marathon Petroleum was formed last year when Marathon Oil split its upstream and downstream segments into two separate companies. It is now the fifth-largest refiner in the US, with six plants. It already has one 80,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Texas City.BP acquired Texas City when it merged with Amoco in 1998. The refinery can process 475,000 barrels a day and employees 2,150 BP staff.The 2005 blast at the plant occurred when a unit used to distil gasoline and boost its octane content was overfilled, releasing flammable liquid that then exploded.In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony charge of failing to have adequate maintenance procedures and paid a $50m fine.The company invested more than $1bn in upgrades to Texas City. But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the US federal overseer of workplace safety, still hit the group with an $87m fine in 2009. Much of it was for its failure to fix safety hazards similar to those that caused the 2005 explosion.In August 2010, BP settled with OSHA, paying it $50.6m and promising to spend $500m on safety improvements.In a statement, Texas City’s manager Keith Casey said the refinery had been transformed in the past few years through a “resolute focus on safe, compliant and reliable operations” and had in recent months returned to profitability. “It does not, however, fit with the long-term strategic direction of BP’s global refining portfolio,” he said.Gary Heminger, Marathon Petroleum’s chief executive, said Texas City “complement[s] our current geographic footprint and align[s] well with our strategic initiative of growing in existing and contiguous markets to enhance our portfolio”.
32;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-09-26T18:22:28Z;Regulatory reforms for oil market quashed;Iosco abandons efforts for more oversight;What is better: a relatively transparent but unregulated market, or an opaque but regulated one? Perversely, that was the dichotomy that watchdogs faced as they tried to impose the first set of rules in the physical energy market.The physical oil market – the territory of trading houses such as Glencore and big oil companies such as BP – is totally unregulated. The overall market only knows the price of commodities such as diesel in north-west Europe and Brent oil because several price reporting agencies, including Platts, a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill, gather data about bids, offers and trades and, using their proprietary methodology, publish prices in what otherwise would be opaque markets.When the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, an umbrella of regulators, suggested rules about how those benchmark prices were calculated, it received the threat from the industry of a price blackout.In a draft of its final report to the G20, set to be approved next week, Iosco says that if it had carried on with its regulatory ideas, it would have resulted in “some market participants to decrease or even to cease their submission of data”. If oil companies and traders had carried out that threat, the energy physical market would have become impenetrable to everyone but a few powerful insiders.The threat of a regulated but far more opaque energy market forced regulators, including the UK Financial Services Authority and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, into a rare – and reluctant – climbdown. The retreat came in spite of an acknowledgment by Iosco in its final draft that the status quo “creates the opportunity to manipulate the commodity market” and a warning that the potential for misconduct in the oil market “is not mere conjecture”.The draft highlights several cases of attempted manipulation of benchmarks in the physical market, including one notorious case in which Energy Transfer Partners, a US-based pipeline company, paid $10m to the CFTC to settle allegations of attempted manipulation of the physical natural gas market. In another instance, Marathon Petroleum, the US-based oil company, settled charges in 2007 of attempting to manipulate the Platts’ assessment of the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price, paying $1m to the CFTC.“The cases cited in this report involving incidents of false reporting to influence derivatives trading illustrate that the potential for such misconduct is not mere conjecture,” the draft states.The climbdown should be a wake-up call for the G20 about the lack of oversight in the physical commodities trading industry. The main problem remains that watchdogs have no power over the sector. As the CFTC said in an internal memorandum: “We …were dealing with a totally unregulated physical oil market, where there are no requirement on any participants”. If the G20 really wants to start exercising some oversight over the sector, it needs to provide its regulators with some teeth.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times

Shares in Marathon rose 2.3 per cent to $53.28.The S&P 500 energy index overall has risen 6.8 per cent since the start of the year, ranking it as the second-worst performing sector group, and has fallen 2.4 per cent this week.Meanwhile, the fall in oil prices helped to bolster shares in several airline companies. Delta Air Lines rose 4.4 per cent to $9.35, United Continental Holdings climbed 7.4 per cent to $20.69 and US Airways Group gained 6.5 per cent to $10.98.US equities on the benchmark US index finished 0.1 per cent higher to 1,451.05, ending two consecutive days of losses. The S&P 500 has gained 16.2 per cent since the start of the year.Homebuilders were among the day’s best performing stocks after fresh data released on Wednesday showed the housing market continued to gain momentum.Existing home sales in August rose to their best level in two years, according to figures released by the National Association of Realtors. Elsewhere, commerce department data showed that new construction of single family homes last month was growing at its fastest rate since April 2010.The data helped to lift shares in homebuilders. PulteGroup was 4.3 per cent higher at $16.43, DR Horton gained 4.1 per cent to $22.22 and Lennar Corp rose 1.9 per cent to $36.26.Consumer discretionary stocks were the steepest risers on the day as the sector index, which includes several homebuilders, rose 1 per cent.JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said: “There’s a lot of excitement surrounding the latest housing figures that has contributed to a slow, creeping rally among stocks on the S&P 500.”“Going forward, it will be interesting to see if the index can hold these levels,” he added.Financial sector stocks fell 0.1 per cent as shares in Goldman Sachs lost 0.7 per cent to $119.02. The global investment bank announced late on Tuesday that David Viniar, its longtime chief financial officer, would retire and be replaced by Harvey Schwartz.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “David was instrumental in navigating Goldman Sachs through the financial crisis and into a much more financially sound company today, and thus, this is as good a time as any for David to pass the baton.”Shares in Blackstone, the asset management and private equity company, declined 0.9 per cent to $15.10. The company late on Tuesday said it would buy a controlling stake in Vivint, a home security provider, for $2bn.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,577.96.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2 per cent to 3,182.62. Shares in Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker, closed slightly higher at $702.17 as customers await the first shipments of its latest smartphone. The company’s shares are up 73.4 per cent since the start of the year.Facebook shares continued to gain momentum and rose 6.5 per cent to $23.29. The social networking site’s shares have climbed 32.7 per cent since touching their intraday low earlier this month. Still, Facebook shares remain 38.7 per cent below their May debut price of $38.Groupon shares gained 13.9 per cent to $5.34 after a report said the daily deals company would provide merchants with a new payments service. Shares in Groupon have lost more than 74 per cent since their initial public offering last December.

36;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-09-18T21:03:32Z;BP in talks to sell Texas City refinery;;BP has held talks to sell its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest stage of a big asset disposal plan to cover the costs of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.While it is unclear if a deal will be reached, one person familiar with the matter said BP and Marathon had been in talks for months. A sale could raise up to $2.5bn, a second person said.The sell-off would close a contentious chapter in BP’s history. Texas City, the third largest refinery in the US, was the site of an explosion in March 2005 that killed 15 people.A deal would bring BP a lot closer to its target of $38bn in disposals by the end of 2013. The company, which is facing a trial in the US for gross negligence over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, has raised $32bn from asset sales since the disaster.BP has been in talks with other parties on Texas City: as recently as July, Valero, the US refiner, said it had “looked” at the plant. BP and Marathon declined to comment.Refining in the industrialised world has been hit by over­capacity and the economic slowdown, which has weakened demand for petrol, and several big oil groups have sold off downstream assets.BP announced in February last year that it was selling Texas City, which can process 475,000 barrels of oil a day, as well as its Carson refinery in California – in effect halving its US refining capacity. The company sold Carson last month to Tesoro for $2.5bn. In July, BP said it was in “advanced discussions” on Texas City and was on track to announce its sale by the end of the year.Marathon Petroleum was formed last year when Marathon Oil split its upstream and downstream segments into two separate companies. It is now the fifth largest refiner in the US, with six plants. It already has one 80,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Texas City.The blast at BP’s plant occurred when a unit used to distil gasoline and boost its octane content was overfilled, releasing flammable liquid that then exploded.In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony charge of failing to have adequate maintenance procedures. It paid a fine of $50m – the largest assessed against a company to date for violating the US Clean Air Act.BP invested more than $1bn in upgrades to Texas City. But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the US federal overseer of workplace safety. still hit the group with an $87m fine in 2009. Much of it was for its failure to fix safety hazards similar to those that caused the 2005 explosion.In August 2010, BP settled with OSHA, paying it $50.6m and promising to spend $500m on safety improvements.Marathon Petroleum shares, which fell 2.9 per cent on Tuesday, rose 3.2 per cent to $30.31 in after-hours trading.Additional reporting by David Gelles
37;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US hurricane threat raises petrol prices;;US petrol prices leapt as tropical storm Isaac churned across the Gulf of Mexico, forcing refineries to batten down operations at a time of declining stocks of fuel.Wholesale petrol prices gained as much as 4.1 per cent to $3.2050 per gallon, the highest level since April, as Isaac was forecast to arrive as a hurricane in states from Louisiana to western Florida early Wednesday. The storm is the biggest threat to Gulf energy infrastructure since hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.Isaac could escalate a late-summer rise in petrol prices and encourage Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to step up attacks on White House energy policy in his campaign against Barack Obama, US president.It also increased odds for the release of crude stocks from the US strategic petroleum reserve, JPMorgan analysts said. Retail petrol prices averaged $3.776 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration, up noticeably in recent weeks but below the spring peak.As the storm neared, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 were respectively shutting down refineries in Garyville and Belle Chasse, Louisiana. Chevron’s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi was operating but the company said it was monitoring the situation. The Gulf coast is home to more than 40 per cent of US refining capacity.The fuel price jump was exaggerated by a fatal weekend explosion which damaged the 950,000 barrels-per-day Paraguana refining complex in Venezuela, the world’s second largest after the Jamnagar complex in India. Gulf Coast spot gasoline fetched about 28 cents per gallon more than futures for October delivery, the Oil Price Information Service said.The accident prompted Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company, to seek gasoline in the Gulf market, said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates, a consultancy.Isaac has also forced companies such as BP, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell to shut down about 333,800 b/d of crude oil output in the Gulf, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.“Although we’re going to lose Gulf of Mexico oil production during the storm, we’re going to lose a far greater amount of refining capacity. As a result that means demand for crude oil goes down but refined product supply remains tight,” Mr Lipow said.In London, Brent crude oil was down 1.1 per cent to $112.30 per barrel, while in New York crude was 1.2 per cent lower at $94.93 at midday.The US National Hurricane Centre on Monday said Isaac was packing winds of near 65mph, or 100km/h, and warned of storm surges as it arrived in gulf locales including New Orleans early Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of hurricane Katrina.
38;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Agrium rebuffs calls from fund to split;;Agrium, the Canadian fertiliser group, has rebuffed calls from an activist hedge fund to split itself in two.Responding to pressure from Jana Partners, Agrium on Tuesday said it had considered spinning off its retail business from its more profitable wholesale operations but that it intended to keep the company whole.“Agrium’s board has carefully evaluated the idea of spinning off retail and has unanimously determined that it is contrary to the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” said Michael Wilson, chief executive. “Spinning off retail would expose Agrium shareholders to substantial risk with no sustainable benefit, and we will not be pursuing it.”The defiant tone signals an initial setback for Jana, which owns about 5 per cent of Agrium, valued at about $650m. People familiar with the matter said Jana had been shopping its proposal to split Agrium in two for months but had found a mixed reception among analysts and shareholders.In reply to Agrium, the hedge fund said “companies have said no before, and it’s not always the last word on the subject”. Jana has been involved in spin-offs at other companies, such as Marathon Petroleum and McGraw-Hill where managements had initially rejected the idea of any split.At McGraw-Hill Jana worked with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan to push for a break-up of publishing and financial data businesses. And earlier this year the fund pressured Marathon Petroleum to launch a $2bn share repurchase programme, and explore a sale of its pipeline business.The hedge fund also said that Agrium had focused attention on one of its suggestions, “but said nothing about the operating improvements and cost issues, which even leaving aside a spin-off will generate billions of dollars in value”.Agrium has a market capitalisation of $15.3bn. Its shares were up slightly in early trading, with volume not much higher than usual.In defending itself, Agrium pointed to its stock performance, up 44 per cent this year and nearly double over the past three years. It also noted that it recently began a $900m stock buyback programme.People close to the company also note that unlike McGraw-Hill, Agrium is not a conglomerate of unrelated business but an integrated company with wholesale and retail distribution arms working together.Morgan Stanley is advising Agrium and has told the board that it does not believe separating the retail business would create value for shareholders. As a standalone company, Agrium’s retail operation would have few natural peers and could be an “orphan” stock, uncovered by analysts.

If the company is sold, shareholders who participate in the tender offer may receive an additional $7 a share.Mr Icahn has said strategic buyers could include Valero Energy, Conoco­Phillips, Western Refining, HollyFrontier, Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum, and that he will sell the company for a premium.It is not clear why strategic bidders have not yet emerged, with the company already in play. Mr Icahn also extended his offer for shareholders who have not tendered their shares until midnight on May 18, saying he would offer them $30 a share as well.Last month Mr Icahn said shareholders had tendered 55 per cent of the company’s outstanding shares. At that point CVR waived a poison-pill defence it had put in place after Mr Icahn revealed he had become the company’s largest holder with 14.5 per cent of shares.“We are pleased with the results of our tender offer and are excited to have CVR join the Icahn Enterprises family,” Mr Icahn said. “We look forward to working together with the CVR team.”Mr Icahn’s likely acquisition of CVR comes as a welcome victory after defeats last year. The veteran corporate raider proposed last year to buy bleachmaker Clorox and steelmaker Commercial Metals, but in both cases withdrew after failing to secure shareholder support or find alternative buyers.CVR, based in Sugar Land, Texas, operates oil refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, and holds a majority stake in a fertiliser business. The location of its operations gives it access to lower crude prices than are available on the coasts.Mr Icahn also sold the $250m in debt he holds in LightSquared. The US wireless broadband company backed by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, is talking with creditors to avoid default.Last month, it missed a $29.6m debt payment, and in February the Federal Communications Commission withdrew its conditional approval for a proposed nationwide wireless network, saying it could interfere with navigation systems.That decision, along with financial troubles, led to talk that LightSquared might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, a move that some thought could lead to Mr Icahn seizing control of the company.Additional reporting by Dan McCrum
40;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Icahn says investors support CVR bid;;A battle for control of CVR Energy is looming after Carl Icahn said shareholders had tendered about 55 per cent of the oil refiner’s outstanding shares to him in response to the corporate raider’s hostile bid.Mr Icahn, CVR’s largest shareholder with 14.5 per cent, said he would extend his $30 a share offer to buy it to the end of April.“I stand ready, willing and able to pay $2.26bn to purchase all CVR shares that I don’t currently own as soon as the board permits me to do so,” he said in a letter to CVR.The billionaire launched the bid in February, and has said that if successful, he would seek to sell the company on.But soon after he disclosed his stake and pushed the company to sell itself in January, CVR adopted a poison pill defence.If any investor gains ownership of more than 15 per cent of stock without approval, the board may issue equity to dilute the acquirer’s stake and stop them gaining control.CVR said Mr Icahn could not purchase any shares tendered in his offer and such shares could be withdrawn at any time.“The real choice for stockholders will be at our annual meeting [next month], where they will decide whether to elect Mr Icahn’s handpicked nominees in place of our qualified and experienced board,” it said.Mr Icahn said: “In light of the clear message that shareholders have now sent to the board, it would be a shame if the board took any action to thwart or delay our offer.” He has also threatened a proxy fight for control if CVR continues to rebuff his approach.CVR, based in Sugarland, Texas, owns oil refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as a majority stake in a fertiliser business.The location of the companies operations means that it has benefited from lower prices for crude in the Midwest than on the coast. Its shares closed up 6 per cent at $28.80. The stock is up more than 50 per cent so far this year.The $30 a share bid would value the company at $2.6bn. Mr Icahn has proposed to give shareholders as much as $7 a share on top of the initial offer if the company is sold, with possible trade buyers including Valero Energy, ConocoPhillips or Marathon Petroleum.

We see upside from less exposure to Europe and a potential transaction tax”.Mr Rutschow added that other incumbents could benefit from the collapse of the deal.“If the merger had gone through, there would have been concern that Nasdaq in particular was becoming an also ran in the exchange space globally, but now competitors are under less pressure to do their own deals.”CME Group climbed 2.5 per cent to $245.41, Nasdaq OMX gained a cent to close at $24.77, although shares were hit by fall in fourth quarter net income, and IntercontinentalExchange was up 0.2 per cent to $114.69.Elsewhere, Wall Street was back in tune with global markets, as US stocks climbed higher after a rash of positive global manufacturing survey data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,324.08, back once again into bull market territory, although the index tended to face resistance from sellers taking profit whenever it moved above 1,325 in January.Banks led the rally with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $19.39, as reports gathered momentum that the investment bank has won the race to be the lead underwriter of Facebook’s IPO.Goldman Sachs lagged behind, up just 1.8 per cent to $113.45, on suggestions it may also have been beaten by JPMorgan to the role of second underwriter in the Facebook deal.Large commercial banks also climbed, with Citigroup up 2.9 per cent to $31.60 and Bank of America climbing 3.2 per cent to $7.36 on reports states’ attorneys-general may be looking at a comprehensive deal on mortgage-related litigation that has been hanging over bank stocks since the financial crisis.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 after the company’s fourth-quarter results disappointed on Tuesday evening. Wall Street had been primed for a fall in margins, as the online retailer has pursued growth through heavy spending on its Fire tablet and promotions, but analysts were taken aback by a fall in revenue and sales growth.Brian Nowak at Nomura was equally concerned about the company’s cautious outlook.“This is the seventh straight quarter in which Amazon’s forward . . . guidance has come in below the Street, and the second consecutive quarter where the midpoint of revenue missed guidance. We are lowering our forward estimates,” he told clients.Broadcom climbed 8.1 per cent to $37.13, with management upbeat on the company’s current quarter prospects, without quite calling a bottom to the semiconductor market. That was vindication for analysts who had called for investors to buy the stock in the wake of Apple’s blockbuster results.JPMorgan analysts once again picked out Broadcom’s supplier relationship to Apple smartphones and tablets as they predicted the company will “outgrow the overall semiconductor market [in 2012]”.Whirlpool shares soared 13.5 per cent to $61.64, approaching levels last seen in July, before last summer’s market sell-off. Quarterly profit at the dishwasher manufacturer surged by a fifth on cost savings.Marathon Petroleum shares climbed 9.6 per cent to $41.88, as the company announced a $2bn share buy-back programme. Shares in refiners have slumped in recent weeks after a succession of oil companies announced collapsing margins on refining operations, as the discount of WTI to Brent crude fell in the fourth quarter, increasing input costs for refiners.Shares in hard disc drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.6 per cent to $38.03, as profits at its rival Seagate Technology surged. Seagate shares climbed 20.8 per cent to $25.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,716.46, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,848.27.Gas exploration and production companies sold off again, as natural gas prices reversed their recent rally. Chesapeake Energy fell 0.8 per cent to $20.97, Southwestern Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $30.41 and EQT Corp was off 1.1 per cent to $49.98.Chesapeake, among other companies, has announced cuts in production this year in a bid to put a floor under gas prices.
42;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-01-20T22:03:33Z;S&P 500 on cusp of bull market territory;;A week dominated by fourth-quarter results saw tech companies drive a rally that was belatedly joined by bank stocks and left the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market.Linear Technology sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday as the company said orders for circuit products had picked up in December and January, paving the way for a strong first quarter of 2012.Linear surged 10 per cent to $33.06 over the week while rivals Advanced Micro Devices, up 13.4 per cent to $6.42, and Jabil Circuit, which climbed 9.3 per cent to $23.00, benefited from the improved sentiment.“Historically, [Linear] has generally been right in guiding investors through the cycle bottoming process …usually seeing changes in demand before peers,” John Pitzer at Credit Suisse told clients.Wireless networking companies joined the rally on Wednesday. F5 Networks defied falling revenues from government clients to beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.F5 climbed 12.6 per cent to $120.27, while rival Juniper Networks was up 9.2 per cent to $22.99, though some analysts were cautious about excessive valuations.“At over 24 times our full-year 2012-expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep [F5] moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.The tech rally accelerated at the end of the week as larger companies reported. Old tech appeared to dominate new as IBM, up 5.2 per cent to $188.52, and Microsoft, up 5.2 per cent to $29.71 outperformed Google, which slid 8.4 per cent on Friday alone to $585.99.On closer inspection, the contrasting share price performances were a result of very different factors.Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft’s gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.The tech rally left the Nasdaq Composite index up 2.8 per cent for the week to 2,786.7 while IBM and Microsoft helped the Dow climb 2.4 per cent to 12,720.48.The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent over the week – now up 4.6 per cent for the year – and is on course for its best January in 15 years. The benchmark index has now climbed 19.7 per cent since its close on October 3, just short of the 20 per cent gain that would indicate a bull market.The CBOE Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, closed below 20 for the first time in almost six months on Thursday before falling to 18.4 on Friday, in a further indicator of bullish sentiment.But market participants warned against excessive optimism, noting high inflows into exchange-traded products that profit from a rise in volatility.“Risk assets have had a nice run of late but at least some investors are hedging their bets,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Bank earnings hugged the headlines over the week with investment banks the clear winners as Goldman Sachs climbed 9.9 per cent to $108.74 and Morgan Stanley climbed 10.6 per cent to $18.39 while there was one clear loser – Citigroup slumped 3.6 per cent over the week to $29.27.Investor enthusiasm for investment banking stocks was somewhat surprising, given the abysmal fourth-quarter trading volumes reported by most banks. Morgan Stanley was the one bank to buck the trend, however, while Goldman impressed investors by cutting deeply into costs by reducing staff and pay.“Expectations about pay in the industry have changed but clearly cutting headcount is not something that can be done every quarter,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. “Eventually, US banks need a kinder interest rate environment to generate sustainable earnings growth.”Bank of America climbed 7 per cent to $7.07 over the week, its highest close since October, as it reported a second successive quarter of profit, despite losses at its investment banking business.Credit card companies were the laggards of the financial sector with American Express virtually flat for the week while Capital One fell 5.9 per cent to $46.03 as the company spooked investors with higher than expected costs that pushed profit far below most analyst expectations.Goldman Sachs analysts said “further outperformance” by credit card companies was unlikely, despite several companies reporting an increase in outstanding loans and improving lending margins in the fourth quarter.“Spend volumes decelerated and expenses were elevated,” Goldman told clients.Overall, with 77 companies S&P 500 companies having reported by Friday afternoon, only 55 per cent have beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, one of the lowest rates in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“The market reacts positively to bad news [and] terrible earnings reports are ignored: [these are] signs of a bull market,” worried Mark Ivanhoff at Ivanhoff Capital.The rollercoaster ride continued for investors in Sears Holdings. The department store chain’s market capitalisation halved in the last two months of 2011 after the company announced store closures.But shares rose 46 per cent to $49 this week as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders. Mr Lampert had increased his personal stake in the company last week.Marathon Petroleum climbed 12.5 per cent to $37.17 over the five day period as activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a 5.5 per cent stake in the refiner and promised to push for reforms to increase shareholder value.
43;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2012-01-12T19:42:16Z;Chevron: clear appeal;The bulk of earnings may come from upstream operations;It has been good to be Chevron over the past couple of years – even compared with other integrated oil and gas behemoths – but some reversion to the mean is inevitable. Yesterday’s profit warning, coming two weeks ahead of fourth-quarter results, would have sent the shares down more sharply if refining competitors Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum had not pre-empted it this week.Aside from various non-recurring items, refining was where most of the weakness lay. A benchmark price for gulf coast refining margins, reflecting a standard slate of products for Mexican crude, fell by over half versus the fourth quarter on lower volumes and softer fuel prices. West coast and international refinery volumes also dropped, reflecting facility sales and closures and weak demand. Nearly all of Chevron’s earnings may come from upstream operations in the fourth quarter, and this is where it shines relative to competitors. Chevron was the best-performing large integrated producer globally in 2011. Being more “oily” than “gassy” helps as North American gas prices remain depressed by the shale boom and unusually mild winter.On a calorific basis, WTI crude is near a record 6½ times the price of natural gas. Chevron’s US natural gas production is less than a third of its US hydrocarbon output and less than 11 per cent of Chevron’s total on an oil-equivalent basis. Competitors ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, by contrast, have made mammoth bets on US gas in recent years. Even with declining production through 2013, Chevron’s modest valuation and its leverage to oil prices are attractive. Analysts at Barclays Capital see 57 per cent upside and 18 per cent downside at a long-term Brent price of $120 and $70, respectively (it is now above $113). For those seeking big oil in “Big Oil”, Chevron’s appeal is clear.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices.

SunTrust was up 5.4 per cent to $19.66, and Regions Financial climbed 4.2 per cent to $4.52, while some investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, sat out the rally. Goldman Sachs slipped 0.2 per cent to $94.58.The S&P 500 remained above its 200-day moving average for a third day, a sign of bullish sentiment, while Goldman Sachs reported that one-month realised correlation between the S&P 500 and its sectors, excluding financials, has fallen to its lowest level since August. That is an indication that macro concerns, which tend to shift all stocks in the same direction and increase realised correlation, weighed less on US investors in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off a fraction at 12,415.70.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,669.86, as stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied after Seagate Technology said fourth quarter shipments had been strong, a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected.Seagate climbed 6.4 per cent to $17.90 as it raised guidance, while rival hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $32.76.LSI Corp, which makes semiconductors used in hard drives, rose 7.7 per cent to $6.70 as Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Wedbush securities, recommended clients buy the stock on the Seagate results.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions.

If anything it’s a further catalyst for a positive conclusion to the eurozone summit at the end of the week.”MetroPCS was the standout performer in the S&P 500, gaining 7.8 per cent to $8.87, as Braxton Carter, the mobile phone network’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference that the company was considering bidding for new spectrum to meet the growing demand of a data-hungry customer base.“Store traffic has been very strong for MetroPCS so we expect good gross customer additions for the quarter,” said Kevin Smithen, telecom analyst at Macquarie. “The unknown is what the churn rate is going to be, its impossible to estimate how many customers are leaving.”Rival Sprint Nextel fell 1.5 per cent $2.61, as its wireless network provider Clearwire said it would issue new shares to raise $595m in new capital.Last week Sprint had committed to maintain its 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, meaning it must stump up around $300m of the capital raise.The dilution impact of the new share issuance sent Clearwire shares tumbling to as low as $2.09, but the stock closed up 11.1 per cent to $2.50.“Clearwire shares trade around the probability of bankruptcy, and that has been alleviated incrementally by the funding component,” said David Dixon, telecom analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Fertilisers were among the other big movers, after Norway-based Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertiliser producer, said demand would be strong next year, as high commodity prices provided farmers with an incentive to apply.CF Industries, the second largest nitrogen-based fertiliser company, climbed 4.3 per cent to $146.82. Potash producers Mosaic and PotashCorp were up 3.4 and 3.9 per cent to $53.19 and $43.54 respectively.Yara’s guidance comforted the industry, which has been rocked in recent weeks by fears that the weak rupee would lead Indian farmers to cut back on fertiliser imports or demand price discounts.Petrol refiner Tesoro lost 6.1 per cent to $23.31 after Credit Suisse analysts changed their guidance on the stock to “neutral”.Analyst Edward Westlake remained upbeat on the refining sector, but said other companies such as Marathon Petroleum offered more compelling value.“A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012,” he told clients.Marathon shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.64.Halliburton was rocked by BP’s allegations that the oilfield services company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The stock slipped 3.9 per cent to $35.57.Regional banks took a hit after Deutsche Bank said they may need to cut costs by as much as ten per cent to meet efficiency targets if revenues do not meet targets. SunTrust Banks fell 6.4 per cent to $18.03, Regions Financial declined 3.5 per cent to $4.16 and First Horizon was off 4.4 per cent to $7.43.LinkedIn Corp climbed 4.7 per cent to $73.20 after Morgan Stanley recommended clients buy shares in the professional-networking website, arguing its valuation was compelling, after steep falls in the share price in recent weeks.Eli Lilly climbed 3.9 per cent to $38.86 after Sanford Bernstein analysts said the current valuation assumed “extraordinarily low” expectations for the success of the group’s Alzheimer’s treatments. Tim Anderson, an Sanford Bernstein analyst said Eli’s market capitalisation could double if its latest Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, proved successful.3M climbed 1.5 per cent to $82.13 after the maker of Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes forecast 2012 earnings would be $6.25 to $6.50 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.27.
47;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-11-16T22:03:17Z;Eurozone contagion fears drive US bank sell off;Midwestern refiners hit by narrowing Brent-WTI spread;A warning from Fitch Ratings that US banks are vulnerable to contagion from the eurozone debt crisis trigerred a late sell-off on Wall Street.“Unless the eurozone debt crisis is resolved in a timely and orderly manner, the broad outlook for US banks will darken,” Fitch analyst Joseph Scott wrote.The financial sector of the S&P 500 tumbled 2.5 per cent, led down by Morgan Stanley, which fell 8 per cent to $14.66.Goldman Sachs fell 4.2 per cent to $95.60, Citigroup was off 4.1 per cent to $26.86, Bank of America fell 3.8 per cent to $5.90, and JPMorgan fell 3.8 per cent to $31.47.In another sign of rising financial contagion, the two year interest rate swap spread over Treasuries, which is seen as a proxy for US bank counterparty risk, rose above 50 basis points for the first time since May 2010.Earlier, the S&P 500 had moved slightly positive, as soild industrial production and housing market data added to a sense that US markets were shaking off eurozone shackles. But the benchmark US index eventually closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,236.92.“Its very frustrating. We’re trying to shift back to a US-centric analysis, but this Fitch report has brought the eurozone back into focus,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent to 11,905.97, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.7 per cent to 2,639.61.Elsewhere on Wednesday, companies along the hard drive supply chain were given a boost, after Western Digital Corp, the single largest manufacturer, said it had reached a deal with Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK to buy “heads” – a crucial component in hard drives, which Western Digital has had trouble manufacturing since it closed factories due to flooding in Thailand last month.Western Digital shares closed up 7.1 per cent to $26.82, also boosted by a report that the European Commission will clear the company’s bid to acquire Hitachi’s hard drive unit.“This is a big deal as heads were the biggest challenge to restarting production,” said Jayson Noland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, “but it’s impossible to quantify the impact until we get details on the deal from Western,” he cautioned.Quarterly results from Dell were more sobering for the sector, with revenue from sales of personal computers, still the single largest source of demand for hard drives, falling 4 per cent year-on-year.Dell shares were off 3.2 per cent to $15.13, although some analysts were encouraged by signs of strong growth in storage and enterprise services.“The company seems to be executing its plan to transform into higher value and higher margin areas,” said Jeffrey Fidacaro at Susquehanna.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology surged 23.4 per cent to $6.74, after a jury dismissed claims that the company had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.The case had been brought by Rambus, a tech innovation company, which had been seeking more than $4bn in damages.The market capitalisation of Rambus, which relies on aggressive litigation to protect its patent rights, collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent to $7.11.“Following two key legal losses, which we believed were the cornerstone to our investment thesis in Rambus, we are now recommending investors exit positions,” Jeff Schreiner, an analyst at Capstone investments, told clients as he dropped coverage of Rambus after the decision.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit, as the discount of WTI crude oil to Brent crude shrunk to its lowest in more than six months.Western Refining Inc fell 13.5 per cent to $13.42, and CVR Energy tumbled 16.3 per cent to $18.38. Both companies are almost exclusively dependent on WTI, which has sold at a steep discount to Brent for most of the year, as transport constraints created a supply glut at the WTI terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.News that Canadian firm Enbridge will allow WTI crude to flow to the Gulf Coast from Cushing through a newly acquired pipeline next year erased much of that discount.Even refiners with a small exposure to WTI were significantly affected.Shares in Tesoro fell 6.9 per cent to $25.00. WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s crude, but Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings because of the lower input costs.The share prices of refiners with as little as 15 per cent exposure to WTI crude, such as Valero Energy, have seen strong correlation with the Brent-WTI spread this year, at least until August, when they were caught up in the wider market sell off. Valero fell 9.3 per cent to $22.56 on Wednesday.Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 13.6 per cent to $48.10, after third-quarter results badly disappointed analysts. Earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.Autodesk rose 4.5 per cent to $35.58, after the design software maker reported third-quarter profit of 44 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates, despite worries about that business would cut back on spending given global growth concerns.
48;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-11-09T22:13:59Z;US stocks drop on further eurozone woes;S&P 500 and Nasdaq turn negative for 2011;US stocks closed sharply lower on Wednesday, with financials bearing the brunt of a Europe-inspired sell-off as the S&P and Nasdaq Composite turned negative for 2011.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 5.4 per cent in response to reports that European leaders may allow the eurozone to break up.As analysts put out notes examining individual banks’ exposure to Italy, whose sovereign bonds had hit euro-era highs in the morning session, Jefferies fell 10.1 per cent to close at $11.18. The New York-based investment bank, which is a market-maker in Italian government bonds, spent last week battling to reassure investors about its exposure to eurozone debt.Morgan Stanley fell 9 per cent to $15.76, once again suffering more than other big US banks, as filings showed it had recently carried $1.79bn in net exposure to Italy, after hedges.Goldman Sachs was off 8.2 per cent to $99.67 after the bank said it had $2.3bn of exposure to the Italian government, of which all but $700m is hedged, generally with investment-grade counterparties.Among the commercial banks, Citigroup fell 8.2 per cent to $28.85 and Bank of America was off 5.7 per cent to $6.16.Credit default swaps on US banks also moved upwards on Wednesday. The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose 50 basis points to 445bp, according to data from Markit. That equates to $445,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years, but is still well off the 584bp seen at the start of October.The S&P 500 closed at 1,229.1, down 3.7 per cent for its worst daily performance in three months, and decisively back into negative territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.9 per cent to 2,621.65, in negative territory for the year for the first time in more than a week.General Motors, plunged 10.9 per cent to $22.31 after the Detroit carmaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.7bn, 15 per cent lower than the same period last year, and said it would not break even in Europe this year.Software maker Adobe Systems was down 7.7 per cent to $28.08 after the company cut its 2012 revenue forecast and said it would axe 750 jobs at a cost of up to $78m in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company is to reduce its focus on enterprise software for governments and businesses, and stop adapting its Flash Player software for mobile devices and tablets, calling time on a long battle to persuade the likes of Apple to adopt Flash.“A year ago Adobe would have said Flash was critical to the company’s future,” said Chris Hickey, software analyst at Atlantic Equities, from Adobe’s analyst day in New York. “But Flash-specific products only make up a small percentage of revenues, and I think the sell-off in the stock is overdone.”All 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down – an alarming sign of stocks moving in lockstep in response to macro news from Europe.The blue chip-heavy index fell 3.2 per cent to 11,780.87, with China-exposed stocks among the biggest fallers. Alcoa was down 5.4 per cent to $10.20 and Caterpillar fell 4.4 per cent to $91.64, as fears grew that the eurozone crisis is leading banks to tighten lending in Asia.Hewlett-Packard fell 5.4 per cent to $26.33 after a conference call with Meg Whitman, chief executive, failed to clarify whether the company plans to sell its webOS platform.A sale of the software, which was purchased from Palm for $1.2bn in 2010 to run on HP’s failed tablet offering, would probably mean the company accepting a loss.Computer Sciences Corp plunged 15.4 per cent to $27.90 after slashing its full fiscal year earnings forecast to a range of $4.05 to $4.10 a share. It had predicted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 per share in August.The IT outsourcing company is heavily dependent on US government contracts, and blamed “federal budget uncertainty”, for its lowered guidance.Best Buy was the only stock in the S&P 500 to record gains. It rose 1.4 per cent to $27.22 after Cleveland Research said its survey of individual stores indicated same-store sales growth was positive in October.Groupon executives may be relieved at the timing of last week’s initial public offering, which priced at $20. The stock fell another 3.5 per cent on Wednesday, and is down 7.7 per cent for the week at $24.02, after popping up to $29.52 on its debut last week.
49;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-10-25T20:49:13Z;Netflix plunges 35% as subscribers fade away;Indices open lower but remain up for the month;A sharp narrowing of the spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Brent hit US refiners who have benefited from access to cheap WTI.WTI has been trading around $25 a barrel cheaper than Brent crude since the start of September, but the spread narrowed to just $18 on Tuesday.CVR Energy was down 9.2 per cent to $23.23 and Holly Frontier Corporation fell 12.1 per cent to $28.61.Kansas-based CVR and Holly Frontier, which operates refineries in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Utah, deal almost exclusively in WTI crude, which is stored in Cushing, Oklahoma.Valero Energy fell 6.1 per cent to $21.84 and Marathon Petroleum was off 8 per cent to $32.98. Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
50;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-09-13T21:15:23Z;Return to fundamentals helps S&P 500;;No big news from Europe was good news for Wall Street on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,172.87, its second-best day of September.Although an Italian bond auction attracted record yields, public comments by Angela Merkel confirming Germany’s commitment to help Greece were enough to quash rumours of a Greek default for now.That allowed US investors to focus on fundamentals for a change, and some of the biggest stock price moves were driven by earnings or forecasts.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, missed analyst expectations on second-quarter profit figures and cut its full-year earnings forecast. Falling sales of televisions and mobile phones were to blame. Best Buy shares fell 6.5 per cent to $23.35.Cummins, an engine manufacturer, was up 5.9 per cent at $92.20, after company executives used an analyst meeting to forecast sales growth of 14 per cent to $30bn by 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4 per cent at 11,105.85 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 2,532.15.Although fundamentals played some part in trading, it was yet another day when every sector of the S&P 500 moved in the same direction.S&P 500 sectors are currently 97.2 per cent correlated, according to analysis from ConvergEx Group.This is in addition to correlation among the 250 largest individual stocks in excess of 80 per cent, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash.“The correlations we note among industry sectors are profoundly and dysfunctionally high. They come, in my opinion, from the underlying concern over a second financial crisis,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.Energy stocks were among the laggards of the S&P 500, rising only 0.3 per cent, as oil-linked stocks were hit hard.“In the last few days refiners have seen a substantial narrowing in their product margin, as the spot price of finished petroleum and diesel products has fallen,” said Paul Cheng at Barclays Capital.Mr Cheng also said the narrowing premium in the price of Brent over WTI oil is hurting US refiners. A few Midwestern refiners buy WTI oil, which has been trading at a discount to Brent crude for the past year. As the discount narrows, those refiners face higher input costs.Tesoro Corporation, a big refiner, was down 1.3 per cent at $23.47. Marathon Petroleum was also off 3.6 per cent at $35.34. Other analysts said the sell-off in energy stocks was a reaction to fears about global growth, stemming from Europe. Oil explorers and producers were down too, even though the oil price rose Tuesday, with Denbury Resources falling 1.8 per cent to $13.96.Industrials outperformed on Tuesday, up 1.9 per cent as a sector in the S&P 500.Logistics and distribution groups Fastenal, up 4.7 per cent at $34.35, and WW Grainger, up 3.7 per cent at 157.27, had strong days. WW Grainger had announced 10 per cent rise in quarterly sales on Monday.Southwest Airlines, the budget airline, rose 4.4 per cent to $8.31.That left the S&P 500 higher on two days running for the first time this month. But investors were cautious. “Expect the index to keep trading in bands with 1,250 an absolute maximum, unless the situation in Europe is resolved,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Coca Cola Enterprises, the European arm of the soft drinks giant, was up 3.7 per cent at $26.46, as investors reacted favourably to an analyst day in Paris on Tuesday. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala upgraded the stock to buy, but acknowledged the company faced challenges, in particular from falling demand in Europe and rising input costs due to surging commodity prices.Coke’s “valuation [is] now interesting”, Nomura analyst Ian Shackleton told clients. But he maintained a “hold” rating, telling clients: “We see the stock still being held back by macro issues for now.” Credit Suisse said the company is set to benefit from a “step-change” in UK sales due to advertising for the London Olympics next year.Micron Technology, up 2.6 per cent at $6.86, registered its sixth successive day of gains. Tristan Gerra, semiconductor analyst at RW Baird, said the semiconductor group’s strong performance was due to signs that the spot price for DRam computer memory, Micron’s main product, may have bottomed.
51;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-08-22T21:08:59Z;Wall Street buoyed by QE3 speculation;;US stocks ended the day almost flat after falling bank stocks put paid to an early rally, which had been driven by hopes of a further round of monetary stimulus.Bank of America suffered its fourth largest single-day loss of the year, at one point coming within touching distance of its year low of $6.31, as it struggled to manage bad news.Layla Peruzzi, equity derivatives head at Jefferies, said that “the market is forcing [Bank of America] into a capital raise” and predicted that the Charlotte-based lender would have to raise up to $50 billion through disposals or by issuing new shares.Separately the bank’s card unit agreed to pay $5 million and suspend arbitrations of consumer debt collections in California for two years, to settle a lawsuit brought by the state.The company’s plan to raise capital through disposals took a blow when Zhang Jianguo, president of China Construction Bank, said Bank of America had agreed to retain at least half its 10 per cent holding in CCB.Bank of America was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, its shares closing down 7.9 per cent at $6.42, as financials in the S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, more than any other sector.On Monday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said residential mortgage delinquencies during the second quarter rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 12.9 per cent, after falling at the beginning of the year from last year.The KBW index of bank stocks hit a year low of 35.04 before closing down 1.1 per cent at 35.10.But regional banks rallied slightly. Regions Financial was up 0.5 per cent at $3.88, and bank stocks appeared to be trading on news rather than economics.Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 per cent in late trading to close at $106.51, after Reuters reported chief executive Lloyd Blankfein had hired high profile corporate defence lawyer Reid Weingarten, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank.“Mr Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the [senate permanent subcommittee on investigations] report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs told the Financial Times.The S&P 500 had been up as much as 2 per cent in early trade as investors looked to the Fed to signal another round of quantitative easing after four weeks of sustained losses.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will speak on Friday in Jackson Hole. “The market is expecting another round of asset purchases and it will come,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG.But the S&P 500 again closed near its year low of 1,101.54, up just 0.02 per cent on the day at 1,123.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 1,084.50.Hewlett-Packard gained 3.6 per cent to close at $24.45, reversing some of Friday’s big losses, helping the Nasdaq close up 0.2 per cent at 2,345.38.Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, warned investors against relying on Mr Bernanke to prop up stock prices.“The higher markets rise this week on QE3 anticipation, the more vulnerable they may become should the street not get what it wants,” he said.With Brent crude easing, after rebel forces entered Tripoli, the SIG Oil Exploration and Production index fell 2.4 per cent to 400.79.“A lower oil price pressures the economics of upstream oil development,” said Hsulin Peng, senior analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. But if cheaper oil stimulates the global economy, “increased demand could offset price declines”.While Brent fell, West Texas Intermediate rose. That hurt refiners with strong access to WTI crude on fears that the rising price of inputs, coupled with weak demand for finished oil products, would erode margins.Marathon Petroleum was down 6.9 per cent to $32.58 as the stock’s newness and its dependence on WTI crude weighed on the share price.But Mark Gilman, refineries analyst at Benchmark, said: “The prices of finished oil products are quite properly tracking the price of Brent crude. US investors shouldn’t fixate on the price of WTI.”While investors were trading on sentiment, there was more bad news from the real economy.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July registered -0.06, the fourth successive month that the index has been negative.JPMorgan reduced its target price for FedEx 10 per cent to $105 and cut its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company from $6.60 to $6.Performance at the business mail delivery service is watched as a gauge of overall economic strength. FedEx was down 0.2 per cent at $73.00.
52;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-07-25T21:10:16Z;Debt ceiling impasse pushes US stocks lower;;Wall Street weakened on Monday amid uncertainty over whether an agreement to raise the US federal debt ceiling would be reached, bringing nearer the possibility of a default by the US Treasury.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,337.43, ending a choppy session that hung on the pronouncements of US lawmakers. Nine of the S&P’s 10 major sectors declined, the softest being telecoms services, down 1.4 per cent, and healthcare, down 1.1 per cent. Utilities, a defensive sector, rose 0.3 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,842.80, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,592.80.Investors are waiting to see whether Congress can dissolve partisan deadlock and raise the $14,300bn debt ceiling and avoid potential default before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.Republicans and Democrats announced rival plans to increase the US borrowing cap.John Boehner, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, proposed raising the ceiling in two steps.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, announced a separate measure to raise the debt limit by $2,400bn in a single move.Anthony Conroy, managing director at Convergex, said: “When Congress fails to agree, it’s certainly not viewed as positive. Any uncertainty is creating volatility, and we’re witnessing that volatility today.”The Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, rose 11 per cent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “It still appears very unlikely that the US will actually default, since the political cost of being seen as the group which triggered one could be very high,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.“If there is a deal, even if it limits the growth in Treasury issuance over the next few years, it could remove the roadblock of budget uncertainty from both the economy and markets, an eventuality that should prove stock-positive and bond negative,” he added.The second-quarter earnings season was being overshadowed by the debt ceiling impasse.“We don’t have much in terms of economic news, so the focus is on what is not happening with getting the debt ceiling lifted,” said Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think there’s still juice in this market if they get a deal done.”Lorillard, the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands, fell 4.5 per cent to $107.29 despite reporting quarterly net profit that beat expectations. Analysts speculated that the shares were hit by investors taking profits since the stock had gained 37 per cent this year.Shares in Kimberly-Clarkfell 2.1 per cent to $66.48 after earnings dropped 1.8 per cent as higher costs weighed on the manufacturer of Kleenex tissues. The company also warned that its 2011 earnings could arrive near the lower end of its forecast.Eaton, a US manufacturer, gained 2.8 per cent to $52.59 after beating profit estimates, citing fresh demand for electrical systems and a strengthening truck market.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, reported second-quarter profits that beat forecasts.“The structural improvement in the underlying operations at [Baker Hughes] is no longer a secret to investors, but we expect that [second-quarter] results should help solidify recent improvement in investor sentiment towards the name,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The stock rose 0.1 per cent to $79.94.A handful of downstream oil companies were also strong.

53;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-07-18T18:31:26Z;Integrated oil groups;Separating upstream and downstream operations is the way forward;"Break me up before you go-go. Jim Mulva’s parting shot as chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips was to proclaim the end of the era of the integrated oil company. Conoco is splitting into its downstream and upstream divisions, in the name of creating shareholder value. Investors have not rushed to join any putative trend: the sector share price reaction has been muted. But the pressure to improve lacklustre shareholder returns could yet change that.The integrated model used to have a huge advantage: it guaranteed access to resources. That is no longer the case. It now has a pressing disadvantage: it has conceded integrated companies’ stock market premium to nimbler pure-play upstream operators. Marathon was the first integrated group to address this: its split has replaced one company valued by the market at $23bn with two companies worth a combined $36bn.It is hard to see a ruthlessly streamlined and integrated behemoth such as ExxonMobil imitating this strategy. Other groups, however, should be learning lessons; European integrated oil groups in particular. UBS estimates that they trade at an average 19 per cent discount to net asset value.Some of these companies are accidents of history. Italy’s Eni controls oil services group Saipem as well as gas and power distribution. That model would not be created today. Meanwhile, BP’s effort to close its post-Macondo 30 per cent discount to NAV is not working: its total return this year is a measly 3 per cent.The integrated model has the status of a creation myth for many oil executives. That sells their investors short. Marathon set the ball rolling by completely separating upstream and downstream. Conoco is big enough to make a big difference. A sector long on cash and short on ideas needs to be bold enough to embrace and follow their lead.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
54;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-01-13T21:55:05Z;Jobless claims weigh on US equities;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth- largest US oil and gas company, jumped to two-year highs after announcing a demerger, but this failed to lift the wider markets which fell because of an unexpected rise in new jobless claims.Marathon Oil saw the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 6 per cent
to $42.98 after announcing plans to spin off its refining and sales operations into separate companies.The new company, Marathon Petroleum, will focus on refining, marketing and pipeline transportation while Marathon Oil will focus on exploration and production.Marathon Oil considered a demerger in July 2008, at the peak of the crude oil market, but did not go through with the move following a crash in oil prices during the financial crisis.Crude oil prices have recently rebounded to near $100 a barrel.This move continues the recent trend of demergers on Wall Street.In the previous session, manufacturing company ITT announced it was splitting into three separate groups, sending the shares up 16.5 per cent. ITT was off 3.3 per cent to $59.45.The jump in Marathon’s shares failed to lift the sector, however. The S&P oil and gas index fell 0.3 per cent to 580.65.The wider US markets also lost ground after news that the number of first-time unemployment claims had jumped to their highest levels since October.Figures from the US Department of Labor showed that initial jobless claims had risen by 35,000 to 445,000 in the first week of the new year, above consensus estimates of 410,000.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,283.76, pulling away from the two-and-a-half year high reached in the previous session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 11,731.90, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,735.29.Losses were pared somewhat, however, by news that continuing claims for jobless benefits had fallen by more than had been expected. The number of people receiving long-term unemployment benefits had fallen by 248,000 to 3.88m, its lowest point since 2008.Sentiment was also helped by news of a successful auction of Spanish debt, which helped to calm investors’ fears over eurozone debt.The most significant loser on the S&P was Merck,
the German pharmaceutical group, after it discontinued one of its clinical studies for an anticlotting drug and trimmed another study of about a quarter of the patients. It lost 6.6 per cent to $34.69 on the news.These sharp losses weighed on the S&P healthcare index, which fell
0.5 per cent to 371.88.American Assets Trust, a real-estate investment trust which buys and develops retail and office properties, made strong gains after launching an initial public offering.Shares in the company traded up by 3.7 per cent to $21.25, surpassing estimates of between $19 and $21 per share.The IPO was the first of the year in the US and the biggest for a real-estate investment trust since Starwood Property Trust raised $932m in August 2009.“American Assets Trust’s IPO provides a sound launch for the Reit IPO market,” said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers.AmericanCapital Agency, another real-estate investment trust, fell 1.3 per cent to $28.64 after saying that it planned to sell at least 18m shares in a public stock sale, the second such offering since December.A raft of news emerged in the technology sector,
moving individual stocks.Apple, one of the largest companies in the US, rose to an all-time high after UBS raised its price target on the stock to $415 from $365. The company was up 0.4 per cent to $345.68.TTM Technologies, the printed circuit board maker, rose to a four-and-a-half-year high, increasing
21.3 per cent to $17.74 after raising its fourth-quarter earnings outlook.Technology traders were waiting for fourth-quarter results from Intel, which were due to be released after the markets closed.According to a survey
of analysts by FactSet Research, the company was expected to report earnings of 53 cents a share. Intel lost 0.6 per cent to $21.29 in anticipation of the results.All this left technology stocks slightly up in the session, with the S&P
technology index rising 0.1 per cent to 459.68.Gains on the index were pared, however, by losses for Microsoft, which fell
1.3 per cent to $28.19."
55;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2011-01-13T18:38:59Z;Marathon splits off refineries from exploration;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, is to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business.The move, which sent Marathon’s share price up $3.31, more than 8 per cent, to $43.84, joins a flurry of demergers of US groups including one announced by industrial conglomerate ITT this week. Marathon Petroleum – a newly-created company – will be the fifth-biggest refiner in the US; while Marathon Oil will focus solely on global exploration and production, with growth leveraged to crude oil production.David Pursell, head of Macro Research at Tudor Pickering Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking firm, said that as an integrated group, Marathon has had difficulty standing out.It is too small for investors to consider it a rival to other integrated groups, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The split will allow each company to act in the best interest of its business segment, better attract talent and allow for more specific comparisons against competitors.Marathon’s exploration and production business can now be compared against companies such as EnCana and EOG Resources. Its refining business can be measured against pure refiners, such as Valero.“The market clearly likes the announcement,’’ Mr Pursell said.“This is a vote of confidence for other companies with similar assets to follow.’’Investors have supported other splits, including that by EnCana in 2009 and Questar in 2010. There has been talk of BP and ConocoPhillips demerging but analysts say the effort is more difficult and offers less value for companies of their scale.Marathon’s decision to split follows a long period of consideration that ended two years ago with a decision to remain integrated amid the financial crisis. “The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the past two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,’’ said Clarence Cazalot Jr, Marathon president and chief executive.Marathon’s market value at Wednesday’s closing price was about $28.8bn. The company plans to distribute one share of Marathon Petroleum for every two shares of Marathon Oil. Marathon Oil will pay an initial divided of 15 cents per quarter, based on about 710m shares outstanding, and Marathon Petroleum will pay 20 cents per quarter, based on about 355m shares outstanding.The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and effective from June 30.Moody’s Investors Service placed Marathon’s Baa1 senior unsecured bond rating under review for possible downgrade, noting that the split would reduce scale and eliminate benefits of integration. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial adviser, Baker Botts as legal adviser and Bingham McCutchen as tax adviser."
56;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2007-08-02T00:01:32Z;Marathon settles price manipulation case;;A unit of Marathon Oil on Wednesday settled with federal regulators in a case alleging that the fourth-largest US oil company attempted to manipulate the price of crude oil.The case, brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is the first time the futures regulator has brought an action involving alleged manipulation of crude oil prices since 1979.It is a sign of the CFTC’s concern that oil prices, this week at record highs, may be vulnerable to manipulation by oil companies using their market power to influence the prices set by specialist energy indices that are relied upon by oil shippers and traders as pricing benchmarks.Some lawmakers in the US Congress have also in recent weeks sounded alarm over apparent gaps in the way some energy derivatives are regulated that could make manipulation easier.The Marathon case involves an alleged attempt to take advantage of a 30-minute window of physical crude trading that takes place after the close of futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The window is where deals are done bilaterally between traders in physical crude after the close of trading in Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate crude futures contract.It has become a significant part of the markets because it is used to calculate a pricing index published by Platts, an energy publisher, that is in turn widely relied upon by crude oil shippers and oil companies to set prices.Kathleen Tanzy, a Platts spokeswoman, said: ”Platts has rigorous guidelines for the data accepted for Platts’ price assessments. These guidelines are designed to protect the integrity of our indices.”Indices such as Platts are not subject to any regulation. Their publishers argue that they should not be regulated because they are subject to the same constitutional protections as news media and other information providers.However the CFTC is concerned that trading in the Platts window, particularly in the final minutes before it closes, could be manipulated by large oil companies as a way of affecting the outcome of the price of WTI.Gregory Mocek, the CFTC’s head of enforcement, told the Financial Times: ”Irrespective of the flavour of commodity, all traders who attempt to manipulate indexes should be cautious. Although indexes may be unregulated, we will aggressively use our authority to find illegal conduct.”In an order, the CFTC found that on November 26 2003, a trader at Marathon Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Marathon Oil, “attempted to manipulate a price of WTI by attempting to influence downward the Platts market assessment [index] for spot cash WTI”.Marathon was at the time a net purchaser of crude oil in the market because its own production was not high enough to meet demand from its customers. It was relying on purchases of foreign crude oil shipped into the US, prices for which routinely are priced off the Platts index.Marathon owns about six per cent of the total crude oil refining capacity in the US, according to the CFTC.The CFTC claimed Marathon had “knowingly offered to sell spot cash WTI through the prevailing bid at a price level calculated to influence downward the Platts WTI assessment”. The outcome would have been to lower the price Marathon would pay for incoming shipments of crude.Mr Mocek said: “West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices have an enormous impact on the daily lives of American citizens. As the guardian of the nation’s commodity markets, this case is yet another signal to the markets that we hold all companies accountable for their trading activities.”Marathon agreed to pay a civil penalty to settle the CFTC’s findings. “Without admitting or denying the CFTC’s findings, MPC agreed to pay $1m to settle the matter,” the company said in a statement. “Marathon’s decision to settle was based on a number of factors, including the desire to avoid the expense and distraction of protracted litigation.”The case is the first that the CFTC has pursued in court involving allegations of manipulation in the “Platts window.”Mr Mocek hinted that further action could be possible, saying the CFTC was ”looking at a number of other companies that trade in the Platts window”.The CFTC’s action comes amid a flurry of enforcement cases brought in recent weeks by the regulator at a time of heightened concern in Washington that energy prices are vulnerable to manipulation.Last week, four such cases emerged from the CFTC and the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, which regulates inter-state oil, natural gas and electricity transmission.Both agencies charged hedge fund Amaranth and Energy Transfer Partners, a large Texas-based operator of natural gas pipelines, with attempting to manipulate physical natural gas markets.A congressional report co-authored last month by senators Carl Levin and Norm Coleman claimed that millions of consumers were hit with abnormally high gas prices as a result of “excessive speculation” in natural gas contracts last year by hedge fund Amaranth.A lawyer for Amaranth has said there is no evidence that Amaranth tried to manipulate the markets. ETP’s chief administrative and compliance officer has said he does not believe that his company broke any laws or FERC rules.
57;MPC;Marathon Petroleum Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
