0;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Junk bonds: the rise of ‘fallen angels’;The bond market is being flooded with junk-rated companies and there’s probably more to come;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One thing to start: Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has pledged $1bn of his equity in Square, the payments company he co-founded, to fund global relief for coronavirus. The announcement, made on Twitter, said the contribution amounted to 28 per cent of his wealth.Now on to today’s edition . ..In biblical terms, fallen angels are expelled from heaven. In financial markets, fallen angels are expelled from the coveted investment-grade bond bracket and into junk status. As the name might suggest, it’s not quite hell — but tell that to a corporate treasurer looking for cheap financing.For years traders have talked about the number of companies teetering on the edge of their investment-grade status — in bond market speak that means credit ratings of triple B or above — and how difficult it would be for markets to absorb a huge amount of junk debt if that came to be. Investors who hold corporate bonds have certain risk parameters and many of them are not allowed to hold junk-rated debt. So if a company is downgraded from investment-grade to junk, some are forced to sell that company’s bonds. If this happens in a controlled way, ie a handful of ratings downgrades a year, it’s not such a big deal because there are buyers out there who want to hold riskier bonds. You may have seen them referred to as yield-starved investors.But if there are a large number of downgrades in succession, the junk bond market becomes overloaded with too many sellers and not enough buyers — the investment-grade market is six times the size of the high-yield bond market — which causes a host of issues for businesses in need of financing. Until this year, that didn’t seem like such a problem. The last time we saw companies go from investment grade to junk at breakneck speed was the financial crisis. Then the coronavirus outbreak hit.A record $90bn of debt fell to junk status in March, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. And that’s just the half of it, according to Bank of America, which warns that the total for the year could reach $200bn. Trading figures suggest investors are set for even higher tallies with $360bn of triple B rated bonds, the lowest rung of investment grade, trading with yields comparable to that of double B rated debt as of last week. So who has lost their wings so far? Carmaker Ford is the latest addition to a long list that includes Occidental Petroleum, Macy’s and Kraft Heinz. The biggest risk indicator of a company’s downgradability is debt. Or, as Saint Peter might see it, the second deadly sin: gluttony. This is a must-follow trend for financiers around the world and the FT’s Joe Rennison delivers the full story here.WeWork was once the jewel in SoftBank’s start-up crown. Now it’s merely an opposing party in a Delaware lawsuit. A special committee of board members at the troubled office space start-up sued WeWork’s largest shareholder SoftBank, run by Masayoshi Son, pictured below, and its Vision Fund this week for pulling out of a $3bn tender offer agreed last year. That agreement was part of the Japanese group’s rescue deal.The lawsuit in the Delaware court of chancery centred on two key allegations. First, part of the $3bn share buyout had involved WeWork’s joint venture in China in which the Vision Fund held shares.The buyout could not close until the Vision Fund exchanged those shares for stock directly in WeWork. This required minority investors in the joint venture to waive certain rights of first-refusal.WeWork alleges that Son along with his lieutenants encouraged Trustbridge Partners, one of the minority investors, not to do so — thereby giving him an out on the buyout.Second, WeWork is under investigation by the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and others, which SoftBank has also used to try and back out of the deal.WeWork says in the lawsuit the “investigations were not a surprise, given [Adam] Neumann’s conduct and the company’s loss of billions of value”. It then alleges:“Certain of the investigations concerned statements that SoftBank made regarding its own threats in October 2019 not to fund the warrant when it came due in April 2020.”The “warrant” is the $1.5bn equity investment SoftBank originally agreed to early in 2019.SoftBank will “vigorously” defend itself, a spokesperson said, describing the lawsuit as “a desperate and misguided attempt” to rewrite the tender agreement.“Nothing in the special committee’s filing today credibly refutes SoftBank’s decision to terminate the tender offer,” the Japanese group said, adding that it remained fully committed to WeWork’s success.You can read the lawsuit here. The exhibits, including the communications from SoftBank that sparked the lawsuit, are here. The legal battle comes as the coronavirus pandemic weighs heavily on WeWork’s business. Thousands of its tenants have refused to pay rent or sought to terminate their leases over the past month, including some big businesses such as the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean. It has exacerbated a rise in WeWork’s vacancy rate, which was already climbing as the company opened a spate of new properties. Occupancy at the start of April has fallen to just 64 per cent, down from the 79 per cent level it reported at the end of September. And as one current employee cautioned DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, that drop did not yet account for the full economic fallout of the crisis and the surge of cancellations the company was still girded for.We’re offering a free 30-day trial to Coronavirus Business Update, our level-headed briefing on how the epidemic is affecting the markets, global business, workplaces and daily lives.

The Swedish private equity firm EQT Partners has found a way. It’s in exclusive talks with Air Liquide to buy its Schülke unit, which makes alcohol-based hand rubs and hospital disinfectants, at a valuation of about €900m. Sellers had (of course) wanted buyers to offer a “coronavirus premium” over the €1bn price tag that Air Liquide first hoped to fetch when it put the business up for sale last year — catch up on the FT’s story on that here. But that hope has collided with reality. “Nobody moved” when sellers asked them to raise their bid on the grounds that “there’s been a shift in the way people will use these products going forward”, an adviser to another bidder said.It shows you can still just about do a pre-crisis-era type of deal in the age of coronavirus. The valuation of 12 times adjusted ebitda is punchy, and above last year’s European average of 10.9 times. And even with European public debt markets seized up, EQT was able to bring the auction process to an early end with the help of HPS Investment Partners, the private credit group spun out of JPMorgan Chase, which is providing the debt. Maybe this is the future for private equity. Or maybe it’s the sort of thing you can only do when the deal involves the hottest commodity on the planet. Jason New has joined Onex Corporation as co-chief executive to lead the investment management group with Stuart Kovensky. New was previously at Blackstone, where he held a senior role in its GSO Capital Partners hedge fund. Paula Price is leaving her post as chief financial officer of Macy’s after less than two years on the job.UBS has promoted Barry Donlon to lead debt capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.White & Case has added Dongho Lee as a partner to its global M&A practice in Seoul from rival Herbert Smith Freehills.Boatload of debt $17bn of demand for $4bn in bonds issued by the world’s largest cruise operator, which is leaking monumental amounts of cash monthly and whose ships have been labelled “floating Petri dishes” due to coronavirus outbreaks? Head scratcher. Luckily DD’s Rob Smith goes into the details behind the demand.

(FT)Seeking comfort Over the past decade, the makers of heavily processed food were struggling to keep sales up as changing consumer tastes led them to drop canned beans and frozen pizza in favour of organic kale and quinoa.

1;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Revolvers at dawn: Inside the corporate dash for cash;Companies rush to pull on emergency funding once considered taboo ;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One scoop to start: Masayoshi Son explored an audacious leveraged buyout of SoftBank over the weekend with investors including Elliott Management and Mubadala before opting for asset sales to fund a huge share buyback and debt reduction plan. More here. Now to today’s lead topic . . .Banks offer certain perks to win over big clients. One of those is something called a credit line, which under normal circumstances is a “nice to have”. Few banks anticipate that the clients they serve will need to use the credit lines in full. Up until a few weeks ago, if companies needed more money, they could tap the $10tn US corporate bond market where cash is cheap rather than tug on the safety net of a revolver which tends to be used in emergencies. But over the past three weeks, more than 130 companies in Europe and the Americas have drawn at least $124.1bn from their lenders, according to analysis by FT reporters. The figure is probably even higher because some companies just don’t have to report it.The uncertainty injected into the market by the coronavirus — particularly as to how long a global lockdown will last — has pushed many companies to draw on their credit facilities, some of them in full. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer by volume, is among them. It pulled its entire $9bn loan facility last week to secure some flexibility in the weeks ahead. Kraft Heinz, Hilton Worldwide and Delta Air Lines also secured funding in the same way. The pain is more acute for companies in hospitality and aviation, but almost every industry is feeling it. On the day that the final car facilities across Europe halted, General Motors also drew $16bn from its credit facility, hot on the heels of Ford. Bankers at JPMorgan Chase have been kept busy, providing more dollars in credit line extensions so far this year than any other bank. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to them. JPM went into the year with more than $367bn — about 13 per cent of its $2.7tn balance sheet. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo together provided another $1.2tn of lines, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had a combined $260bn, regulatory filings show. For many people in the banking industry, this is all relatively new. But for those that have lived through other events — like the 2008 financial crisis and 9/11 — they think the worst is yet to come. Even in the aftermath of the last crisis, tapping a credit line remained taboo.On Tuesday DD told you about “Arbageddon”, today we bring you “Quant Quake”. We’re not panicking, honestly. For anyone out there that feels like they’re having a hard time adjusting to the brave new coronavirus world, perhaps you can take some comfort in the fact that even computers are malfunctioning. Quantitative hedge funds, which rely on high-powered computers, vast data sets and algorithms to turn a profit, have over the past decade been a rare bright spot in the hedge fund industry. But the turmoil inflicted by Covid-19 has unsettled even the gold standard of quant funds. DE Shaw, Two Sigma, and Renaissance — the holy trinity of quantitative investing — have all seen some of their biggest funds hurt this month, DD’s Ortenca Aliaj and our colleague Robin Wigglesworth report. One large hedge fund investor called his book of quants a “disaster”. The pain is more profound because everyone seems to have expected the strategy to perform well, as was the case in 2018 when two volatility leaps inflicted huge losses on the hedge fund industry but quants stood tall. It’s almost unheard of to see Renaissance’s flagship Institutional Equities Fund take losses even in the single digits, let alone the 18 per cent drop it suffered in the first three weeks of March. Similarly, DE Shaw’s pricey “statistical arbitrage” hedge fund Valence, which at 3-and-30 charges almost treble the industry average, lost more than 9 per cent this month. Steve Cohen’s quant unit at Point72 Asset Management has also been hit, Bloomberg reported, and is down more than 20 per cent. The glitch in the quant system is perhaps another reminder that markets aren’t functioning as expected. Investors will have to see how the “Quant Quake” shakes out.India, the world’s second most populous country, is headed into lockdown as it tries to stop the spread of the coronavirus. So depending on how you see things, Facebook’s plan to buy a multibillion-dollar stake in Reliance Jio, the mobile internet service company, has come at an opportune time.As 1.3bn Indians are locked inside their homes in the coming three weeks, internet and mobile services will be of vital importance to receive information, work from home and stay in touch with friends and family. If they can get the deal through the door, that is. The investment has been stalled by the coronavirus travel ban.The deal, first reported by the FT’s Anjli Raval, Tim Bradshaw and Benjamin Parkin, will give Facebook a 10 per cent share in Jio, whose cut-price service has attracted 370m Indians in just three years. The social media network stands to get a key foothold in the Indian market where its WhatsApp chat service already has 400m users and is about to launch a payments service. Launched four years ago by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, below, Jio is valued at more than $60bn, but its rapid expansion has lumbered Reliance with a heavy debt load.A deal with Mark Zuckerberg would help the company meet its target to cut net debt to zero in a year. And it’s not a bad time for a heavily capitalised company like Facebook to expand, says the FT’s Lex.

2;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-02-18T16:08:39Z;Corporate bonds: schlock full;Investors seem unfazed that more debt could fall off investment grade ladder;Cheap debt is a narcotic. Back in 2018, many corporates tried to quit. But as central banks turned on the taps again in 2019, businesses once again succumbed. Last year, they borrowed an additional $2.1tn in the form of corporate bonds, says the Paris-based OECD.The scale of the decade-long bond binge is unprecedented. So too is the poor quality of much of the debt. Over half of investment grade bonds — 51 per cent — was rated triple B, the lowest tier, last year. During 2000-2007, the portion was 39 per cent. Triple B is just one notch above junk status. The danger is that a recession causes downgrades. Many holders would then have to sell the bonds of such “fallen angels” as their mandates stop them owning non-investment grade paper.Take US food company Kraft Heinz, for example. Last week, rating agencies cut its rating below the investment grade threshold, making it the largest “fallen angel” in almost 15 years, according to data from Ice Data Services. Kraft’s bond due in 2046, formerly trading above 102 cents on the dollar, has slumped to 93 cents.Expect more dropouts from the heavenly host. The OECD reckons $261bn of triple B rated bonds would fall off the lowest rungs of the investment grade ladder in a serious economic downturn.Higher borrowing costs are not the only threat to companies. Investors are also taking bigger risks. They may be over optimistic that they can easily sell their holdings in a relatively illiquid market. That fear has increased with the growing portion of triple B bonds in the portfolios of US investment-grade corporate bond mutual funds — up sharply from 20 per cent to 45 per cent in the eight years to 2018.For now, bondholders seem unfazed. Central banks are supportive on liquidity. Interest cover, operating profit as a multiple of interest payments, is relatively high historically, says UBS. Many companies may aim to reduce their debt levels. But policy wonks are right to worry. The longer the debt binge continues unchecked, the harder it will be to kick the habit later.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly. Please sign up here.
3;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-02-18T04:00:28Z;Kraft downgrade could leave other issuers playing ketchup;Foodmaker is biggest borrower to fall from investment-grade status in almost 15 years;The $1.2tn junk bond market just got about $23bn bigger. Kraft Heinz became the largest high-yield bond issuer last week, after it was downgraded by two of the big three rating agencies.The company’s relaxed approach to its sizeable debts met with the agencies’ ire after it reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Both Fitch and S&P Global cut it from triple B minus to double B plus, pushing it below the threshold that separates investment-grade from high-yield. That makes Kraft Heinz the largest “fallen angel” in almost 15 years, according to index data from Ice Data Services.Bond investors had been waiting for such a scenario: where big companies that rushed to borrow cheap money after the 2008 financial crisis fail to reduce their debt burdens, and are punished by the rating agencies. That fall into junk territory then forces some investors — bound by strict requirements to hold only top-quality bonds — to sell out of the company, sending prices tumbling further.Kraft’s bond due in 2046 had been trading above par before results day but fell sharply by the end of the week, dropping from above 102 cents on the dollar to 91.5 cents.By itself, the downgrade should not disturb the broader market. Demand for high-yield bonds remains high. Kraft’s bonds may have been hard hit because much of its debt has a maturity longer than 10 years, which is uncomfortably long for many high-yield investors. After the big fall in price, the company’s debt will probably find a home among a new group of investors more tolerant of risk.But is the downgrade a sign of more to come? Bonds on the lowest rung of the investment-grade ladder have more than doubled over the past decade, to almost $3.4tn, and now account for around half of the market, according to an index run by Ice Data Services. Last month the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reiterated its concerns over the amount of triple B rated debt outstanding.There are reasons to remain sanguine. Strong support from central banks has pushed out expectations of a recession in the US. And despite corporate debt levels rising to a record 47 per cent of gross domestic product, UBS analysts note that interest coverage ratios, a measure of interest bills as a percentage of operating profit, are above historical averages. Furthermore, many companies have embarked on stringent debt reduction plans, in contrast to Kraft Heinz, which still carries much of the debt taken on to finance the 2015 mega-deal that created it.Even so, UBS expects around $80bn of debt will topple from investment grade into high yield this year, a number that could rise rapidly, if the next recession arrives sooner than expected. The bank’s analysts forecast $215bn to $235bn of fallen angel debt in the next downturn but warn that if things get really bad, that range could “almost double.”joe.rennison@ft.com
4;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-02-15T00:03:40Z;US judge slams CFTC over market manipulation settlement;Mondelez and Kraft Heinz sought to hold US regulator in contempt of court after public statements;A US judge lambasted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for “egregious misconduct” as he handed a partial victory to Kraft Heinz and Mondelez, the food companies who have been battling the US regulator over alleged manipulation of wheat markets.The decision on Friday came after the companies asked the judge to hold the CFTC and two of its commissioners in contempt of court and impose sanctions for breaking a gag order in a $16m settlement announced in August. The scope and details of the judge’s order were not immediately available.The CFTC charged Kraft Heinz and Mondelez in 2015 with rigging US grain prices by purchasing massive quantities of Chicago-listed wheat futures. The conduct was alleged to have taken place when they were a single company, before their demerger in 2012. Both Kraft Heinz and Mondelez have denied the allegations in the case.The August settlement agreement resolved the CFTC’s litigation with a monetary penalty and included an unusual clause preventing the parties making public statements on the case beyond referring to the court record.But the agreement quickly collapsed in acrimony. When the CFTC and two commissioners, Dan Berkovitz and Rostin Behnam, issued statements on the settlement, the companies claimed they had violated the deal.The companies asked the federal judge overseeing the settlement, John Robert Blakey in Chicago, to hold the CFTC and the commissioners in contempt of court and to make 11 other orders and findings, which were redacted in court filings.On Friday Mr Blakey said that “given the egregious misconduct” by the CFTC he would grant the companies’ request “in part”.It was not immediately clear which parts he had granted or denied. The notice on the court’s docket said a written order would be issued later.Mondelez declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A CFTC spokesman had no immediate comment. Representatives for the two commissioners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr Blakey had ordered Mr Berkovitz and Mr Behnam, as well as the chairman of the CFTC, Heath Tarbert, to appear in his courtroom to explain themselves after the companies cried foul. An appeals court blocked the move, however.The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that the commissioners could not be held in contempt as they had “a right to publish an explanation” of their votes on the settlement.The CFTC had argued that the gag clause bound only the agency, not its commissioners, and that its own statements had not violated the agreement.At a court hearing on Thursday, the parties said they had agreed to a new settlement that would include dropping the contempt claims, according to a report by Wolters Kluwer, the information services company, and a person familiar with the matter.The commission had charged that Kraft Foods, which later became Mondelez and Kraft Heinz, bought “huge” amounts of Chicago-listed wheat futures, pushing down the relative price of physical wheat that supplied a company flour mill in Toledo, Ohio.The purchases also violated limits on the size of futures positions, exceeding the 600-contract limit by as much as 2,110 contracts although the company had no bona fide need for such a large position, the CFTC alleged.The commission’s leadership has changed since the agency first brought the case. Last month, under Mr Tarbert, the agency proposed a new position limit regime that would lift the maximum number of contracts that could be held by any single trader. In the case of wheat futures, the cap would rise to 1,200 from 600.
5;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-02-14T22:48:43Z;Rating agencies cut Kraft Heinz bonds to junk status;S&P cites ‘significant mismanagement’ at food giant backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital;Kraft Heinz faced the consequences on Friday of its decision to maintain dividend payouts to Warren Buffett and other shareholders despite its $28bn debt burden, as two credit rating agencies cut their rating on the food company to junk status.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch revoked their investment grade rating a day after results showed the maker of Heinz ketchup, HP Sauce and Kraft macaroni and cheese was still losing customers.The downgrades extended a sharp sell-off in Kraft Heinz bonds, threatening to elevate the company’s borrowing costs by removing the securities from investment-grade indices.The junk ratings underline the group’s fall from grace since the combination of Kraft and Heinz, a deal engineered by Mr Buffett and Brazilian-US investment group 3G Capital that promised to transform the global food industry.Shoppers have been shunning packaged foods in favour of fresher and trendier alternatives, leaving Kraft Heinz to grapple with falling sales and a $28bn debt burden, a legacy of the 2015 mega-deal that created it.Directors this week kept the company’s quarterly dividend on hold despite another batch of weak results, surprising some investors who had expected more urgent action to reduce its financial leverage.We believe it’s important to shareholders to maintain our dividend during this time of transformationExplaining the decision to cut the company’s credit rating one notch from triple B minus to double B plus, S&P cited the company’s “unwillingness” to cut its dividend. It also said there had been “significant mismanagement” at the company in recent years.Fitch, which reduced its rating to the same level, warned that Kraft Heinz may need to raise $9bn from disposals to reduce leverage to the levels that executives have said they are targeting.If maintained throughout the year, the 40 cents quarterly dividend would cost the company an estimated $2bn and be worth about $500m to Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which holds a near-27 per cent stake. 3G owns 20 per cent.Kraft Heinz said in a statement on Friday: “We believe it’s important to shareholders to maintain our dividend during this time of transformation. We also remain committed to reducing leverage over time as we reposition the company for sustainable growth and returns.”The food group’s problems have brought scrutiny to 3G’s management techniques and critics on Wall Street have complained it became too reliant on cost cuts to drive returns. Kraft Heinz is wrestling with demands from shareholders and credit rating agencies at the same time as it tries to invest in marketing and product improvements.Moody’s, a third agency, on Friday kept its investment grade rating intact but put Kraft Heinz on notice for a possible future downgrade as it reduced its outlook on the debt to “negative”. It said the company had underinvested in key brands and now had to plough funds into the business to improve revenues.The rating agency said the steps that were required to do so would “reduce operating profit margin and sustain upward pressure on financial leverage” for at least the next year.S&P said the company had demonstrated a “lack of commitment to meaningfully deleverage” over the next year. It also cautioned that asset sales may be no panacea, depending on the prices fetched and profits foregone.A Kraft Heinz corporate bond maturing in 2046 fell again on Friday after a decline on Thursday, to leave it changing hands at about 92 cents. It had been trading above 102 cents on the dollar earlier in the week.The company’s shares, meanwhile, closed down 3 per cent, bringing the fall in market value to about 38 per cent since the start of 2019.Paulo Basilio, Kraft Heinz chief financial officer, said this week that the company was not prepared to “sacrifice necessary investments in the business”. He said: “We are even more confident in our long-term prospects behind the new strategy, portfolio prioritisation, and growth initiatives.” Further details would be unveiled in May, he said.
6;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-02-13T17:56:14Z;Kraft Heinz set for showdown with rating agencies;Food group avoids dividend cut despite $28bn debt burden;Kraft Heinz has resisted a further cut to its dividend even as the food company grapples with a $28bn debt burden and falling sales, raising the prospect of further asset sales to avoid a junk credit rating.Results on Thursday showed the company, whose products include Heinz ketchup, HP Sauce and Kraft macaroni and cheese, is still battling to stop consumers defecting to healthier and trendier products.A new round of writedowns helped push shares in Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian-US investment group 3G Capital, down 8 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York.The latest non-cash charges comprised a $213m goodwill impairment on Maxwell House coffee and a $453m hit on assets in Australia, New Zealand and a Latin America exports business.But directors at the company, whose weak performance has epitomised the challenges facing legacy consumer brands, kept the payout to shareholders steady at 40 cents a share.The decision “seems to set up a showdown” with credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s, said Chris Growe, analyst at Stifel.S&P had said ahead of the results that Kraft Heinz may need to cut the dividend again to preserve an investment-grade rating. Shares in Kraft Heinz had already fallen 31 per cent since the start of 2019, when the company cut its dividend by more than one-third.Miguel Patricio, who became chief executive a year ago, said the latest dividend decision was a sign of “confidence in our turnaround plan and our ability to reposition Kraft Heinz for sustainable long-term growth and returns”.Yet Paulo Basilio, chief financial officer, acknowledged Kraft Heinz’s leverage may not have fallen “as rapidly as desired”.The company, created in 2015 by the combination of Kraft and Heinz in a deal engineered by 3G and Mr Buffett, ended 2019 with $28.2bn in long-term debt compared with $30.8bn a year ago.Mr Basilio said the company would “continue to evaluate opportunities” to make divestitures but was “in no rush” to do so.The results for 2019 were “disappointing” and the company’s turnround “will take time”, but the company would this year lay “a strong foundation for future growth”, Mr Patricio said.Kraft Heinz was able to increase average prices 2 percentage points in the final three months of 2019, but revenues were hit because volumes slid 4.3 points, with particular weakness in the US.Sales fell 5.1 per cent from a year ago to $6.53bn. Excluding effects of currency fluctuations and asset disposals, they were down 2.2 per cent.5.7%Net revenue growth in Q4 2019 at Kraft Heinz’s rival PepsiCoThe latest charges follow a $15bn writedown the group took a year ago to reflect gloomier prospects for some of its best-known brands, including Oscar Mayer meats. That had pushed the company to a net loss of $12.6bn for the fourth quarter of 2018.Net income was $182m in the fourth quarter of 2019.Kraft Heinz is wrestling with demands from shareholders and credit rating agencies at the same time as it tries to target investments in marketing and product improvements. The Chicago-based company’s problems have brought scrutiny to 3G’s approach to expenses, with critics on Wall Street complaining it had become too reliant on cost cuts to drive returns.Rivals have said they are bearing fruit from investments they are making, particularly in new, healthier products.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer of PepsiCo, said on Thursday that the food and drinks company was showing the results of a “pivot to growth” after net revenues rose 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter to $20.6bn.Products being pushed by PepsiCo include sugar-free adaptations of its Gatorade and Mountain Dew drinks.

Disposals and the strong dollar caused much of that decline, yet there was also a 1.1 per cent fall on an organic basis.Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett and the Brazilian-US investment group 3G Capital, has become emblematic of struggling companies in the consumer goods sector. Products that had been household staples for generations have gone out of fashion.Miguel Patricio, who became chief executive this year, said the latest results “remain below our potential” but added the company was “making good progress in identifying and addressing the root causes of past performance, as well as setting our strategic direction”.“Although there is still much work ahead, we’re encouraged by our improving performance.”Wall Street analysts had expected the declines and shares in Kraft Heinz, which have sold off heavily this year, rose 4.7 per cent in pre-market trade. The latest results from the Chicago-based company follow a $1.2bn accounting charge in August and a $15bn writedown earlier in the year.In the third quarter a one-time gain on the sale of the Company’s Canadian natural cheese business helped net income rise from $619m to $899m. Stripping out exceptional items, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell 7.8 per cent to $1.5bn as higher input costs also hurt the bottom line.The earnings come after it emerged last month that 3G, which created the food business in a 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz, reduced its stake. 3G sold $713m worth of stock, cutting its stake from about 22 per cent to 20 per cent. At the same time, individual 3G partners including Jorge Paulo Lemann bought about $200m of stock.

The CFTC and two of its commissioners then announced the settlement with unflattering statements that the companies said went well beyond the terms of the order.The companies sought a ruling of civil contempt against the agency. US district judge John Robert Blakey wrote in a legal filing that the regulators were also exposed to potential charges of ethical violations or a referral for an investigation into criminal contempt.Judge Blakey had ordered CFTC chairman Heath Tarbert and the two commissioners, Dan Berkovitz and Rostin Behnam, to testify in his Chicago courtroom at a hearing scheduled October 2.But on Thursday, a three-judge panel from the Seventh Circuit US Court of Appeals stayed the proceedings. The suspension will continue until the panel decides whether to take over aspects of the case from the lower court, as requested by lawyers for the CFTC. Such an emergency action, known as a “writ of mandamus,” is very rarely granted, said a derivatives lawyer who has been following the case.The appellate judges — Frank Easterbrook, Ilana Diamond Rovner and Diane Sykes — also ordered documents filed in their court to be made public. Most documents pertaining to Kraft and Mondelez’s contempt charges have been sealed in the court of Judge Blakey.“As a procedural matter, this is truly a very extraordinary event,” said Gary DeWaal, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman in New York.The CFTC officials are being represented by Zachary Fardon, a lawyer at the King & Spalding firm in Chicago. Mr Fardon was once US attorney in Chicago. The former prosecutor was the first to obtain a guilty verdict for “spoofing” US futures markets, a form of deceptive trading.CFTC and Kraft Heinz declined to comment, while Mondelez International did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the same time, individual 3G partners bought about $200m of stock. They were led by 3G Capital founding partner Jorge Paulo Lemann, who purchased about $100m of shares at $28.60.Mr Lemann said in a statement: “I am increasing my investment in Kraft Heinz because I believe in its potential for a turnaround, and plan to hold this investment for the long run.”The transactions pushed shares in Kraft Heinz down nearly 4 per cent to $28.50 in early trading on Tuesday. The stock has lost more than a third of its value this year, one of the hardest hit in the consumer staples sector as a result of changing shopper tastes.3G Capital declined to comment. The shares were being sold by investors in a 3G investment fund in an “annual liquidity window”, which means they are permitted to sell down their stakes only at particular times, said Bryan Spillane, analyst at Bank of America. The investors had been invested for about seven years, he added.The identity of the selling investors was not disclosed. A host of wealthy luminaries, including tennis champion Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, is known to have invested in 3G.The share dealings come at a time of concern on Wall Street about the prospects for Kraft Heinz as consumers shun its brands. The Chicago-based company, whose products include Heinz Ketchup, HP Sauce and Kraft Macaroni and cheese, took another $1.2bn accounting charge in August after a $15bn writedown earlier in the year.Kraft Heinz has been forced to slash its dividend and also restate several quarters of earnings after an internal investigation uncovered errors in the way it had accounted for supplier contracts. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.Bernardo Hees stood aside as chief executive this year and was replaced by Miguel Patricio.
10;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-08-20T00:09:44Z;US regulator pulls disputed public statements from its website;CFTC takes ‘remarkable’ step after reaching legal settlement with Kraft Heinz and Mondelez;A US financial regulator has removed sensitive public announcements from its website and been ordered to send top officials to testify in court as it faces blowback from an extraordinary legal settlement with two giant food companies.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s $16m fine and court-approved consent order against Kraft Heinz and Mondelez International last week resolved civil charges alleging the companies had rigged wheat prices.Less than a day later, the companies accused the agency of violating the order — specifically, an unusual provision censoring what the CFTC could say in public about the case — when it released three statements trumpeting the outcome.On Monday, John Robert Blakey, a federal judge, ordered Heath Tarbert, the recently sworn-in CFTC chairman, two commissioners and the agency’s enforcement director to testify at a hearing on the companies’ claims. The agency also voluntarily scrubbed the disputed statements from its website.I can’t imagine this has ever occurred before with respect to a government agency“It was an extraordinary consent order, and the fallout now from that consent order and the subsequent releases is even more remarkable,” said Gary DeWaal, special counsel at Katten Muchin Rosenman, a law firm.The CFTC polices futures and swaps markets worth trillions of dollars. In 2015 it charged Mondelez and Kraft with manipulating wheat prices by buying up large amounts of wheat futures to influence the prices it paid for crops near an Ohio flour mill.The two US companies were a single company named Kraft Foods at the time of the trading in 2011. They now have combined annual revenues of more than $50bn, selling widely known brands such as Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard.Last week, the CFTC said its penalty against the companies was three times their alleged gain, while Mr Tarbert said that market manipulation “inflicts real pain on farmers” and “hurts American families by raising the costs of putting food on the table”.The companies said these statements were false and asked the judge to hold the agency in contempt of the court order. “The CFTC never alleged that Kraft deprived farmers of the fair value of their hard work and crops, nor that Kraft raised the cost of putting food on the table,” their lawyers said in a legal motion.The CFTC and the companies reached a binding agreement to settle the case in March, but took months to negotiate the final settlement. The deal came soon after the agency lost a major manipulation case at trial against DRW, a high-volume derivatives trading firm.The commission last week said the gag order to which it agreed did not prevent individual commissioners from commenting. Commissioners Dan Berkovitz — a former CFTC general counsel — and Rostin Behnam did so, both saying they believed Kraft Foods manipulated the wheat market.“Defendants were represented by able counsel throughout these proceedings, and the terms of the order were fairly negotiated,” the CFTC’s lawyers wrote in a response. “Defendants might have pushed for more concessions, but having failed to do so, they may not return to court to cry foul.”The companies sought a ruling of civil contempt, not criminal contempt. However, the CFTC asserted the fifth amendment, the constitutional provision against self-incrimination, at a hearing on Monday, according to a docket entry. The move preserved CFTC courtroom lawyers’ ability to confer with commissioners and the agency’s general counsel before taking further action under pressure from the judge, according to someone with knowledge of the court proceedings.Judge Blakey ordered Mr Tarbert and the other CFTC officials to “appear in person” in his Chicago courtroom at an evidentiary hearing on September 12, and “provide live testimony as needed”. A CFTC spokesman declined to comment.“I think this must be unique,” said Jerry Markham, a law professor at the Florida International University and former CFTC attorney. “I can’t imagine this has ever occurred before with respect to a government agency. They’ve got commissioners of the agency who are in the dock, so to speak. It’s astonishing.”
11;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-08-15T22:58:06Z;Food groups’ fight over wheat manipulation re-erupts;CFTC in legal tussle with Mondelez and Kraft Heinz over gag order on $16m settlement;"A long-running legal tussle between the food companies Mondelez International and Kraft Heinz and a US market regulator reignited in fury, just hours after it had been formally concluded by a federal judge.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission extracted a $16m penalty from Mondelez over allegations it and Kraft manipulated the US wheat futures market when they were a single company in 2011. But the commission agreed to an unusual condition not to publicly comment about the case — a pact the companies said on Thursday that it had violated.Mondelez and Kraft, makers of supermarket brands such as Oreo cookies and Philadelphia cream cheese, said they would immediately return to court to contest the way the regulator announced the deal.“We strongly disagree with the CFTC’s statements, which blatantly violate and misrepresent the terms and spirit of the consent order, and will be seeking immediate relief from the court,” each company said in separate statements.The blow-up marks a surprising denouement to four years of litigation that tested new enforcement powers conferred on the derivatives markets regulator by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.The CFTC in 2015 accused Mondelez and Kraft of distorting the price of wheat futures, among the world’s most heavily traded agricultural contracts. The two companies were one at the time of the alleged market manipulation in 2011, before being separated through a corporate spin-off.The case involved an obscure relationship between the price of Chicago’s soft red winter wheat futures markets and the prices for physical wheat that the companies — then known as Kraft Foods — purchased to supply a company flour mill in Ohio. The CFTC alleged Kraft captured $5.4m in ill-gotten gains.“America is the breadbasket of the world; wheat markets are its heart. Market manipulation inflicts real pain on farmers by denying them the fair value of their hard work and crops,” Heath Tarbert, CFTC chairman, said in a statement announcing the $16m penalty on Thursday.All three parties agreed to settle the case in March, according to court records, but status hearings continued for months before Judge Robert Blakey of the US District Court in Chicago.The commission said its five members unanimously agreed the settlement, including the clause that bars it from making any public comments about the case other than those based on public documents.“We do not expect the commission to agree to similar language in the future,” it added, except in limited situations.The settlement finalised on Wednesday comes several months after the CFTC suffered a bruising trial defeat in a case that accused Chicago-based proprietary trading firm DRW of rigging an interest-rate futures market.The consent order in the Mondelez-Kraft case also lacked so-called findings of fact and of law, which would detail the facts of the case as agreed by the judge. The omission was “uncommon”, said Benjamin Sauter, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim, a law firm that represented DRW in its defence against the CFTC.“To some extent it defeats the purpose of an enforcement action, which is to provide guidance to the industry, one thing the settlement utterly fails to do. The omission is particularly glaring here because the industry has been looking for guidance on the standard for manipulation following the CFTC’s loss in DRW,” Mr Sauter said.Individual commissioners were not muzzled by the agreement agreed by the CFTC in the Mondelez-Kraft case. Two of them, both Democrats, issued a separate statement expressing misgivings about the gag clause and the absence of factual findings in the consent order.Commissioners Dan Berkovitz and Rostin Behnam said that in future, the commission should avoid confidentiality provisions in its settlements.“We are voting for this settlement because we believe that [Kraft Foods] manipulated the wheat market. The $16m penalty and injunctive relief that the commission has obtained in this consent order is as much as the commission could reasonably expect to obtain if it were to prevail at trial,” they said."
12;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-08-08T21:24:59Z;Kraft Heinz shares slump on new writedowns and falling sales;Profits halve as Buffett-backed foodmaker continues to struggle with changing tastes;"Kraft Heinz has taken another $1.2bn worth of writedowns and said there was a risk of more to come, intensifying concerns on Wall Street about the prospects for the Warren Buffett-backed food company as more shoppers shun its brands.Shares in Kraft Heinz closed down 8.6 per cent on Thursday, bringing the sell-off this year to 34 per cent, after it disclosed the latest hit to its balance sheet alongside a near 5 per cent decline in first-half sales. The Chicago-based company, whose products include Heinz ketchup, HP Sauce and Kraft macaroni and cheese, scrapped previously issued annual earnings guidance after its first-half profits halved from a year ago.Miguel Patricio, its new chief executive, said he was planning a “comprehensive review” of Kraft Heinz that could include selling some brands. “The level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of,” he said. The group had promised to transform the food industry when it was created in 2015 by the combination of Kraft and Heinz in a deal engineered by the investment firm 3G Capital and Mr Buffett. But it has since become the poster child for struggling consumer goods companies. Products that had been household staples for generations have gone out of fashion.We need a strategy, first of all, for growthThe latest accounting charges disclosed on Thursday add to a $15bn writedown Kraft Heinz took earlier this year due to gloomier prospects for some of its best-known brands, including Oscar Mayer meats.Difficulties continued in the first half. Price cuts in North America helped push net sales down 4.8 per cent from the same period a year ago to $12.4bn. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, they fell 1.5 per cent.“There’s going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modelling assumption,” said David Knopf, chief financial officer.The problems at Kraft Heinz have brought scrutiny to 3G’s once-lauded approach to expenses, with critics on Wall Street complaining it became too reliant on cost cuts to drive returns.“Without this discipline we would be in a worse place today,” said Mr Patricio. “But we have to do more than that . . . Maybe in the past, we were too focused on the bottom line.”Setting out his commitment to making “consistent investments” in its brands, Mr
Patricio said: “We need a strategy, first of all, for growth.”The latest non-cash charges comprised a $744m goodwill writedown to reflect reduced forecasts for several of its international businesses and a $474m hit to intangible assets caused by the drop in its share price. They pushed net income in the six months to the end of June down from $1.76bn a year ago to $852m. Mr Patricio said it was a priority to reduce the company’s debt burden, which stood at $29.8bn at the end of June compared with a market capitalisation of $33.6bn on Thursday. “We need to strengthen the balance sheet,” he said.However, the chief executive, who is 40 days into the job, said it was too early to say what disposals were being planned.“All we know is that the first half was not great,” said James Targett, analyst at Berenberg. “The uncertainty is ongoing.” Kraft Heinz restated almost three years of earnings earlier this year after an internal investigation uncovered errors in the way it had accounted for supplier contracts. The internal probe pointed the finger at misconduct by employees in procurement. The company’s accounting is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr Patricio, who was brought in from brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to replace Bernardo Hees, said the company still had a bright long-term future. “Our brands are icons,” he said, noting many of them had been around for over a century.He said he was scrapping the annual financial guidance as “setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive”. In the latest delay to its financial statements, the company also said it was unable to file its full quarterly report with the SEC by the prescribed due date.Kraft Heinz’s earlier writedowns had dragged Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, a major shareholder, to one of the largest quarterly losses in its history. Mr Buffett has since said Berkshire “overpaid” for its interest in Kraft. "
13;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-06-20T20:19:29Z;S&P latest to downgrade Kraft Heinz to lowest investment grade;;S&P Global became the latest to cut Kraft Heinz’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade on Thursday, potentially further complicating the packaged food conglomerate’s efforts to reverse flagging sales growth and draw a line under problems with its accounting practices.The credit rating agency downgraded the maker of Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese to BBB- from BBB. While the outlook was revised from negative to stable, suggesting no further downgrades are imminent, the move leaves Kraft Heinz’s just one notch away from junk status. Both Fitch and Moody’s also have Kraft at one step above junk.The food giant revealed in February it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation into the company’s accounting and controls. The news, delivered alongside a disastrous set of fourth-quarter results that saw the company take a $15bn writedown and cut its dividend by one-third, prompted a sharp sell-off in the stock and the departure of Bernardo Hees as chief executive.The company was forced to restate nearly three years of results in May following an internal probe into the accounting errors.The SEC investigation remains ongoing. In its note on Thursday, analysts at S&P said in addition to regulatory issues, the company faces an uphill battle to reverse falling sales growth. Like other packaged goods company Kraft Heinz is grappling with quickly changing shopper tastes that favour fresh products over processed ones and rising competition from smaller, more nimble brands.“Our view of the company’s business is diminished, including our expectation that certain key brands are unlikely to grow sales without discounting or successful innovation — which has not historically been a company strength — and doubts about the long-term success of the 3G cost-cutting strategy. We also believe there are governance deficiencies around internal controls, poor post-Kraft integration cost takeout planning, and the ongoing SEC investigation,” it said.Kraft Heinz now expects to report its quarterly results on or before July 31.
14;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-06-07T22:20:52Z;Kraft Heinz completes internal probe into accounting errors;Chief executive says company ‘returning to a path of normalisation’;Kraft Heinz moved a step closer to resolving problems with its accounting as it said an internal investigation did not identify any misconduct by the senior management team. An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission continues, however.The company behind Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese disclosed last month that it would restate three years of results after an internal probe uncovered serious accounting problems.The investigation, launched after Kraft Heinz received a subpoena from the SEC, found evidence of misconduct in its procurement operations, the company said last month. The company had improperly accounted for arrangements with suppliers, which it described as “complex”. In particular, there were problems in how it had recognised costs and rebates.The internal probe revealed the cost of products sold were understated by $208m over a period of four years but the misstatements were not material. “The cumulative impact of the restatements to previously reported amounts from 2015 to 2018 is less than 1 per cent of net income . . . for each applicable period,” the company said.Kraft Heinz now expects to report its quarterly results on or before July 31.The Warren Buffett-backed company said it is “taking actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal control over financial reporting”.“We are pleased that Kraft Heinz is returning to a path of normalisation,” said Alex Behring, chairman.In addition to procurement, the SEC is also examining a $15bn writedown that Kraft Heinz took in February.Kraft Heinz shares, which are down more than 33 per cent so far this year, rose 2.1 per cent to $29.34 in after-hours trade on Friday.
15;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-05-18T04:00:26Z;Cashew foie gras? Big Food jumps on ‘plant-based’ bandwagon;Boom in meat and dairy substitutes sets up ‘battle for the centre of the plate’;First came the vegetarians, then the vegans, followed by a bewildering array of food tribes from veggievores, flexitarians and meat reducers to pescatarians and lacto-vegetarians. If the profusion of terms for people who have cut their meat or dairy intake is anything to go by, a change is afoot that is set to sweep through the global food industry as once-niche dietary movements join the mainstream.Fast-food chain Burger King has partnered with a “foodtech” start-up, and McDonald’s with Nestlé, to put meat-free burgers on their menus. Pret A Manger is considering a surge in its roll-out of vegetarian outlets as it looks into buying UK sandwich rival Eat.But at the other end of the supply chain, Big Food is getting in on the act as the emergence of plant-based substitutes opens the door for meat market disruption. “This is a battle for the centre of the plate,” said Justin Sherrard, a strategist at Rabobank, referring to the western practice of building meals around a piece of protein with vegetables on the side.The prize will be huge if imitation meat matches adoption levels of milk product alternatives such as soy yoghurt and almond milk, which account for 13 per cent of the American dairy market. It is a $35bn opportunity in the US alone, according to newly listed producer Beyond Meat, given the country’s $270bn market for animal-based food. Packaged food producers, burdened with anaemic growth in segments from drinks to sweets, have jumped on the plant-based bandwagon. Market leaders including Danone, Nestlé and Unilever are investing heavily in acquisitions and internal product development.Laggards are dipping their toes. Kraft-Heinz, for example, is investing in start-ups via its corporate venture capital arm and making vegan variants of some of its products. Even traditional meat producers, such as US-based Tyson Foods and Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods, are diversifying into plant-based offerings to remain relevant with consumers. “Plant-based is not a threat,” said Wayne England, who leads Nestlé’s food strategy. “On the contrary, it’s a great opportunity for us. Many of our existing brands can play much more in this space than they do today, so we’re accelerating that shift, and there is also space for new brands.” Nestlé aims to reach SFr1bn ($1bn) in sales from plant-based products within a decade. While small in the context of its total annual sales of SFr91.4bn, Mr England said the sector is a priority. The company has a lot riding on the recent launch in Europe of Garden Gourmet’s Incredible burger, which is designed to cook and “bleed” like real meat, with the US to follow in the autumn. In a sign of the times, Nestlé has put its Herta cold-cuts brand up for sale — but is keeping hold of the unit’s vegetarian and dough products. From cashew “foie gras” to fake shrimp made of algae, a plethora of alternative protein products are hitting supermarket shelves. They appeal to consumers for different reasons, industry executives say, with some wanting to reduce their meat consumption for health reasons and others concerned about animal welfare and agriculture’s contribution to climate change. France’s Danone, known for Activia yoghurt and Evian water, has gone the furthest in putting plant-based at the centre of its strategy. Emmanuel Faber, chief executive, has promised to triple sales of plant-based products to €5bn by 2025, which would account for a fifth of group revenue at current levels. But some investors have questioned whether Danone overpaid for its $12.5bn acquisition of WhiteWave, an upmarket US producer of alternative milks in 2016. As Big Food rushes in, it faces stiff competition from a new breed of start-ups that have raced ahead to launch plant-based meats they claim look, taste and feel like the real thing. Flush with venture capital funding, they have turned to technology, analysing the molecular structure of foods and seeking to reverse-engineer versions using plant proteins. Beyond Meat, whose market capitalisation has more than tripled to $5.5bn in the two weeks since its initial public offering, and rival Impossible Foods have big ambitions to convert even the most committed carnivores to their cause. “We can win on taste, we can win on nutrition and if we can get the price of this to be lower than the cost of animal protein, very few consumers are going to be like, nah, I’m not going to do it,” said chief executive Ethan Brown of Beyond Meat. Not only are the disrupters innovating on the product side, they are rapidly creating new brands using digital marketing and partnerships with restaurants. Big food companies, which can struggle to create new brands, often rely on acquisitions to bring new ones onboard. In a sign of the branding savvy of the start-ups, Impossible Foods’ distribution deal with Burger King in the US is for the “Impossible Whopper”, giving the new brand double-billing with the fast-food chain. In contrast, when McDonald’s chose Nestlé’s Garden Gourmet Incredible Burger for sale in Germany, it coined its own name, the “Big Vegan TS”, with the foodmaker’s branding nowhere to be seen in stores. Aside from the quality of the new protein substitutes, how they are marketed will determine whether they become truly mass-market or remain limited to the margins of motivated vegetarians and vegans. The positioning of the product in stores influences sales, with new brands such as Beyond Meat pushing to be placed in the meat section rather than separate chilled cabinets alongside the vegetarian and vegan options. Elio Leoni Sceti, whose investment company recently backed NotCo, a Chile-based start-up that uses machine learning to create vegetarian replicas of meat and dairy, believes new brands have an edge on the marketing side because they are not held back by old habits. “The new consumer looks at the consequences of consumption and believes that health and beauty come from within,” said one industry veteran who used to run Birds Eye owner Iglo. “They’re less convinced by the functional-based arguments that food companies are used to making, like less sugar or fewer calories. This is not the way that consumers used to make decisions so the old guard are flummoxed.” For big meat producers, the risk that people will gradually reduce their consumption poses a more existential threat, although with global demand still strong, such a change does not seem imminent. Addressing investors at a New York conference this week, Tyson chief executive Noel White explained the meat group’s plan to launch a plant-based product this summer. The largest meatpacker in the US owned a stake in Beyond Meat before selling ahead of the IPO. “It came to the point in time where we decided that we were going to enter that market ourselves, and do it in a meaningful way,” he said. He added that the product could eventually deliver $1bn in revenue, and played down the capital investment required, saying the project would draw on existing supply chain and distribution resources. Canada’s Maple Leaf Foods, which bought two plant-based brands in 2017 for $270m, announced this year that it would spend $310m constructing a plant-based product facility in Indiana. Dan Curtin, who heads Greenleaf, the company’s plant-based business, played down the idea that alternative meats will eat into meat sales, saying the substitutes were “additive”. “We don’t see this as a replacement. People want options,” he said. Despite these initial forays, most large meat producers are not betting as much on plant-based foods as their consumer goods counterparts. That is partly because of continued growth in meat demand, as well as a reluctance to enter an increasingly crowded market without a distinct offering. But the landscape is changing fast. The meat makers, said Mr Sherrard, “need to realise” that if they are not careful, consumer food companies could eat their lunch.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New YorkA hot dog made headlines in London this month. It looked like any other pork frankfurter in a bun — except it was made from seeds. And had a £13 price tag.The Moving Mountains hot dog, which was 12 months and nearly £1m in development, claims to be a “world first”: a plant-based sausage that tastes like real pork. The company’s founder, Simeon van der Molen, said that in a blind taste test three-quarters of meat-eaters were fooled. The hot dog will sell in restaurants for between £10 and £13.The product is one of the latest examples of how restaurants and supermarkets are catering to the rapidly growing number of “flexitarians” — consumers who like meat but want to eat less of it.But one sticking point is price. Given the general impression that vegetables are cheaper than meat, some chains have faced a backlash from customers expecting more of a saving.In January, UK pub company Young’s came under fire for pricing a cauliflower steak at £14 — the same as its Aberdeen Angus beef version. The company defended the price, saying both dishes were “premium quality”, but under pressure from social media users it pulled it from the menu.British upmarket food and clothing retailer Marks and Spencer similarly encountered criticism from customers last year when it launched a “cauliflower steak”. The product, made of two slices of the vegetable, with a dressing, was initially priced at £2, double the cost of an entire cauliflower. M&S swiftly pulled it from its food range.Chantelle Nicholson, group operations director for chef Marcus Wareing’s restaurants, said profit margins on vegan dishes were not much better than for meat.“In terms of cost of ingredients it may be cheaper . . . but anything that is plant-based has a huge amount more work in it. Everything on that plate is made from scratch,” she said.The plant-based tasting menu at Tredwells, one of the group’s London restaurants, costs £39 for five courses, compared with £45 for meat. A meat-free Beyond Meat burger at UK chain Honest is £2 more than the beef version, such is the cost of buying it in.British bakery chain Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll this year that became a Twitter sensation. The snack is 5p more expensive than its meaty counterpart, which the company said was “reflective of the core ingredients”.Still, there are signs some consumers are willing to pay for meat-free alternatives.Moving Mountains last year launched its bleeding meat-free burger, which costs about £10.

16;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;M&A bonanza poses an impairment threat for investors;Huge amounts of goodwill sit on companies’ balance sheets as global growth looks shaky;"Global merger and acquisition volumes reached their third-highest year on record in 2018, continuing a trend that has seen dealmaking steadily increase since the financial crisis. All this M&A means that there are huge amounts of goodwill sitting on companies’ balance sheets — which bring the potential of similarly large impairments with them. We think investors should be paying this more attention.So far, the scale of impairments has not been a big concern. With interest rates still at historically low levels and the global economy growing strongly in recent years, investors have largely been content to assume that firms have paid fair prices for the acquisitions they have made.Today, however, the sustainability of global growth appears far from certain. So the rosy assumptions on which many balance sheets rest look less assured. And that could have serious implications for corporate profitability in the future.Curtailed profits have obvious implications for share prices. But impairments are not only a concern for equity investors. They can also trigger bond covenants — entailing new equity raises, renegotiation of covenants or ratings downgrades. Accordingly, all investors should take them seriously.Recently, we have started to see some eye-catching — indeed, eye-watering — impairments. General Electric (GE) is an obvious example. In October, the company wrote off $23bn from the acquisition of Alstom. This acquisition had cost GE just $10.1bn, but Alstom’s hefty liabilities resulted in a negative book value even before the impairment.Then there’s the case of Kraft Heinz. In February, the company recorded a $7.3bn goodwill impairment. The impact on its share price was immediate; its stock lost more than a quarter of its value on the day of the announcement.What is interesting is that the main cause of the GE and Kraft impairments related to large acquisitions conducted in 2015. Indeed there is some evidence inferring that impairment charges are perhaps more likely two to three years post transaction.So, do these high-profile examples herald a wave of significant impairments elsewhere? We think they might. For one thing, the size of the recent M&A boom means there’s a much higher proportion of goodwill on balance sheets than in the past. In the recent buying bonanza, the premium paid above a target’s book value was typically well above 20 per cent. If GDP growth slows and cost pressures rise, justifying such large asset values is going to prove more difficult.Impairments are not always bad news in themselves. Sometimes they occur because incoming management teams are keen to write off goodwill so that they can start with a clean slate — as was the case with GE. Conversely, though, incumbent managements can be reluctant to recognise impairments, because this is tantamount to admitting that they have overpaid for assets. And who wants to admit to a mistake?We think it’s particularly important to look out for instances in which a company is revising down its future earnings but not taking goodwill impairment charges. Given the subjectivity afforded to company managements in testing goodwill, a lack of impairments can’t be used to assume that all is well. This is especially true when writedowns become widespread in a given sector. Are the exceptions genuinely different or, given the ample room for manoeuvre afforded to managements by the testing process, are they hiding something?Some sectors are likely to be more vulnerable to impairments than others. In our screening, we focus on companies with goodwill as a high percentage of total reported assets. We overlay this with an analysis of sectoral margins, focusing particularly on high exposure to rising labour costs. Our analysis suggests that healthcare, technology and media companies may be among those most at risk.This sector-based screening helps. Ultimately, though, there’s no substitute for subjecting individual companies’ accounting disclosures to rigorous analysis. This needs to involve scrutiny of the discount rate applied and the impact that any change in it will have on the valuation of the goodwill on the balance sheet. Particular attention needs to be given to whether the discount rates reflect the current cost of capital.It’s also important to engage with audit firms, to ascertain their view of the management’s attitude to impairment tests. How many investors fully read all the audit statements in financial statements? Perhaps investors should put pressure on companies and hence indirectly their auditors to include more disclosure surrounding how the audit has considered goodwill assessments.Comparisons with sector peers can be illuminating too, and the focus on goodwill impairment tests should form part of a wider forensic-accounting screen that covers other factors such as off-balance-sheet financing and material provisions.None of this is easy, and there are no short-cuts. But for bottom-up investors with the requisite skills, energy and resources, a focus on goodwill impairment may yield vital insights into future profitability — and into the performance of bonds and shares.Nicholas Kordowski is head of non-financials fixed-income research at Aberdeen Standard Investments"
17;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-05-10T03:49:01Z;‘I’m not 3G’s man’, says new Kraft Heinz chief executive;After years of cost cuts, food group turns to Miguel Patricio to make its brands ‘shine’;Miguel Patricio, Kraft Heinz’s incoming chief executive, is prepared to stand up for his brands. He was working for AmBev in Brazil when Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared at an event the brewer put on for the Rio Carnival. The muscle-bound actor was supposed to wear a top emblazoned with the company’s Brahma beer logo but had shown up without one.“I went and said ‘Look my friend, these are the rules’,” the 52-year-old recalled in an interview. “‘If you are not going to put the jersey on, you are not welcome in this place’. He said, ‘I’m not going to put it on. I’m going to leave’. I said, ‘OK, leave.’”Fifteen years later, Mr Patricio also appears undaunted by the task facing him at Kraft Heinz, the Warren Buffett-backed food group that has become one of corporate America’s biggest turnround jobs.The Chicago-based company behind Kraft macaroni and cheese, Heinz salad cream and Amoy soy sauce, was forced to take a $15bn writedown this year as more shoppers shunned its brands.This week Kraft Heinz restated almost three years worth of earnings after an internal investigation uncovered errors in the way it had accounted for supplier contracts. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.He’s not a sit-back kind of guy. He likes actionBernardo Hees, who led the 2015 combination of Kraft and Heinz in a deal engineered by the investment firm 3G Capital, will stand aside as chief executive at the end of June.Mr Patricio is connected to 3G through his lengthy career at AmBev, which turned into Anheuser-Busch InBev through several large mergers and acquisitions orchestrated by the same trio of Brazilian billionaires who founded 3G.But the new Kraft Heinz boss brushes aside concerns that his appointment is not enough of a break from 3G, whose management style and relentless focus on costs have been blamed in some quarters for many of the company’s problems.I’m not 3G’s man,” he says. “I’m not a partner at 3G, I don’t have investments with 3G, and by the way, ABI is not part of 3G.”[Kraft Heinz later said Mr Patricio had mispoken and he had a small investment in one of the 3G funds.]Born and brought up in Lisbon, the Benfica fan moved to Brazil when he was a teenager. He took a business degree in São Paulo and simultaneously studied history at night school. “I like [working] the two sides of the brain,” he explained. “I love math, but I love the creative part as well.” He soon found a sweet spot in marketing consumer goods.Mr Patricio got his start in Brazil at Johnson & Johnson, which moved him to New Jersey five years later. He left to work in marketing for Coca-Cola at its Atlanta headquarters, before the cigarette company Philip Morris lured him back to Brazil.He joined AmBev soon after and climbed up the ranks of the brewer for two decades, with postings from Luxemburg to Shanghai, before Alex Behring, co-founder of 3G and Kraft Heinz’s chairman, approached him this year to make the move to Chicago.As ABI’s chief marketing officer for six years, Mr Patricio had a portfolio of some of the world’s biggest beer brands, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois.Jason DeLand, founding partner of the Anomaly marketing agency, said marketing “had been seen as an expense, not an investment” at ABI before Mr Patricio. “He convinced the organisation to focus on creativity as the number one mechanism to fuel organic growth,” Mr DeLand said.“He’s not a sit-back kind of guy,” said Dave Luhr of the ad agency Wieden+Kennedy. “He likes action.”Kraft Heinz, whose shares have lost almost a quarter of their value so far this year, is certainly in need of a shake-up. The accounting problems have already caused it to miss a submission deadline for its 2018 annual report, and this week the company said its SEC filing for the first quarter of 2019 would also be delayed.Asked about his accounting and financial experience, Mr Patricio makes clear he should not be seen as just an advertising guy. He was president of “some of the biggest” divisions of ABI, including Asia-Pacific, and is credited with rapid expansion in emerging markets.Mr Patricio does not take the hot seat at Kraft Heinz until the start of July, but has already moved to Chicago to learn the ropes. His wife, who once worked for Kraft in Brazil, will follow from Connecticut with the couple’s three teenage daughters.As well as taking the daughters to football and ballet, he spends his time outside work cooking, a helpful pastime given his new role at the helm of one of the world’s biggest food companies. “I’m in the right business, finally,” he joked.He has yet to set out his strategy for Kraft Heinz, but thinks the big challenge will be navigating a changing industry. “Everything is changing: retail, private label, even [consumer] values, health and wellbeing. But at the same time that it’s a big transformation, it’s a big opportunity.”Describing himself as a “brand builder”, he said Kraft Heinz had “very good, iconic, brands . . . Some shining, some are not. But, you know, we can make them [all] shine.”
18;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-05-06T17:00:40Z;Kraft Heinz to restate earnings as accounting probe widens ;Food company says it found employee misconduct and that SEC sent second subpoena;Kraft Heinz has been forced to restate nearly three years of results, after an internal investigation uncovered serious accounting problems at the Warren Buffett-backed food company.An internal probe, launched after the company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, found evidence of “misconduct” in its procurement operations, Kraft Heinz said on Monday.The company behind Philadelphia Cream Cheese and HP Sauce also disclosed that the SEC had widened a probe into its accounting. In addition to procurement, the regulator was now examining a $15bn writedown that Kraft Heinz took in February.While the company said discrepancies uncovered during an internal investigation were not “quantitatively material”, more than $180m in adjustments would be required to fix errors in previously issued accounts for 2016, 2017 and the first three quarters of 2018.Only a minority of the sum related to employee misconduct, said a person with knowledge of the situation, who added that several individuals had left the company as a result of the investigation.Kraft Heinz had improperly accounted for arrangements with suppliers, which the company described as “complex”. In particular, there were problems in how it had recognised costs and rebates.“The review identified additional misstatements, which may or may not have resulted from the misconduct,” Kraft Heinz said. Rebates and upfront payments from suppliers, some of which had been contingent upon future events, had been booked too soon instead of over the length of the contracts, it said.The effect was to flatter short-term profits. Kraft Heinz, whose accounts are audited by PwC, said the required changes equated to between 0.7 and 1.5 per cent of adjusted profits in each of the three years in question.Its internal inquiry, which the company said was substantially complete, did not identify any wrongdoing by any member of the senior management team. The company was taking “remedial actions” and was making “improvements to its internal controls”, it said.Kraft Heinz has already missed a submission deadline for its 2018 annual report and its earnings filing for the first quarter of 2019 would also be delayed, it said. Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, a big shareholder, said on Saturday that its own first-quarter earnings were incomplete because it could not yet properly account for its Kraft Heinz stake.Kraft Heinz’s chief executive Bernardo Hees said last month he was leaving the company. He is being replaced by Miguel Patricio, a marketing executive from the brewer AB InBev.The second SEC subpoena, received in March, covered the company’s “assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments”, as well as demands for more detail about its procurement arrangements.On top of the $180m misstatements related to procurement and supplier contracts, the company also said on Monday that it had identified some errors in how it had calculated the $15bn writedown. The impairment losses were $13m higher. Shares in Kraft Heinz, which have lost about 44 per cent over the past year, were modestly higher in early New York trading.
19;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-29T03:00:25Z;Mavericks from marketing merit a shot at becoming CEO;The unjust caricature of the marketing director as a flash creative still lingers;Marketers have been celebrating this week after of one of their own — brewer AB InBev’s former chief marketing officer Miguel Patricio — was named as the new chief executive of Kraft Heinz.His appointment looks like the apotheosis of years of articles, written about, for, and sometimes by marketing people, hyping the idea that CMOs are the obvious choice for CEO. Unsurprisingly, marketers are good at marketing themselves.One obvious retort is: be careful what you wish for. Kraft Heinz sales have slipped over the past three years of cost-cutting. If a marketer cannot spice up growth in some of the best known brands in our fridges and store cupboards, it is hard to see who could. But if Mr Patricio fails, it could confound the prospects of other brand handlers with an eye on the boardroom hot seat.Chief marketing officers usually do not step out of ad campaign brainstorming sessions and straight into the corner office. When Egon Zehnder, the executive search firm, asked 402 chief executives last year about their prior role, only 2 per cent said they had been CMO, against 31 per cent who had previously headed a business unit.A seasoned chair (and former marketing man) told me that if the nominations committee does not plump for a divisional head, the “low-risk decision” is to choose the chief financial officer, rather than the CMO.Perhaps the unjust caricature of the marketing director as a flash creative, more slogan than substance, still lingers. By contrast, former CFOs, who accounted for 8 per cent of the chief executives in the Egon Zehnder poll, seem to have the right rapport with investors, knowledge of the balance sheet, and regular interaction with directors to reassure the board.Cut the CEO’s curriculum a different way, though, and a marketing pedigree often shines through.A survey by another headhunter, Heidrick & Struggles, suggests more than one in 10 chief executives in the US and western Europe have served in marketing or sales roles. In the Netherlands and Denmark, you are as likely to find a chief executive with a marketing background as one with experience in finance or general management.Chief executives of other US food companies such as ConAgra and General Mills have marketing on their résumés. Steve Easterbrook moved from chief brand officer of McDonald’s to the chief executive job in 2015. Diane Dietz, chief executive of Rodan + Fields, a direct-sales skincare brand, was CMO of grocer Safeway, and Jeff Jones, who now heads H&R Block, the tax preparation company, held that role at retailer Target.It remains an exaggeration to call marketing a route to the top. It is a long road from branding trainee at Procter & Gamble to chief executive. What links those CEOs with Mr Patricio is that they acquired a breadth of other experience, in finance, operations or divisional roles, as they rose.It increasingly does make sense, though, for recruiters to seek out candidates who understand marketing.According to the chairman with the marketing background, often, when projects fail to achieve predicted returns, it is not because the team has skimped on the risk assessment or messed up the financing, but because they “didn’t get the marketing right”. As for the finance director’s talent for investor relations, a good new CEO “can pick that up in six months”.In 1974, expanding on his famous dictum that the purpose of business was “to create a customer”, Peter Drucker wrote that businesses required only two basic functions, innovation and marketing. The aim of the latter was not to sell, but to “understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself”.As marketers find new ways, through social media and data analysis, to fulfil Drucker’s goal of understanding the customer, they are likely to feature more frequently on CEO shortlists. Crowning them chief executive is not the only way to harness their insights, of course. As another chairman told me, simply having a talented marketer as part of the top team may be sufficient.But given their focus on change leadership and knowledge of the customer, marketing directors may be more closely aligned with the chief executive than other senior managers, according to Kristi Maynor of Egon Zehnder. Titles and experience apart, CMOs often have the right mindset to combine an eye for data with an understanding of “emotion and the human connection”.If nothing else, that ought to be enough to shift nomination committees’ attitudes to mavericks from the marketing department from “why would we consider them for the top job?” to “why not?”andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill
20;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-26T20:30:24Z;Warren Buffett ready to buy in Britain regardless of Brexit;Billionaire investor is looking beyond US for large acquisitions;Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said he is “ready to buy something in the UK tomorrow”, handing a big endorsement to Britain ahead of Brexit.“We welcome the chance to put money out any place where we think we understand and sort of trust the system,” the 88-year-old told the Financial Times in a broad-ranging interview. “We’re never going to understand any other culture or the tax laws or the customs as well as the US, but we can come awfully close in Britain.”Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate Mr Buffett runs, has had a mixed record in the UK, where its modest investments have included a stake in supermarket chain Tesco and ownership of an electricity provider in northern England.However, the “sage of Omaha” said he was still willing to invest in Britain — regardless of whether the UK left the EU.He has complained that acquisitions large enough to make a dent in the more than $100bn that Berkshire has to spend are becoming harder to find in the US amid competition from private equity firms.We are known outside the United States but we don’t have the same position in people’s mindsMr Buffett told Berkshire shareholders this year that the company hoped to “invest significant sums across borders”, which would mark a big shift in a 54-year career that has focused on the US.In Europe, takeover activity has slowed sharply, potentially opening the door to a buyer such as Berkshire. He referred to the challenges facing the EU, which is grappling with rising populism, a slowing economy and tension over the future of the European project.He said it was “very tough” for the EU to find a balance between “autonomy and common interest”, pointing out that the countries spoke different languages and had “entirely different fiscal situations”.He added: “It doesn’t surprise me that there would be a lot of tensions, and sometimes maybe impossible tensions even.”In the UK, Mr Buffett has previously called his investment in Tesco a “huge mistake” after shares in the supermarket chain lost 60 per cent of their value between 2008 and 2015. One of his most recent attempts to invest in Britain fell apart two years ago when Kraft Heinz, the US food group that counts Mr Buffett as its biggest shareholder, abandoned a hostile $143bn bid to buy Anglo-Dutch rival Unilever.Berkshire’s ownership of Northern Powergrid, which distributes electricity to homes and businesses in the north-east of England, has worked out better. The business delivers a steady $1bn in revenues and $300m in profits every year. His insurance businesses are also active in London’s commercial and wholesale insurance markets where Ajit Jain, one of Mr Buffett’s most trusted lieutenants, is a well-known figure. Mr Buffett has concentrated his firepower on the US, with only one of Berkshire’s 10 largest purchases, which include its $36bn takeover of railroad BNSF and $10bn buyout of utility NV Energy, for a company outside the US, according to data provider Refinitiv. In 2014, it acquired AltaLink, a Canadian electric utility, for $5.5bn from SNC-Lavalin. The company’s $173bn share portfolio is also concentrated in US groups such as iPhone maker Apple and drinks group Coca-Cola.Mr Buffett believes that he is partly hampered by a lack of recognition beyond US borders. “We are known outside the United States but we don’t have the same position in people’s minds. “If somebody has a private business here of size, they think of us if they’re going to sell it. They may only think of us for 10 seconds but we cross their radar screen. In Europe, they know of us but I don’t think they necessarily think of us,” he said.

Read the story by DD’s Arash Massoudi and team here.US food conglomerate Kraft Heinz has had a difficult few months, even by packaged food company standards. So it was hardly a surprise when the group’s chief executive, Bernardo Hees, announced he would be stepping down in the summer.Hees has been fighting an uphill battle. Almost four years since NY-based investment firm 3G Capital (below, Brazilian co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, left, and Hees) engineered the $63bn megamerger of Kraft and Heinz, the company has lost more than half its market capitalisation.It all came to a head in February when Kraft Heinz announced a disastrous set of results that included the trifecta of a $15bn writedown, a regulatory investigation into the company’s controls and a dividend cut.The results even prompted Warren Buffett — who doesn’t like to make a habit of putting a foot wrong — to admit Berkshire Hathaway, which has a 26.7 per cent stake in the company, had overpaid for Kraft’s merger with Heinz.It’s therefore safe to say that Kraft Heinz’s newly appointed boss, Miguel Patricio, will have a lot on his plate as he tries to revive the group’s fortunes write the FT’s Alistair Gray and DD’s own James Fontanella-Khan.The former marketing executive at brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, has his own recipe for success. Speaking to the Financial Times following his appointment, Patricio said he wanted the group to anticipate new consumer trends rather than react to them.“If we can understand the next market trends we can lead the future and win,” he said, adding that he brought a “new background” to the top job.It’s a strict departure from the lean and mean approach adopted by 3G and Hees himself — the investment company is known less for its marketing prowess and more for its intense focus on cost-cutting. It might be just what Kraft Heinz needs.“The real question is whether their pick for CEO can really impose a new culture and mentality within the firm,” said one leading sector adviser. “More of the same won’t work now. They need to change fast.”Patricio is still connected to the investment group through a two-decade career at ABI. The drinks company is backed by the same trio of Brazilians, including Lemann, who founded 3G.The Portuguese national was responsible for beer brands including Corona and Stella Artois at AB InBev and marketing initiatives under his watch included a rebranding of Budweiser as “America” as well as the roll-out of limited edition National Football League cans for Bud Light.While Patricio has built his career in marketing — a field companies are leaning on as they try to lure in increasingly sceptical shoppers — there are considerable challenges facing him at Kraft Heinz, including a heavy debt load and the consumer’s loss of appetite for big brands.Lovers of irony and symbolism, look away. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority had been due to kill off the takeover of Asda by Sainsbury’s on April 30 — exactly a year after it was formally announced.On Tuesday it said the last rites will instead be read on April 25 — five days before the statutory deadline, reports the FT’s Jonathan Eley. That gives Sainsbury’s, in particular, a few extra days to weigh its next move before it reports full-year results on May 1.Despite a valedictory fightback from the two companies, including a commitment to lop £1bn off prices in the stores, few see any real prospect of the regulator changing its initial views enough to allow the transaction to proceed.Back in February, it said the combination would harm competition on both a local and national level, and that only a massive sale of stores and one of the brand names to a rival operator would mitigate that damage.What happens next? The companies could challenge the verdict via a judicial review. But this would be time-consuming and expensive, with uncertain prospects of success. Walmart may conclude that maintaining a presence in the UK is not such a terrible outcome — especially now that Asda has taken the number two slot from Sainsbury’s, according to Kantar data.Walmart could also pursue a sale of Asda to private equity, but sector-watchers see several problems with this. One is price: without cost savings, a financial buyer couldn’t pay Walmart as much as Sainsbury’s was prepared to offer. Another is exit: how would a KKR or a Blackstone get out in three to five years’ time, given that the CMA has effectively blocked any sale to a rival and appetite for retail IPOs is virtually non-existent?For Sainsbury’s, the challenges are more immediate: it is losing market share to a resurgent Tesco, and social media is awash with photographs of checkout queues and poorly stocked shelves. Mike Coupe, chief executive, is likely to face questions about how he plans to reinvigorate operational performance, not least from his new chairman, Martin Scicluna.CLSA, the brokerage owned by Chinese state-controlled Citic Securities, has sought to end a month-long leadership crisis with the appointment of a new chief executive.A clash between management at CLSA and Citic burst into the open in March when its chairman Tang Zhenyi (right), its longtime chief executive Jonathan Slone (left) and its chief operating officer Nigel Beattie left the group.The fracture has been chalked up to long-stewing grievances between Chinese state control and the Hong Kong-based broker known for its pull-no-punches commentary, as well as a political shift in China against increased openness to the outside world. More here on how the relationship went wrong.The departures came as a shock. Slone started his career at CLSA in 1988. Tang had served at Citic and China’s ministry of finance. The marriage was relatively fresh. Citic bought CLSA from France’s Crédit Agricole in 2013, paying $1.25bn as part of a push to bolster its international reach. Both companies have several decades of separate history.Zhang Youjun, the chairman of Citic, quickly assumed the chairmanship at CLSA but the CEO spot has remained open since late MarchRichard Gould, CLSA’s current chief executive in the Americas, will be moved from New York to Hong Kong to take the top job, the company said on Tuesday. Having joined in 2014, he doesn’t have the deep connections to the company that Slone did.Before that he was the global head of sales at Bloomberg Tradebook, and also spent more than 20 years at Morgan Stanley in roles including sales, research and management. Here’s more on the latest leadership changes from the FT.The company has a number of challenges ahead of it, not least reconciling the deep divides between Citic and CLSA.

22;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-23T11:11:30Z;Kraft Heinz’s new chief faces stern test to revive food group;Struggling maker of Philadelphia cream cheese turns to marketing executive to boost sales;As Bernardo Hees this week told Kraft Heinz employees that he would be stepping down as chief executive, the Brazilian insisted on how “proud” he was of the company’s achievements.Profit margins at the group behind brands including Philadelphia cream cheese, Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Maxwell House coffee were “world leading”, he wrote in a memo to employees. Sales had at least kept pace with US peers in the struggling industry.Investors have lately taken a less upbeat view of Kraft Heinz, created by the 2015 merger of two of America’s best known food groups in a deal engineered by the investment firm 3G Capital and backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. The company has since lost more than half its market capitalisation, with Wall Street increasingly worried by an over-reliance on cost cuts to drive returns.Mr Hees’ departure comes just weeks after a disastrous set of results in which the company took a $15bn writedown, cut its dividend by one-third and revealed the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its accounting in procurement.“Something needed to be done,” said John Baumgartner, packaged food analyst at Wells Fargo. “There was a low degree of confidence in the investment community with the status quo.”However, Kraft Heinz’s choice of Miguel Patricio, a marketing executive from AB InBev, the brewer behind Budweiser beer, as the next chief executive has raised concerns over whether the change is enough to mark a clean break from a 3G approach best known for cost cutting and ambitious acquisitions.Mr Patricio is not a 3G partner, as Mr Hees was, although he is connected to the investment group through a two-decade career at AB InBev. The drinks company is backed by the same trio of Brazilians, including billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, who founded 3G.“The real question is whether their pick for CEO can really impose a new culture and mentality within the firm,” said one leading sector adviser. “More of the same won’t work now. They need to change fast.”After an initial rally early on Monday, Kraft Heinz shares are little changed since the announcement. The stock has dropped by almost a quarter this year.“The company is still significantly controlled by 3G,” said Chris Growe, an analyst at Stifel.As global chief marketing officer at AB InBev for six years, Mr Patricio, a Portuguese national who attended business school in Brazil, was responsible for beer brands including Corona and Stella Artois. Marketing initiatives under his watch included a rebranding of Budweiser as “America” and the roll-out of limited edition National Football League cans for Bud Light.Mr Patricio, who will take the top job in July, joins a list of new chief executives in a consumer packaged goods sector grappling with quickly changing shopper tastes and rising competition from retailers developing their own, cheaper, versions of the same products. Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Campbell Soup have also changed leaders in recent months.In an echo of the background of some of the other newly-appointed leaders in the sector, Mr Patricio has built his career in marketing — a field companies are leaning on as they try to convince increasingly sceptical shoppers that big, well-established brands are still alluring. Other new chief executives with strong marketing pedigrees include Sean Connolly at ConAgra and Jeffrey Harmening of General Mills.“Increasingly, marketing folks are getting the nod to CEO,” said Doug Ehrenkranz, managing partner at the executive search firm Boyden who specialises in consumer goods. “That used to be the exception, not the rule.”Noting the rising importance of consumer analytics and research, Mr Ehrenkranz said marketing in large part determined the products that companies such as Kraft Heinz sell. “The real heavy lifting comes months and even years before the marketing campaigns are devised,” he said.Speaking to the Financial Times following his appointment, Mr Patricio said he wanted the group to anticipate new consumer trends rather than react to them. “If we can understand the next market trends we can lead the future and win,” he said, adding that he brought a “new background” to the top job.One former colleague at AB InBev says he was seen as a “talent builder” at the brewer, who was not afraid to ask difficult questions. “He was a champion for marketing to experiment more. He has a healthy belief in the power of investing in the equity of brands.”Yet the challenges facing him at Kraft Heinz are considerable. While attacking costs have helped push operating margins comfortably above 20 per cent, the top line has been decidedly sluggish. The company, which has headquarters in Chicago and Pittsburgh, generated sales of $26.3bn in 2018, down about 4 per cent from 2015 levels.While the 52-year-old gave few immediate details of his strategy, he made clear his focus would be to grow organically rather than by acquisition, which has long been a hallmark of 3G. That marks a change in emphasis from Mr Hees, who signalled even after the release of the alarming earnings in February that Kraft Heinz had an appetite for more deals.The options for growth are constrained by the company’s long-term debt burden, which stood at $30.9bn at the end of last year.Mr Baumgartner added that there was still room for Kraft Heinz to expand — perhaps in product categories where it has little presence, such as premium cheese.“Kraft Heinz might not be considered a growth company,” he said. “But the performance could certainly be better than it has been over the past two years.”
23;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-22T22:15:07Z;Kraft/Miguel Patricio: past as prologue;A blank slate clouded by heavy debt;The easiest way to author a turnround is to step in at the bottom. That is the hope for Miguel Patricio. The longtime AB InBev executive was tapped on Monday to take over the reins at another colossus put together by Brazilian private equity investors, Kraft Heinz.In February, the US food giant reported a flurry of shocking news. This included a goodwill impairment of $15bn, a regulatory investigation into the company’s controls, and forecast fall of a tenth in 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Within a day, more than $15bn of the company’s equity value evaporated.It was a painful moment for Warren Buffett, the company’s largest investor and longtime booster of 3G Capital. The private equity firm, known for big deals and deep cost cuts, is an emblem of aggressive capitalism.Kraft shares have not really budged in the two months since the bad news. Shareholders do not expect a fast turnround. The question for Mr Patricio is whether things will get worse for Kraft before they get better.On Monday, the group thanked departing boss Bernardo Hees, for getting Kraft through its “Phase 1”. That presumably included installing 3G’s controversial austerity system, so-called zero-based budgeting.That could be responsible for falling revenues, as well as industry-leading operating margins of above 20 per cent. Sales have drooped due to disposals and inadequate investment in growing categories. That mis-step is not unique to Kraft. But $30bn of borrowings has exacerbated the decline in equity value.Mr Patricio’s success at brewer AB InBev has been his springboard into Kraft. Kraft’s finances are so bleak that deleveraging is as immediate a goal as innovation. The company’s current debt to ebitda ratio exceeds four times. Even if it keeps investment grade rating, its debt resembles junk in many other respects. Leverage, of course, can also mean a snapback in value. The Portuguese must innovate to justify that.
24;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-22T14:46:52Z;Kraft Heinz replaces CEO after $15bn writedown;Hees departs as group faces SEC probe and questions about strategy;Kraft Heinz’s chief executive is leaving the food company after a profit warning that shook the global consumer goods industry.Bernardo Hees will be replaced at the start of July by Miguel Patricio, an executive at the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, backed by the founders of New York-based investment group 3G Capital, which controls Kraft Heinz.Mr Patricio told the Financial Times on Monday that he was aware of the challenges ahead of him as shoppers shun in increasing numbers the packaged fare that has been the company’s mainstay for decades.Yet the 52-year-old said he was confident he could revive the fortunes of the Chicago-based group, which makes Kraft processed cheese, Heinz tomato ketchup and HP Sauce. “There is nothing sweeter in life than a turnround,” he said.Mr Hees joins a growing list of top executives in the sector to depart in the face of rapidly changing consumer tastes. The chief executives of Unilever, PepsiCo and Colgate-Palmolive are among those to have left in the past few months.However, the sudden decline in fortunes at Kraft Heinz, created in a 2015 mega-merger engineered by 3G and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, has been the industry’s biggest upset in recent years.Kraft Heinz took a $15bn writedown in February to reflect a decline in the value of some of its biggest brands. The company also revealed it had received a subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and cut its dividend by one-third.The ensuing share-price collapse prompted Mr Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has a 27 per cent stake, to admit he had overpaid for Kraft’s merger with Heinz. Mr Buffett and 3G Capital bought Heinz in 2013 and merged it with Kraft two years later, valuing Kraft at $63bn.Kraft Heinz shares ticked up 1.5 per cent on Monday to $33.46, giving it a market capitalisation of $40bn. The Chicago-based company was valued at $89bn when it floated on the stock market in the 2015 deal.Mr Patricio said he wanted Kraft Heinz to anticipate new consumer trends rather than react to them and added that he was open to partnerships with other innovative consumer groups and even universities to help.The incoming chief executive said he would also work on a new growth strategy — but that his focus would predominantly be on organic growth rather than dealmaking, which has long been a hallmark of 3G. That marks a shift in tone from Mr Hees, who signalled even after the profit warning that the company had an appetite for more acquisitions.A native of Portugal, Mr Patricio’s priorities in the first two months include becoming familiar with the company’s workforces, its culture and the numbers behind the business. “Bernardo [Hees] concluded the first phase,” he said in an interview. “I bring to the table a new background.”He has spent two decades at AB InBev, including as global chief marketing officer between 2012 and 2018. Most recently he worked closely with Carlos Brito, the drinks company’s chief executive, as chief special global projects officer.“I can contribute in a different way . . . making the company more consumer-centric,” he said.Mr Patricio, who lives in Connecticut, will relocate to Chicago to take up the position. Insiders said Kraft Heinz’s directors signed off on the appointment at a board meeting last week, having considered several other candidates.They said Mr Hees’ departure was mutual and that the outgoing chief executive would work on other projects for 3G as a partner.Mr Hees, 49, is a long time 3G executive who oversaw the original Heinz purchase and subsequent merger. Alex Behring, the 3G executive who chairs Kraft Heinz, said in a statement: “We appreciate his contributions.”Mr Hees said in the statement: “It has been an honour to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and to see it through its transformation over the past six years. I have confidence that Miguel and the team will take Kraft Heinz to new heights.”
25;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-04-11T10:43:29Z;‘Defensive’ consumer stocks under scrutiny as profit forecasts cut;Food companies under pressure as purchasing tastes change and shoppers shun big brands;Whatever the state of the economy, people still have to eat and wash. That has traditionally made consumer stocks a top pick for investors seeking stability in volatile markets.But Wall Street is reassessing whether makers of soap, cereal and ketchup are really so reliable in a period when rapidly changing consumer tastes undermine the value of big consumer brands.“I’ve been covering this sector for 20 years and I don’t remember a slew of profit warnings like this in such a short period of time,” said James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London.Exhibit A for the critics is Kraft Heinz, whose shares are down about a third since its shock profit warning and deep dividend cut seven weeks ago. The Warren Buffett-backed food company took a $15bn writedown to reflect more downbeat prospects for some of its best-known products, from its signature packaged cheeses to Oscar Mayer hot dogs.Kraft Heinz is the most dramatic example of the challenges, but other consumer stalwarts have also taken a string of cuts in analysts’ earnings estimates.A Financial Times survey of Bloomberg data shows that in the past three months, analysts have lowered profit forecasts for all but five of the 33 consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 index.“There is a lot of disruption. Even compared with just five years ago, the companies have got it much tougher,” said Mr Edwardes Jones.He noted there had also been earnings alerts in Europe at Nivea-maker Beiersdorf, which cut its margin guidance for 2019, and Pritt Stick parent Henkel, which said earnings would dip “in the mid-single percentage range” from last year.For all the recent difficulties, 27 of the S&P 500’s 33 consumer staples stocks are in positive territory so far this year. Overall, the sector has rallied 11 per cent. While that lags behind the 15 per cent advance in the broader S&P 500 index, it is typical for defensive stocks to underperform in rising markets.“Not all earnings downgrades are the same,” said Greg Stanek, portfolio manager at Gilman Hill Asset Management. “The market has been supportive of PepsiCo, which warned about profits due to higher spending to gain market share and launch new products.”Companies in the sector “operate in highly competitive markets” and “a large portion of the sector is in the business of selling sugary drinks and processed food, which is becoming out of favour with consumers,” he said. Still, he added: “The consumer staples companies still have many defensive qualities which would be more valuable in a recession or a more severe slowdown in growth.”For now, though, food companies are under particular pressure from analysts as more consumers opt for fresh produce over the processed fare that has been the industry’s mainstay for decades. Consensus quarterly projections have been reduced over the past three months by 11 per cent for Kellogg, 8 per cent for General Mills and 6 per cent for Hershey.The reductions reflect concerns about margins. Sales are holding up better: revenue estimates are up slightly for 14 of the 33 consumer staples companies, and none has had its top-line forecasts trimmed more than 5 per cent.Profits are being squeezed in part because input costs are rising and the industry has less scope than it once did to respond by raising prices. Shoppers can more easily make pricing comparisons online, and competition from retailers’ own brands is also intensifying.Television and other traditional media are no longer so influential, empowering smaller upstarts that can market their produce on Instagram and sell it on Amazon.“The fundamentals aren’t as rock solid any more,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein. “Barriers to entry in the sector have fallen.”In an attempt to safeguard their future, several traditional companies are reinvesting to drive growth. They include PepsiCo, whose new chief executive Ramon Laguarta has told investors he plans to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional investments. That comes at the expense of short-term profitability: forecasts for the first quarter have been reined in 7 per cent for the company, which is due to report earnings next week.Wall Street has also turned more cautious on the outlook for tobacco companies. Cigarette sales have been declining for years, but recent industry data suggests smokers are abandoning them at an accelerating rate in favour of vaping. Earnings estimates for Marlboro-maker Altria have been cut 7 per cent in the past three months.Makers of household products from shampoo to paper towels are also under pressure, although Mr Dibadj said the pricing competition was not as intense as it was in food.Profit forecasts for Colgate-Palmolive are 6 per cent lower than three months ago. The toothpaste company’s chief executive Ian Cook was replaced this month by Noel Wallace, one of a series of management changes in the sector.“There are few companies in the sector that are as defensive as they used to be,” said Michael Kagan, portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments.
26;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-03-19T21:05:52Z;AB InBev shakes up board after share price slide;Brewer reduces influence of 3G and installs ex-Altria boss Martin Barrington as chair;Anheuser-Busch InBev is set to appoint Martin Barrington, the former chief executive of cigarette maker Altria Group, as its new chairman, in a major governance shake-up that will also see 3G Capital’s managing partner Alexandre Behring leave the board. Carlos Alberto da Veiga Sicupira, the Brazilian billionaire and one of the founders of 3G Capital, is also set to step down, to be replaced by his daughter Cecilia Sicupira.According to people familiar with the matter, the changes are intended to telegraph to shareholders that the brewer’s board is determined to reverse a period of steep share price declines. The maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois is struggling to pay down more than $100bn in debt racked up from acquisitions, and faces slowing demand for beer in its biggest market, the US. Mr Behring’s departure also shows the board wants to signal its distance from 3G Capital, whose founders were instrumental in turning AB InBev into the world’s largest brewer. 3G is renowned for its debt-fuelled dealmaking and ferocious cost-cutting, but the Brazilian-backed private equity group’s methods have fallen out of favour with investors lately with the implosion of packaged foodmaker Kraft Heinz. Mr Behring said: “I’ve decided to step down so I can devote more time to my roles as chairman of two publicly listed companies and managing partner at 3G Capital.”In a statement, AB InBev said the changes would be subject to approval at its annual shareholders’ meeting to be held on April 24.Mr Barrington has served on the AB InBev board since 2016 as a representative of Marlboro producer Altria, which has owned a 10.2 per cent stake since AB InBev took over SABMiller in 2016. At the time of the deal, AB InBev’s shares sat at roughly €114, but they have slumped to €74.30. AB InBev will have to change its bylaws to allow Mr Barrington to become chairman since under current rules only an independent director can serve in the role. He will replace Olivier Goudet, a managing partner at investment company JAB Holdings, who the Financial Times earlier reported was stepping down over concerns that JAB’s activities in beverages overlapped with AB InBev’s forays into non-alcoholic drinks.AB InBev’s 15-member board only has three independent directors, which is few for a company of its size. The board is under the sway of the powerful Brazilian and Belgian families — the former associated with 3G — who orchestrated a series of deals since the 1990s to create the current company. Together they own roughly 43 per cent of the company’s shares, through a vehicle known as Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev and other entities acting in concert.Stéfan Descheemaeker, who is the chief executive of Nomad Foods and represents the Belgian families, will also leave the board. He will be replaced by Sabine Chalmers, who was chief legal officer at AB InBev for over a decade and is now general counsel at the UK telecoms group BT.Mr Goudet’s seat as an independent director will be filled by Xiaozhi Liu, an automobile industry executive from China. 
27;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-03-18T16:50:35Z;Kraft Heinz threatened with potential downgrade by S&P;;Rating agency S&P Global has put Kraft Heinz’s rating on review for a possible downgrade, in a move that could push the struggling packaged food giant’s debt profile closer to junk status.S&P said on Monday it was placing Kraft Heinz’s BBB rating on so-called credit watch, with negative implications after the company behind Heinz ketchup and Oscar Mayer hot dogs failed to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission despite a deadline extension.The warning from S&P comes three weeks after the consumer products group revealed a $15bn writedown, a one-third cut to its dividend and an SEC investigation into its accounting.A downgrade would push Kraft Heinz’s debt just one notch away from junk territory and could raise the borrowing costs on the company’s long term debt, which stood at $30.8bn at the end of 2018.“If we lower our ratings, the downgrade would likely be limited to one notch, unless particularly negative information is uncovered,” said S&P in a statement.Kraft Heinz warned in February it would not file its 10-K until its own internal investigation into its accounting practices had concluded. In a regulatory filing on Monday, the group said it was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and it now has 60 calendar days to submit a plan to the exchange operator to regain compliance.Both Fitch and Moody’s currently have Kraft at the lowest investment grade rating.Shares in Kraft Heinz were 1.2 per cent lower on Monday and down more than 16 per cent since the disclosure of the SEC probe.
28;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-03-17T15:02:37Z;US retailers trump Warren Buffett with push into own brands;Kraft Heinz’s $15bn writedown highlights pressure on some well-known consumer labels;The balance of power is shifting between the biggest US retailers and their main suppliers.New industry data show retailers such as Walmart, Costco and Target are boosting sales of their own products almost four times faster than famous American brands, winning over consumers with high quality goods at low prices.Sales of so-called private label food and drink, toiletries and other consumer goods rose 4.3 per cent in US stores in the final three months of 2018, according to Nielsen. In contrast, sales of the 20 biggest brands eked out only a 1.2 per cent increase.The rising popularity of private label is shaking old certainties about the value of established brands. Kraft Heinz, the Warren Buffett-backed consumer staples group behind HP Sauce and Philadelphia Cream Cheese, took a $15bn writedown last month, reflecting gloomier prospects for some of its best known products.“You have to deliver something that is superior,” said Stefan Descheemaeker, chief executive of Nomad Foods, the company behind Birds Eye and Findus. “If you don’t, then at some stage the question arises: why do you need brands?”Executives at several of the biggest US retailers divulged more detail on how they were building up their own brands in products from milk to underwear as they presented earnings reports in recent weeks.Kroger said it had introduced 1,022 own brand items to its supermarket shelves in 2018. While the grocer’s overall results disappointed Wall Street, the performance of its own brands impressed: sales of its Simple Truth line of products, which range from lip balm to popcorn, rose 15 per cent in 2018.Rodney McMullen, chairman and chief executive, said the rationale for Kroger’s expansion was simple. “We make more profit than we do selling the national brands.”Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive of Target, said the big box retailer’s efforts to develop its own brands had been so aggressive that the team responsible had completed “three or four years of work in about 18 months”.The popularity of its house brands, which include Archer Farms food, Smartly staples and Opalhouse home decor, was a main reason why the chain was avoiding the gloom in the wider retail sector, he added. Target this month posted a 5 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for 2018, its biggest annual increase since 2005.“It’s certainly been a big part of our market share gains,” said Mr Cornell.Target’s expansion has been particularly ambitious, and the chief executive added that it was likely to slow in the months ahead.But the big worry for Kraft Heinz and rivals, such as Campbell Soup and General Mills, is that the wider retail industry is only getting started. “It’s going to keep getting bigger,” Mr Buffett said in a recent CNBC interview.So far, private label products in the US have won over fewer shoppers than they have in Europe, despite the recent rapid growth. In tissues, for instance, retailers’ brands have only a 27 per cent share in the US compared with 55 per cent on the other side of the Atlantic, according to Euromonitor International.“Part of it has to do with America being the heartland of capitalism,” said Bob Hoyler, research analyst at Euromonitor. “Going back generations, families had really strong preferences for particular brands.”That began to change after the financial meltdown of 2008, which created millions of newly frugal bargain hunters. Millennials who came of age during the great recession do not have the same attachment to big brands. Television and other mass media, meanwhile, have lost influence, undermining traditional marketing.Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, is among the companies investing in private label. Additions to its line-up in the past year include its Winemakers Selection of wines and Allswell, an upscale mattress and bedding brand.“Private label penetration has probably grown more than I thought it would in the US,” Brett Biggs, chief financial officer, said at a conference this month. Store brands, he noted, were more popular among younger Americans “than with my generation”.Among the most successful of the own-brands has been Costco’s Kirkland, whose products range from peanut butter to pet food. Mr Buffett said Kirkland, introduced in 1992, produced about $39bn in sales last year — more than all the brands combined at Kraft Heinz.The German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have transformed European retail, are another danger for the established American brands.Then there is Amazon, which Mr Buffett highlighted as the big threat.Amazon’s portfolio has grown from 86 house brands at the end of 2017 to 137, according to TJI Research. That includes items sold at Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought in 2017.The online retailer’s Amazon Basics label appears on everything from yoga mats to suitcases to motor oil. Mama Bear nappies, Rivet furniture and Wag pet food are among its scores of other brands.The increasing popularity of cheaper alternatives undermines the traditional consumer companies’ ability to raise prices — a particular problem when input costs rise. When rivals increase prices, said Mr McMullen of Kroger, “they end up giving up market share to our own brands”.Industry executives and analysts said producers of the big brands would need to make investments of their own to stop ceding further ground to retailers.“Give consumers a reason to care about your brand and your product,” said Greg Portell, a lead partner at the consultancy AT Kearney.Kraft Heinz has been introducing healthier food and drink and its own niche “craft” produce. 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that controls the company along with Mr Buffett, has sought to shake off a reputation for overly aggressive cost-cutting.While not commenting on 3G specifically, Mr Descheemaeker of Nomad said: “Being lean is fine, but the key question is what you are doing with the savings. Are you going to reinvest behind your brands or just put everything into bottom line?”“At the end of the day, it’s really up to the brands to make the difference.”
29;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-03-01T13:54:43Z;Warren Buffett: his senior moments;The best investors wait for the worst of times;Warren Buffett is a legendary stock investor. Maybe his accomplishments as a lender of last resort should be more celebrated. His reputation has taken a hit following poor results from Kraft Heinz, the US consumer foods company he controls with Brazilian investment firm, 3G Capital. Kraft Heinz’s shares are now off a staggering two-thirds from their 2017 peak. But consider how he got involved with 3G Capital and you will appreciate his fixed income genius.When 3G and Berkshire Hathaway bought Heinz at a transaction value of $28bn in 2013, each put in a little more than $4bn of common equity. But Mr Buffett also bought $8bn of preferred stock earning a juicy 9 per cent yield in a low-interest rate environment.Taking a senior position in the capital structure limited his exposure to a default. This left a near double-digit return with little risk. It was a brilliant move few others had the muscle to pull off.In 2015, when Heinz merged with Kraft, the new company immediately sold junk bonds so it could redeem the preferred stock and eliminate that expensive coupon payment to Berkshire. Mr Buffett’s common equity stake in Kraft Heinz is today worth roughly $11bn. He paid roughly $9bn for it, so he is still ahead.Judged by its annualised rate of return standard, that nine per cent preferred stock dividend was a much better investment. Mr Buffett also made fabulous profits on preferred stock rescue financings at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, General Electric. He put $13bn in total to work at institutions that were too big to fail.Such value investing opportunities have been limited in the last decade, as Mr Buffett has lamented. His cash hoard stands at $112bn. Berkshire Hathaway stock has produced an annualised return of 12 per cent in the decade since the financial crisis, one percentage point behind the S&P 500. Turbulence cannot come fast enough for Mr Buffett.
30;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-03-01T02:57:42Z;Kraft Heinz warns it will miss SEC filing deadline;Food group delays annual report amid procurement investigation;Kraft Heinz warned on Thursday it would miss a deadline to file its annual report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as it provided new details of the $15bn writedown that has shaken the consumer goods industry.The company behind Kraft dinners and Heinz tomato sauce said it would not file the report, known as a 10-K, by a “prescribed due date” while an internal investigation into its procurement was continuing.The latest disclosure comes a week after the food group revealed an annual loss, a one-third cut to its dividend and an SEC investigation into its accounting.The ensuing stock market sell-off knocked 27 per cent from its share price and dragged Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, a major shareholder, to one of its largest quarterly losses in history.Among the bad news, Kraft Heinz disclosed it had received a subpoena from the SEC in October over its accounting for procurement. The company, based in Chicago, had launched an internal investigation in response, aided by external counsel.On Thursday, after the stock market closed in New York, Kraft Heinz said it would not file its 10-K until the investigation had concluded. “We are working toward filing our 10-K in the next few weeks once we have finalised our investigation,” it said in a statement. “At this time the company does not expect matters subject to the investigation to be material.”The food company, engineered in a 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz by the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, also shed more light on the $15.4bn impairment charge it disclosed last week.The writedown reduced by about 17 per cent the value of $97bn worth of assets on its balance sheet, reflecting more downbeat prospects for the profitability of some of its best-known products.About $4.1bn of the writedown related to the Kraft brand, in part because of lower anticipated packaged cheese sales, and about $3.3bn was due mainly to weakened profit margins at its Oscar Mayer meat brand.About $7.1bn related to goodwill writedowns at operating businesses, including a $4.3bn charge from its refrigerated foods business in the US and a further $2bn from its Canada operations.Smaller charges related to businesses in Asia and Latin America, and to its Philadelphia and Velveeta cheese brands.There was no “single determinative event” that led to the charge, the company said, but the “totality of several factors” in the final three months of 2018.
31;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-28T16:50:33Z;US credit ratings: attack of the killer Bs;Companies kept in investment grade territory even when their raw numbers merit downgrades;No one receives the benefit of the doubt more plentifully than megacap companies with BBB credit ratings. This despite hammer blows to groups such as AB InBev, AT&T, General Electric, Kraft Heinz and Verizon. Shareholders have jumped ship and creditors have fretted in the face of technological disruption and M&A disasters. Rating agencies have kept the companies in investment grade territory even when their raw numbers merit downgrades.The lessons? First, never underestimate institutional inertia. Second, big established companies have more resources and market power to weather a downturn. Bosses and bond investors should be grateful. A downgrade of a few notches to junk status would be devastating for them.Not only would borrowing costs explode. Many investment funds would be stampeded into massive debt sales. They are prohibited from holding junk-rated paper. Savvy companies are exploiting the grace period granted to them to clean up their acts. Sadly for remaining shareholders, that means slashed dividends, M&A freezes and turning away from growth.Leverage and ratings do not have a smoothly linear relationship. Big companies have often raised their total debt to ebitda ratios above four times, a level approaching that of junk. In response, General Electric, Ab InBev, and Kraft Heinz have cut their dividends between a third and 95 per cent. That has sent stock prices plummeting. Last Friday, shares in foods group Kraft Heinz dropped by nearly a third, a loss of $14bn in equity value.These drastic actions provide reassurance to creditors that big companies will do just about anything to keep their investment grade ratings. Bank of America notes that credit spreads for Verizon and AT&T have tightened since mid-2018, even as they have widened in the broader market. Bond investors felt safe jumping in as they figured a BBB rating was a floor that the companies would not care to test.Sometimes CEOs will concede that working for shareholders means working for bondholders first.
32;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-27T10:00:23Z;Warren Buffett was too American to see through Kraft;The founder of Berkshire Hathaway put excess faith in US packaged food brands;Warren Buffett never bets against the US, the country where he built his fortune. “The record of American business has been extraordinary . . . We are lucky — gloriously lucky — to have that force at our back,” he wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday.He should have been less patriotic about Kraft, the processed food group that makes staples such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Velveeta, a bright yellow “processed cheese product”. The merger that he engineered between Heinz and Kraft in 2015 has turned out very badly: Heinz paid too much for an indigestible bunch of ageing brands in the wrong country.The $15.4bn impairment of Kraft Heinz assets that contributed to a plunge in its share price on Friday can be put down to various causes — cost-cutting by 3G, the private equity group that manages it, discounting by supermarkets, and changing tastes among millennials. But there is a simpler explanation: 98 per cent of Kraft’s sales before the merger were in North America.It would be anathema to Mr Buffett to admit it. Not only has he always been a staunch believer in US enterprise and “our country’s almost unbelievable prosperity”, but he embodies 20th-century consumerism. His habitual drink is Cherry Coke (Berkshire holds a 9.4 per cent stake in Coca-Cola) and he picks up breakfast each day at a McDonald’s in Omaha, Nebraska.Were he less parochial, he might have seen Kraft Heinz’s downfall coming. He noted on Monday how sales of the Kirkland Signature private label brand owned by Costco, the US discount warehouse club, had overtaken all of the Kraft Heinz brands put together. The old trick — advertising brands heavily and pushing them on to supermarket shelves — was failing.In other words, what he calls the “moat” around US packaged food brands has been crossed. As he wrote in his 2007 annual letter, he has always avoided investing in “companies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change” in favour of those with “superiorities . . . that make life difficult for their competitors”. These were either low-cost providers or companies with “a powerful worldwide brand”.The consumer moat was first crossed in Europe, where supermarkets have cultivated their own brands for longer, and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl have shown that consumers will avoid paying a premium for staples. Kirkland Signature’s annual sales of $39bn are old news in Europe, with private labels holding more than 40 per cent of the market in the UK and Germany.When Kraft’s snack brands such as Cadbury and Oreo were demerged into Mondelez International in 2012, Kraft was left with history. The theory was that Heinz could push Kraft’s brands overseas, but there is little hunger for American concoctions such as Cheez Whiz, nor thirst for Kool-Aid, the brand of flavoured soda powders invented in Mr Buffett’s home state in 1927.This was compounded by the cost-cutting zeal of 3G, Mr Buffett’s unlikely partner at Kraft Heinz. Mr Buffett this week defended its mantra of raising margins rather than investing in growth, saying that innovation and marketing were unaffected by zero-based budgeting. But there was collateral damage — 3G has admitted as much by putting $300m into innovation.Decades of pursuing convenience and reliability, rather than health and organic ingredients, leave Kraft Heinz with a credibility gap when it turns to wooing the new generation. Its announcement in January that “Kraft Natural Cheese is now made with milk from cows raised without the artificial growth hormone rbST” invites the question of what “natural” meant before.Neither as eater nor investor has Mr Buffett much appetite for millennial brands. “If you think about it, people do not change their habits that much . . . There are very few billion-dollar brands that have been created in food,” he told CNBC. He prefers the old ones, citing their bargaining power over the grocery store founded by his great-grandfather in 1869.But every brand starts small — Ben & Jerry’s ice cream was founded in 1978 before outgrowing its craft roots and being acquired by Unilever in 2000. The most troubling development for Mr Buffett is that retailers have adapted to consumers better than Kraft Heinz. The Simple Truth organic brand created by the US supermarket chain Kroger passed $2bn in annual sales in 2017.This has daunting implications for his attachment to US food and drink brands. Low cost retailers such as Costco and Walmart still have moats similar to the one around Geico, Berkshire Hathaway’s retail insurer. They can sell their own staples, competing with Kraft Heinz and others, and cutting the price premium they enjoyed.It also shows that his fondness for the US reached a limit with the Kraft Heinz deal. The notion that Kraft’s quaint products could be given the 3G treatment yet manage to grow relied on the country remaining a retail world unto itself. It turns out to have more in common with Europe than he realised: advertising flavoured with history is no longer enough.john.gapper@ft.com

Now back to the show . . .You might think that Warren Buffett’s biggest problem is related to the disastrous performance of Kraft Heinz (or his sugary intake at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting where he is known to gulp down a few Cokes).Days after his sprawling conglomerate took a multibillion-dollar writedown on its stake in the struggling US foods group, the US billionaire had to admit that he was “wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz”. One way he was wrong: overpaying for Kraft’s merger with Heinz in 2015.Yet that isn’t what’s keeping him up at night (in fact he still believes Kraft Heinz is a great business and trusts his 3G Capital partners to fix things at some point — watch his interview on CNBC on this point).

The big problem for the doyen of the investing world is that his investment firm has $112bn to spend and he doesn’t know where to put it to use.DD’s Eric Platt, who spent his weekend combing through Berkshire’s 10-K and Buffett’s annual letter, writes that the Oracle of Omaha is nervous that he won’t clinch a mega-deal in 2019. He’s done several in his lifetime, including the $37bn purchase of Precision Castparts in 2016 and the 2010 deal for railroad BNSF that valued the company at $44bn.“Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects,” he wrote to shareholders in his wide-ranging annual letter. “2019 will probably see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition.”If you need a refresher on how prolific of a dealmaker Buffett is, check out the graphic below.Obviously, some would argue that Buffett should consider taking Kraft Heinz private. After all, the maker of Velveeta cheese and Jello is cheaper than it has been.Another option would be to buy a retailer. Costco has a market cap of about $96bn, which is not out of reach for a guy like Buffett (so long as he has a co-investor or two . . .).Who knows if Buffett would want to invest in a retailer today, even one that is as profitable as Costco. But for the man who has long heralded his investments in brands, Buffett is sounding increasingly sour on the traditional makers of consumer goods. He told CNBC on Monday that he’d “misjudged the retail versus brand fight”, referring to how retailers have pushed their own private label brands at the expense of legacy brands produced by the likes of Kraft Heinz.“With Amazon and Walmart fighting it’s a bit like the elephants fighting,” he quipped. “The mice get trampled.”Lex suggests that Buffett might resort to doing what he hates most: returning cash back to his investors. That’s certainly a possibility. But it seems too unlike Buffett for it to happen.If you have any good suggestions for Buffett’s next big deal, email Eric — that’s what he’ll spend his next weekend working on. ;-)When you think about fast-talking South Africans who love doing aggressive mining deals, most would think of Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg.That reputation is at risk, however, of being one-upped by Mark Bristow, the big game hunting gold miner.(That’s Bristow above. He has defended criticism of his frequent big game hunting as a vital means to raise funds for conservation in Africa. Errr . . . )Bristow has been in full dealmaking mode. Last month, he closed a $6bn acquisition of Randgold Resources, which Bristow founded, by its larger rival Barrick Gold of Canada. The deal saw Bristow become the chief executive of the combined Barrick, while former Goldman Sachs banker John Thornton was named executive chairman.He wasn’t done there. On Monday, Bristow and Thornton launched a hostile $18bn all-share, nil-premium offer to acquire US-based Newmont Mining. If successful, the deal would create the world’s largest gold producer by output.There are several obstacles to a deal. For one, the history between Barrick and Newmont is littered with failed attempts to combine. The most serious effort was in 2014 where merger talks collapsed at the final hurdle and prompted mutual recriminations.There’s also the fact that Newmont is in the process of trying to complete a $10bn takeover of Goldcorp, another gold miner, which Barrick accuses of being a second-tier asset. (It even called the deal “desperate and bizarre”.)And there’s the fact that the (aptly!) named Newmont boss Gary Goldberg seems to hate the concept of a deal with Barrick. Defending his deal for Goldcorp, Goldberg accused Barrick of have an “ineffective operating mode” and a “poor track record” on delivering shareholder returns. Youch!Given the hostilities and the history, both companies are skipping the pleasantries and making their cases directly to Newmont shareholders.The holy grail for a combination between Barrick and Newmont is a Nevada mine where the companies overlap and opportunity for cost savings is immense. Barrick also plans to get rid of Newmont’s head office and shred most of its management for some extra savings.Why nil-premium hostile? Barrick believes shareholders in the industry are all roughly the same funds and they have shareholding in all the major companies. Why pay a premium when investors could pocket the savings? Barrick argues Newmont would own 44 per cent of the combined group with the share offer and gives it plenty of upside.Newmont has been one of the best-performing gold miners over the past decade and is the only gold miner in the S&P 500. “Where would you put your retirement money? Who would you want to invest in? We have a proven record of running a global mining company,” says Goldberg.DD takeaway: This is going to get much uglier. Lex says the combination makes sense and that Newmont deserves a premium.General Electric’s new chief executive Larry Culp took his biggest step in breaking up the storied conglomerate on Monday. Interestingly, the $21.4bn sale of GE’s biotech business to Danaher almost didn’t happen.Before Culp took the top post at GE five months ago, Danaher had approached GE leadership about buying some of its healthcare assets. It was rebuffed, a source tells DD. But after John Flannery was ousted at the end of September, Danaher thought it was time to retry its luck.On Monday the two groups announced the deal, which includes $21bn of badly needed cash for GE. Culp tells the FT’s Ed Crooks and DD’s Eric Platt that the high price tag GE secured for the unit would let the company exert some patience when selling off other businesses.“The dynamic changes a little bit,” he said. “Formerly, it looked as if we were a little bit desperate. Today, it’s that we’re on a much better footing.”Culp also indicated that an initial public offering of GE’s remaining healthcare businesses wouldn’t happen this year and might be abandoned altogether.“We have no less urgency today, but we do have a little bit more flexibility,” Culp said. “And the dynamics change in favour of the GE shareholder.”Shares of both companies rallied on the news. But Danaher may have come out ahead. Its stock jumped 8.4 per cent, ahead of the 6.4 per cent gain in GE.Indra Nooyi, the former PepsiCo chief executive, has joined Amazon’s board of directors.

34;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

36;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-25T12:34:33Z;Warren Buffett admits overpaying for Kraft;Comments follow Berkshire Hathaway’s multibillion-dollar writedown on Kraft Heinz;Warren Buffett has for the first time said that Berkshire Hathaway overpaid for Kraft’s merger with Heinz, in a rare admission of failure by the investor with the midas touch.The acknowledgment came days after his investment group took a multibillion-dollar writedown on its stake in the struggling US consumer goods group.“We overpaid for Kraft,” Mr Buffett said in an interview on CNBC, adding that he was “wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz”. Mr Buffett and Brazilian investment fund 3G Capital bought Kraft in 2015 to merge with Heinz in a deal valuing Kraft at $62.6bn. When the combined company floated on the stock market at the time it was worth $89bn — on Monday it was worth $41.6bn.“Anything, almost anything at a price can be good, not everything,” said the so-called Oracle of Omaha. “But everything at a certain price can be bad. If you pay too much, you pay too much and that doesn’t change.”Kraft Heinz shares dived nearly 30 per cent on Friday after it took a $15bn writedown, cut its dividend payout and disclosed it was the subject of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting policies.Berkshire, which owns a 26.7 per cent stake in Kraft Heinz, on Saturday took a $3bn impairment charge on its investment — as part of one of Berkshire’s largest quarterly losses in history.On Monday Mr Buffett said Jorge Paulo Lemann, 3G’s co-founder, was an “absolute outstanding human being”, but he dodged questions on whether Berkshire would make other deals with his group.His acknowledgment of the failings of the Kraft deal contrast sharply with the glowing praise he has previously showered on Kraft Heinz and his 3G partners managing the group. “This is my kind of transaction, uniting two world-class organisations and delivering shareholder value,” the billionaire investor said at the time of the merger.Mr Buffett has in the past referred to Mr Lemann, a former professional tennis player, as among the world’s most effective businessmen. Known for rolling up troubled consumer companies, then aggressively cutting costs in an effort to bolster profits, 3G was viewed by Mr Buffett as a master operator. “They hold themselves to extraordinarily high performance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors,” Mr Buffett wrote in a letter to investors back in 2014.However, his relationship with his Brazilian partners has splintered since Kraft Heinz made a failed hostile bid to acquire Unilever for $143bn in 2017. Mr Buffett has long opposed hostile transactions.Since the attempted Unilever takeover collapsed, Kraft Heinz’s stock has fallen sharply. That is in part the result of the company’s struggle adapting to changing consumer tastes, which Mr Buffett acknowledged on Monday.“We both misjudged the retail versus brand fight as to who would be gaining ground on the other,” he said, referring to retailers that have pushed their own private label brands over established labels owned by the likes of Kraft Heinz. “With Amazon and Walmart fighting it’s a bit like the elephants fighting. The mice get trampled.”3G has stressed that it is now focused on investing in the business and is confident the worst is behind it. But analysts on Wall Street questioned whether the group had finally turned a corner.“We believe Kraft’s business is facing more challenges than management has let on,” said Brittany Weissman of Edward Jones. “3G Capital does not have a track record of growing both sales and profit margins without making an acquisition, which is our concern.”
37;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-25T06:11:24Z;Top consumer companies ill-prepared for climate risks, says study;Packaged goods groups left exposed by lack of structural change, report finds;Many of the world’s biggest consumer goods groups are ill-prepared for the severe disruption to their businesses posed by climate change and global water shortages, according to a new study.While companies have launched or revamped products to appeal to increasingly climate-conscious consumers, very few have made structural changes to prepare themselves for the impact that water scarcity, heat damage and increasingly stringent government regulations will have on business performance, according to CDP.The non-profit environment and investment research provider examined the world’s largest 16 consumer goods companies to assess their response to the threat of climate change. Its findings are to be published on Monday.Its report found that Kraft Heinz was the least prepared of the companies. Exposed to high emissions, land-use and water-shortage risks from its meat and dairy products, the US group is in a vulnerable position, yet is a laggard in terms of commitment to energy sustainability, using no renewable sources, according to CDP.Changes in consumer demands and a growing awareness of business risks have sparked strategic shifts at a handful of companies, however, including Unilever and L’Oréal.“Leading companies are taking action across their entire value chain and redefining the role of business in society — by engaging with suppliers, innovating their product lines and even working with consumers to drive behaviour change,” said Carole Ferguson, head of investor research at CDP.“These efforts need to be replicated by others in the sector if they are to justify their role in a society that can no longer be based on fast-paced, rising consumption and linear business models,” she added.Unilever and L’Oréal have produced a broad range of vegan and organic alternatives and reduced packaging across their portfolios, but CDP found that other groups including Kraft Heinz, beauty group Estée Lauder and Dutch brewer Heineken have made very few such changes.Michael Mullen, senior vice-president of corporate and government affairs at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement: “We know driving meaningful environmental change is an industry-wide effort and Kraft Heinz is serious about doing its part.“We’re identifying projects in areas like logistics, packaging and agriculture to further reduce our impact. We look forward to announcing those targets and sharing additional detail in 2020.”L’Oréal offers suppliers tools to promote sustainable agricultural practices and has replaced virgin materials with 7,294 tonnes of recycled materials. Renewables now account for 51 per cent of energy consumed globally by the company, and 100 per cent of electricity consumed in the US, the report finds.It also reuses industrial water at every possible opportunity, treating wastewater using a number of technologies. Heineken, whose products contain some of the highest quantities of water of the 16 companies examined, faces serious risks from supply shortages for which it is not prepared for, said CDP. “Water-related issues are not integrated into any of the company’s long-term strategic plans,” it said.CDP found that the poorest performer in personal care was Estée Lauder. While the company has launched some pilot schemes to replace virgin plastic with recycled content and improve water efficiency, they were only “incremental in impact” said the report.Meanwhile, only 5 per cent of palm oil used in its products comes from certified sources.Responding to the report, Estée Lauder said: “We are committed to accelerating our sustainability and citizenship practices across the company and our brands. We plan on continuously updating our targets and transparently communicating our progress.”Environmental analysts predict further market disruption and warn that if companies do not prepare for them now, they will soon be outstripped by competitors.“Ongoing activism around plastics and packaging is just the tip of the iceberg, and we expect to see more environmental issues come to the fore as consumers start to question what goes into the products they buy, use and dispose of,” said Ms Ferguson.
38;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-22T19:07:06Z;Kraft Heinz shares dive 27% after SEC opens probe;$16bn wiped from company’s market value after ‘disastrous’ update;Shares in Kraft Heinz dived 27 per cent on Friday as Wall Street reacted with alarm to a “disastrous” update in which the company took a $15bn writedown and disclosed it was the subject of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting policies in procurement.About $16bn was wiped from the market value of the company behind Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Kraft dinners and Oscar Mayer hot dogs after it disclosed the bad news.The writedown, combined with the SEC subpoena, intensified concerns about the management style of 3G Capital, which engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz and went on to pursue deep cost cuts.Only two years ago the enlarged group had hoped to buy Europe’s Unilever but the planned $143bn deal collapsed amid concerns about a culture clash.The SEC probe prompted the company to launch its own investigation and, as a result, it recorded a $25m increase to its “costs of products sold”.“They didn’t really go into a lot of detail but it doesn’t seem to move the needle — it just looks bad,” said John Baumgartner, analyst at Wells Fargo.Kraft Heinz said it was co-operating “fully” with the SEC, was improving its internal controls and did not expect the matters subject to the investigation to be “material” to its financial results.Kraft Heinz took the impairment charge to reflect the more downbeat prospects for the profitability of some of its best-known products.Shares fell to their lowest level since the group was created and triggered a rout across the wider sector with investors questioning how custodians of other big brands were coping as consumers shunned packaged foods.By early afternoon in New York, Campbell Soup was down 8.3 per cent, General Mills 3.4 per cent and Kellogg 3.3 per cent.Kraft Heinz’s travails reverberated in Europe, knocking as much as 4 per cent from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, which was also built by 3G.Although the two circumstances are not exactly the same, ABI is also struggling to show that it can stoke sales growth after years of relentless focus on expenses and margins.The [SEC] didn’t really go into a lot of detail but it doesn’t seem to move the needle — it just looks badThe troubles at Kraft Heinz and ABI were “calling the whole model into question”, said James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC. “Kraft Heinz is to food what Budweiser is to beer: brands that are not very hip or current, and struggling to be relevant.”Kraft Heinz’s writedown reflected a reduced value of goodwill at its US refrigerated and Canada retail businesses and its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands.“The trademarks have a value based on assumptions of future cash flows — but now they are saying their future earnings power is not what they initially expected it to be, so they need to write down the value,” said Mr Baumgartner.Bond markets also reacted with concern. Kraft Heinz bonds due to mature in 2045 dipped 1.24 cents on the dollar to 83.67 cents, just over 2 cents shy of an all-time low.The developments had “the hallmarks of a company that has a serious balance sheet problem”, said Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, who described the update as “disastrous”.Kraft Heinz slashed its dividend more than a third and said it was eyeing divestitures in an effort to shore up its balance sheet.Wall Street raised eyebrows over remarks from Bernardo Hees, chief executive, who signalled that despite the setbacks the company still had its eye on dealmaking.The dividend cut and disposals would give Kraft Heinz “the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation — for us to be a consolidator — if the industry goes that way”, he said.Steven Strycula, at UBS, said: “We do not believe a large-scale deal is in KHC investors’ best interest. Margin gains have proven unsustainable and [earnings] erosion makes debt deleverage challenging.”Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, 3G’s highest-profile backer, was caught up in the sell-off. Shares in Berkshire, Kraft Heinz’s biggest shareholder, were down 1.7 per cent.Additional reporting by Joe Rennison and Arash Massoudi
39;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-22T09:00:55Z;Kraft Heinz: playing ketchup;Private equity in the public markets looks like a flop;The new hipster flavour offered by Kraft Heinz: humiliation. Late on Thursday, the packaged food Frankenstein unveiled a grab-bag of horrors. These included an SEC accounting investigation, a $15bn impairment, a 10 per cent earnings drop and a one-third dividend cut. This was the moment zero-based budgeting added up to a lot less than zero.Shares in the consumer conglomerate crashed by almost a third. Kraft Heinz was assembled by Warren Buffett and private equity masterminds 3G Capital. Backing from the smartest guys in the room has given the business no protection from turmoil in the foods sector.The central thesis of 3G, a Brazilian-American investment group, has been that the consumer sector is flabby. That means companies can carry far more debt while cutting costs steeply. The problem is that it is a trick you can only pull off once.Kraft Heinz has meanwhile struggled in the métiers that matter most in food: innovation and marketing. It has failed to satisfy the taste of consumers for healthier meals. The $15bn impairment reflected the diminished prospects of such core brands as Oscar Meyer meats and Kraft cheese.The business now carries $30bn in net debt, equivalent to a bulging five times ebida, a cash earnings measure. This is well above the three times forecast at the time of the 2015 merger and inconsistent with the current investment grade credit rating.Despite the flood of dreadful news, Kraft Heinz remained as bouncy in its fourth quarter statement as its rubberised cheese. Organic sales growth has turned slightly positive, the group said, while tossing around terms such as “growth pillars” and “whitespace”.3G ruthlessly emphasises hard numbers rather than buzzwords. These will not improve at Kraft Heinz. The company forecasts ebitda will fall by nearly a fifth in the first quarter of 2019. A management team whose expertise is in slash-and-burn budgeting now needs to change tack and pull off an organic recovery. A $16bn loss in equity value betrays how little confidence investors have of this happening.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

41;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-22T02:10:05Z;SEC opens investigation into Kraft Heinz accounting;Shares drop in after-hours trading as company discloses subpoena;Kraft Heinz has received an accounting subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and announced an impairment charge and dividend cut, sending shares in the food company falling in after-hours trading.The subpoena, which the company said it had received in October, related to its “accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls” in procurement.Kraft Heinz said it had subsequently launched its own investigation and increased the costs of its products sold by $25m as a result. “The company is in the process of implementing certain improvements to its internal controls to mitigate the likelihood of this occurring in the future and has taken other remedial measures,” it said, adding it was co-operating “fully” with the SEC.“The company does not expect the matters subject to the investigation to be material to its current period or any prior period financial statements,” it added.The disclosure came as the company said it would cut its dividend by more than a third and took a $15.4bn impairment charge, pushing the food group to a loss of $12.6bn for the fourth quarter.Kraft Heinz, whose brands range from HP Sauce to Oscar Mayer hot dogs, also said it was reducing its quarterly dividend to $0.40 a share, or $1.60 a year — down from $2.50 a year.The news sent shares in the Chicago-based group down by more than 20 per cent in after-hours trading to just above $38.The results are the latest setback for Kraft Heinz, which has been battling rapidly changing consumer tastes, upheaval in advertising markets and shifts in distribution. Even before the latest sell-off, the shares had fallen about one-third since the 2015 tie-up.David Knopf, chief financial officer, said Kraft Heinz, whose long-term debt burden totalled $30.9bn at the end of 2018, was eyeing divestitures of assets with “no clear path to competitive advantage”.The company recorded the non-cash charge as it reduced the value of goodwill at its US refrigerated and Canada retail businesses and its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands.Mr Knopf said the writedown primarily reflected lowered “margin expectations” due to Kraft Heinz’s performance in the second half of last year, driven by “supply chain issues”. He also referred to a higher “discount rate”, meaning steep interest rates had reduced the present value of future cash flows.Kenneth Goldman, analyst at JPMorgan, challenged executives about their explanation for the poor results. “Companies generally don’t take writedowns because recent performance was bad and because discount rates have risen,” he said, asking whether the problem was “broader and longer term”.He added that there had been “consistent financial disappointments at Kraft”.The company was formed by a 2015 megamerger of Kraft and Heinz engineered by the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital and backed by Warren Buffett. But the writedown highlighted investor concerns that the ruthless cost-cutting for which 3G is renowned had hurt the business.“If they [investors] ask . . . if the 3G belt-tightening strategy goes too far and it damages brands . . . isn’t at least some evidence starting to point to ‘yes’ there?” asked Mr Goldman.Bernardo Hees, chief executive, said: “We still believe strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future.”He added that management was “disappointed” by profitability levels. “We were overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialise,” he said.The net loss compared with net income of almost $8bn last time. Net sales in the three months to the end of December were little changed from a year ago, at $6.89bn.Despite the setbacks, he signalled the company still had its eye on future dealmaking.The dividend cut and divestitures would give Kraft Heinz “the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation — for us to be a consolidator — if the industry goes that way”.

43;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Kraft Heinz boss sees valuations attractive for M&A;Food company and its backer 3G Capital have refrained from big deals for past two years;The chief executive of Kraft Heinz, Bernardo Hees, says that valuations among its peers have become “more attractive” since its $143bn swoop for Unilever collapsed two years ago, an indication that the acquisitive owners of the food company could soon return to dealmaking.The company, backed by Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, has avoided large acquisitions since the Unilever deal fell through and instead completed only a few far smaller bolt-ons.But the Chicago-based company, whose brands range from HP Sauce to Oscar Mayer hot dogs, is under pressure from investors to eke out more growth in its mature markets and Wall Street has long debated how long it will be before its next big transaction.“I can say that valuations today are much more attractive than before,” said Mr Hees in an interview with the Financial Times. “The value equation of this conversation is . . . attractive.”Results due on Thursday are forecast to show the company produced sales of $26.3bn last year, little changed from the year before. Net debt stood at about $31bn as of the end of September, a heavy burden that makes a transformative deal more complicated.“Sometimes it’s going to work and sometimes it’s not,” Mr Hees said. “When you find something where two plus two is more than four, move. When you don’t, it’s better not to move especially because our growth agenda is clear.”Kraft Heinz’s management has emphasised investing in the business, particularly on the digital and marketing front, as it seeks to pursue organic as well as inorganic strategies to grow.The chief executive added the company was eyeing further expansion globally without doing deals. “There is potential for growth in a big way” for Kraft Heinz in Mexico and Turkey, along with several countries in Africa and eastern Europe, he said.Mergers and acquisitions for 3G Capital need not involve Kraft Heinz, however. The investment firm, which also owns US fast food group Burger King through its Restaurant Brands International business, has about $10bn locked away in a fund that went untouched because the Unilever bid fell through.Options for its deployment include buying an entirely new asset to begin consolidating companies in a different industry.Kraft Heinz was created by 3G Capital in a Warren Buffett-backed 2015 megamerger of Kraft and Heinz.The shares have fallen about one-third since the tie-up, underperforming the MSCI World consumer staples index and scything $30bn from its market capitalisation, leaving it at $59bn.Investors have become more bearish on the outlook for traditional food companies in the face of rapidly changing consumer tastes, upheaval in advertising markets and shifts in distribution.The companies in the MSCI World consumer staples index were trading at an average 22.9 times annual earnings two years ago, but this has fallen to 19.7 times, according to Bloomberg data. The 120-member index includes Nestlé, Diageo and Coca-Cola.
44;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Kraft Heinz is hungry for growth but can it do it organically?;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One thing to start: Aurelius Capital Management couldn’t help but revel in its spectacular win against Windstream Holdings in court on Monday. The distressed debt hedge fund gloated in a press release over its latest conquest by quoting Windstream’s previous claims that Aurelius was destined to lose and sarcastically wished rivals good luck with their now potentially worthless bonds. Now back to the show . . .In the past decade Brazilian-run 3G Capital and its co-investor Warren Buffett have won over the market on how to run a giant consumer goods company. The playbook? Borrow big to acquire underperforming/mature assets and slash costs.Now, almost exactly two years after Kraft Heinz failed to acquire Unilever for $143bn, some investors fear 3G’s famed model might be going out of fashion.Kraft Heinz’s share price has dropped by a third since the two iconic consumer brands merged in 2015. In the same timeframe, the MSCI World Consumer Staples index has rallied 11 per cent.Top executives at Kraft Heinz sat down with the FT’s Alistair Gray and DD’s James Fontanella-Khan in a series of interviews to explain why their model was never just about cutting costs. They stress how a first phase of cost-cutting is always followed by investment.This “phase two” is starting now, according to Kraft Heinz’s bosses, who’re trying to reposition the brands for the future, harnessing product innovation, ecommerce and data-driven marketing. That’s not an easy job given that processed food is falling out of favour with more health conscious consumers.Berkshire Hathaway boss Buffett once described 3G’s co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, a former professional tennis player, as among the world’s most effective businessmen. Meanwhile, 3G critic Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at Berkeley School of Law, said that their model was too “focused on cutting costs to the exclusion of other aspects of the business”.Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz and a 3G veteran, said the idea that “they cut too much” is wrong. “I’m actually growing where I believe there is value and decreasing where I believe there is not. We started accelerating our growth agenda,” he said. “We decided to invest more.” Hees, pictured below, also points to the $300m Kraft Heinz said last year it would invest in the business as evidence that they’re not all about cost cutting.Some on Wall Street sense this is a new strategy that departs from the past. “The model has really done a complete 180,” said John Baumgartner, analyst at Wells Fargo.Depending on how you see things, 3G will have to show that it can deliver the returns that once made it the darling of Wall Street. The current performance is just not good enough.Many think that the only way out of this will be through another deal. But for the time being there’s little evidence that they’re planning to strike again.An imposing tower on the edge of Tokyo’s main entertainment district offers passers-by little hint of what goes on inside. Few would be aware that behind those walls, a Japanese agricultural bank has transformed itself into the Godzilla of the collateralised loan obligation market.Robert Smith and Leo Lewis’s deep dive into the wild world of Japan’s Norinchukin Bank is essential reading for anyone trying to understand the capital flows powering the leveraged loan boom, which has underpinned so much recent dealmaking.The bank commonly known as Nochu, which for nearly 100 years has managed the savings of farmers and fisherman from Hokkaido to Okinawa, has also become the world’s most important and powerful investor in complex securities backed by risky loans.If DD readers are asking why a Japanese bank is piling into structured products put together on the other side of the world, let’s just say they’re not exactly new to this.In the run-up to the financial crisis, Nochu built up a large collection of collateralised debt obligations, and even substantial holdings of the “CDO squared” product made infamous by Michael Lewis’s The Big Short.We all remember what happened next . . .Mergers are sweeping across the Chinese property market but much of the action is happening in secretive dealings between asset managers and trust companies, not between real estate developers.Paladin Asset Management is one of the investors helping to drive the boom in M&A.Starting two years ago, the Shenzhen-based company, an investment group affiliated with Country Garden, China’s largest developer by sales, began identifying small developers struggling to pay back loans backed by their own real estate projects. Small developers have historically struggled to access standard bank loans. Therefore, many of these distressed loans are from shadow bankers, such as trust companies, rather than banks.Since then, Paladin has made a business of buying up that debt and, in effect, taking over real estate projects and often small developers. The company tries to revive the projects then sells them on to Country Garden or another large developer.“When we buy up the distressed debt of [a] small developer, we’re often taking over an entire small developer,” said Khoon Ng, chief executive of Paladin, which recently launched a $1bn fund with the Gaw family’s Gaw Capital. “This is something that is pushing consolidation much faster.”Read the latest from the FT here on distressed debt in China’s property market.China’s real estate market is highly fragmented, with more than 90,000 small developers operating in cities around the country, by Ng’s count. But that number is set to collapse as more of this style of property investing picks up.In December, US private equity group Warburg Pincus said it would spend up to $5bn on distressed property debt in a partnership with Beijing-based conglomerate Hande Group, which has a large property development business.China Vanke, another big developer, has teamed up with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to launch a fund focused on distressed property debt.Ken Hitchner is set to retire as Goldman Sachs’ Asia-Pacific chairman and chief executive later this year after 27 years with the bank. Hitchner has overseen the region, excluding Japan, since 2017.Air France-KLM has reappointed Pieter Elbers as chief executive of its Dutch subsidiary. Elbers has been the head of KLM since 2014.White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters is leaving the Trump administration in April to join Edelman Public Relations.Citadel has hired Samantha Greenberg as a portfolio manager focusing on technology, media and telecom investments. Greenberg was running her own hedge fund, Margate Capital, which she founded in 2016.Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer has appointed Charles Hayes as joint leader of the firm’s global financial investors group, alongside Markus Paul. Hayes will start his role in May and Paul will be succeeded by Arend von Riegen in December.Baker McKenzie has hired Randall Sunberg and Denis Segota as partners in its healthcare industry group and its North America corporate and securities practice in New York. Sunberg and Segota previously worked at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.Law firm Pillsbury has hired Jarrod D Murphy as a partner and Ted Powers III as a special counsel in its New York office. Murphy previously worked at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher while Powers was at Willkie Farr & Gallagher.Risky business Michael Calvey was one of the last remaining American investors in Russia.

45;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2019-02-19T04:48:53Z;Kraft Heinz: hungry for growth after austerity diet;With revenues flat and shares falling, the food group is cooking up fresh plans;"Pornography is an unconventional subject for a family food company. But during commercial breaks from the Super Bowl earlier this month, Kraft Heinz used the idea of “food porn” to promote frozen meals to American football fans.Without ever mentioning the P word during the primetime broadcast, the advertisements for its Devour brand played on the theme of a young man becoming hooked after ogling online images of “steamy” mac and cheese.“This addiction can happen to anyone,” his girlfriend warns. The company went a lot further online: it even took out ads on an actual porn website.The Devour campaign is the latest sign from Kraft Heinz and its Brazilian investment backers, 3G Capital, that they are prepared to take risks to win back shoppers who have ditched the mass-produced foods that were household staples for generations. In the process, the company is trying to change the view of what has been one of the most influential and controversial business models of recent decades.3G, whose brands range from Budweiser to Burger King, is known less for its marketing prowess and more for an intense focus on costs that has served as a model for corporate America in how to make money in mature markets.Yet almost four years since 3G engineered the $63bn megamerger of Kraft and Heinz, the company’s financial performance has stuttered, with the shares down around one-third since the 2015 tie-up. Wall Street has been left wondering if the lean-and-mean approach it once applauded has gone too far and starved the brands of much-needed investment.“They were focused on cutting costs to the exclusion of other aspects of the business,” says Steven Davidoff Solomon, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling who is now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. “Companies today are run pretty efficiently, as compared to the 1980s. You can’t cost-cut your way to a new product.”Now, in a series of interviews with the Financial Times, Kraft Heinz executives describe how they are trying to reposition the brands for the future, harnessing product innovation, ecommerce and data-driven marketing.“This concept that ‘they cut too much’: I’m actually growing where I believe there is value and decreasing where I believe there is not,” says Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz, at the company’s Chicago headquarters. “We started accelerating our growth agenda,” he says. “We decided to invest more.”Warren Buffett once described 3G’s co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, a former professional tennis player, as among the world’s most effective businessmen.In a series of debt-fuelled deals orchestrated with his partners Marcel Telles and Carlos “Beto” Sicupira, the billionaire took control of some of the world’s biggest consumer brands and squeezed higher profits out of them. At the heart of its philosophy is a capacity to nurture companies for decades, much longer than typical private equity firms.Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and grand slam champion Roger Federer, as well as Berkshire Hathaway’s Mr Buffett, were among a host of wealthy luminaries attracted by the handsome returns 3G’s strategy produced at its portfolio of companies.But when Mr Lemann said last year that a rapidly changing market for consumer goods made him feel like a “dinosaur”, investors feared he may be right.“I’ve been living in this cozy world of old brands, big volumes and nothing changing very much. You could just focus on being very efficient and you can do OK,” Mr Lemann said. “All of a sudden we are being disrupted.”The combination of Kraft, whose portfolio includes Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Kool-Aid, with Heinz, another consumer staples stalwart that the Brazilians had bought two years earlier, promised to transform the food industry. 3G, whose partners had previously rolled up some of the world’s biggest breweries into AB InBev, planned to do with baked beans, jelly and ketchup what had already been done with beer.The new owners quickly implemented their “zero-based budgeting” regime, which forces managers to justify every item of spending, no matter how small, every year. As part of the integration they closed six factories and cut 4,900 jobs.Rivals from Kellogg to General Mills sought to emulate 3G’s frugality, which according to Chris Growe, managing director at the brokerage Stifel, pushed Kraft Heinz’s already-low overheads from 11.5 per cent of sales in 2015 to just 8 per cent in 2017. The ratio at other large US food companies averaged 14 per cent.“We’ve never really seen a company do that before, especially one as big as Kraft Heinz,” says John Baumgartner, analyst at Wells Fargo, of its margin improvement. But he adds: “They’ve been so focused on cutting costs they really hadn’t put a lot into top line.”Results due on Thursday are forecast to show the group generated sales of $26.3bn in 2018, little changed from the year before and about 4 per cent lower than 2015.More consumers are shunning packaged foods in favour of fresh, natural and local alternatives. Avocado, kale and quinoa are in; processed cheese is out. Disrupters include Halo Top Creamery, which has upended the ice-cream business with its low-sugar and low-fat products, and Chicago’s RXBar, a protein bar maker which Kellogg bought for $600m just five years after it was founded.Kraft Heinz executives say there has always been more to 3G’s philosophy than cost-cutting. While the budget-trimming comes after the takeover, they say, there is an overlooked second phase that focuses more on investment and expansion.Supporters say evidence that they are prepared to invest is apparent at Restaurant Brands International, the vehicle 3G set up to bring under one roof the fast-food chains Burger King and Popeye’s and Canadian coffee shop chain Tim Hortons.“There is absolutely nothing in the model that prevents anything from growing or not growing,” says Mr Hees, who was chief executive of Burger King before he took charge of Heinz when 3G and Berkshire acquired it in 2013 for $23bn. “If you think you need to travel more because you’re going to have better results, then that’s easy; go travel.”Despite its reputation for austerity, the enlarged company has shown willingness to spend big. Within months of the tie-up, the enlarged Kraft Heinz group relocated from suburban Chicago to a glistening downtown high rise that overlooks Lake Michigan. Ad slots at the Super Bowl, during which the group also promoted Planters snacks, cost an estimated $10m.Echoing other consumer goods companies that are struggling for growth in mature markets, Kraft Heinz last year set out plans to invest $300m in the business. While 3G executives argue the shift in favour of investment has always been part of the plan, some on Wall Street sense a clear change in its approach. “The model has really done a complete 180,” says Mr Baumgartner.Kraft Heinz is deploying some of the funds to come up with new products. Recent additions to supermarket shelves include: Just Crack an Egg, a microwaveable cup of diced ingredients to which consumers do as the title instructs; O, That’s Good!, frozen pizzas launched last year with Oprah Winfrey; and MAX, an attempt to drag the 127-year-old coffee brand Maxwell House into the 21st century. The iced coffee is promoted in advertising by a young woman playing the drums.Conscious of rising demand for healthier foods, Kraft has also been “reformulating” hundreds of products. The updated recipes reduce fat and remove preservatives. It spent $10m doing so for its Oscar Mayer hot dogs.Yet there are clear limits to the health kick. The group is showing no sign of abandoning the kind of high margin products that served it so well for so long. Instead, it is trying to make them more relevant to today’s consumers.Internally, Kraft Heinz views “healthy” cuisine as just one of several consumer “need states”. Others include “craft”, or foods that give an impression of locality, and “ethnic”, given western consumers’ rising appetite for exotic products such as Ssäm, a Korean-style sauce rolled out in partnership with David Chang, founder of innovative Asian restaurant chain Momofuku.“The best way to think about it is about the occasions that people consume food,” says Eduardo Luz, Kraft Heinz’s global brand officer.He points to Devour, which was developed by Springboard, Kraft Heinz’s “incubator” unit, to identify disruptive brands. “We saw the needs of young males that want to eat — at some times of the week — a completely indulgent and rich meal without concern about calories,” he says. “They just want something delicious to eat while watching a football game.”More broadly, Mr Hees questions the notion that his products do not appeal to younger customers. He believes millennials will still eat processed and frozen foods along with healthier options.Devour’s “food porn” ads are also an example of how Kraft Heinz is prepared to do unconventional things to attract attention. “We prefer this risk to the indifference of people just skipping your ads,” Mr Luz says. Last summer the company’s Country Time Lemonade division said it was willing to pay fines for children who were running into trouble with the law for operating soft drinks stands without a licence.Ecommerce is another focus. Nina Barton, head of digital growth, says Kraft Heinz is “making massive investments” in technology to reposition for a digital future.While ecommerce has yet to transform groceries the way it has other industries, at least in the US, Amazon has launched an assault on the sector and executives believe it is only a matter of time before supermarket suppliers are disrupted.“This is going to be one of the biggest shifts in the industry,” Ms Barton says. “Our supply chain, fundamentally, was built for the Walmarts and the Krogers of the world. Amazon has a very different business model. We’re working in concert with them to figure out how to deliver on that.”Kraft Heinz is not alone in feeling the need to reinvest to improve revenues and reposition its businesses for the digital age. While not commenting on Kraft Heinz or 3G, Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer at PepsiCo, says: “There were some companies that chose what I would characterise as deep cost-cutting techniques.” He adds: “We think a balance between margin improvement and top-line growth is a more sustainable way to deliver value to shareholders.”“Investors recognise, generally, that higher revenue growth is generally a better way to deliver EPS [earnings] performance than simply through cost- cutting.”Some investors remain unconvinced, however. With the group’s investment plans putting downward pressure on margins, Kraft Heinz’s market value has dropped $30bn since the 2015 tie-up. In the same timeframe, the MSCI World Consumer Staples index has rallied 11 per cent. 3G last year reduced its stake to 22 per cent from 24 per cent.For all Kraft Heinz’s efforts to boost its top-line growth, many on Wall Street suspect it is only a matter of time before the Brazilians turn to their old playbook: dealmaking.Kraft Heinz executives do little to douse the speculation. “The food industry has not consolidated as much as many other industries — there will be more consolidation in the future and we do want to be a force behind that,” says Mr Hees.Since its $143bn swoop for Unilever collapsed almost two years ago, Kraft Heinz has stayed clear of large deals. Instead it has focused on far smaller bolt-ons such as the $200m purchase of Primal Kitchen, a purveyor of health-conscious dressings.Given the leverage of its balance sheet, Wells Fargo’s Mr Baumgartner says it is difficult to see how Kraft Heinz could “make the numbers work” in a transformative transaction. Net debt stood at about $31bn as of the end of September, equivalent to 4.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to S&P Capital IQ — relatively high compared with industry peers.“When the businesses were growing effectively and the environment wasn’t as difficult, the view was ‘we very much want them to continue’ [doing deals],” says Andrew Lazar, an analyst at Barclays. “Now, investors are a bit less sanguine about buying another slow-growth packaged food company.”At Kraft Heinz’s headquarters, the performance of senior executives is displayed openly on a chart on the wall — in common with every other salaried employee. Many would balk at the brutal transparency, but Melissa Werneck, head of human resources at the group, says the company is “unapologetic” about its approach.“This is not [a place] for everybody,” Ms Werneck says. “We don’t pretend to be [something] that we are not.”Asked to describe morale, she says: “We went through a huge cultural transformation. We cannot deny that. We had an acquisition [Heinz] six years ago and went through a merger four years ago.”Referring to some negative reviews and ratings on Glassdoor, the website where current and former staff leave anonymous reviews about employers, she says: “It’s expected when you see this — a company that went through this transformation — that we would have dropped on this score.”Those who have done well say the culture rewards results and hard work.Young talent is promoted quickly, says Alex Behring, managing partner at 3G, Kraft Heinz’s biggest shareholder. He was handpicked in his twenties to run the investment firm’s railway business in Brazil in the late 1990s. “I joined because I was immediately given a chance to build something very early on in my career,” he says.The 3G formula is simple, says Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz, right. “We work like crazy. We are completely obsessed with data. We have fun, and we like to enjoy building big things.”"
46;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-11-29T17:57:46Z;Kraft Heinz buys health conscious sauce maker Primal Kitchen for $200m;;Kraft Heinz has agreed to buy Primal Kitchen brands, which makes more health conscious dressings and condiments, as the large US packaged foods maker seeks to diversify its portfolio of products to better compete with rivals.The company controlled by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett, who are better known for executing mega deals, will buy Primal Kitchen for about $200m, Kraft Heinz said on Thursday, without disclosing further financial details.After the deal is completed the maker of Heinz Ketchup and Mayonnaise will be adding Primal Kitchen’s Paleo Ketchup and Mayo, which has higher protein and lower carbohydrate contents than the regular kinds to its arsenal of products.Kraft Heinz’s acquisition comes nearly two years after it failed in February 2017 to acquire Unilever for $143bn in a hostile takeover approach. Since then the performance of the Chicago-based company has been disappointing, with its share value dropping nearly 47 per cent.Kraft Heinz faces similar challenges as its rivals: changing tastes and a shift towards healthier food. Furthermore, in recent months food and beverage companies have also been experiencing a jump in costs related to raw materials and freight.Although analysts believe 3G Capital will soon be executing another large deal to help it address some of the secular problems the consumer industry faces of late it has focused on smaller transactions.Primal Kitchen, which will be continue to be run by its founders Mark Sisson and Morgan Buehler as part of Kraft Heinz’s Springboard platform, is the third small deal carried out by the US group since it merged in 2015. Kraft Heinz also acquired Australia’s Cerebos food and instant coffee for about $228m and Ethical Bean Company in Canada for an undisclosed amount.“Primal Kitchen is an authentic, premium and growing brand that fits perfectly with our core Condiments & Sauces categories, and we are excited to partner with the Company’s strong existing team to drive growth across multiple categories going forward,” said Paulo Basilio, US zone president for Kraft HeinzThe main objective behind the acquisition is to allow Primal Kitchen to leverage Kraft Heinz’s global distribution platform and experience in the food industry. At the same time Kraft Heinz believes that by retaining the founders of the acquired company it will continue to preserve a fast-growing start-up culture. Primal Kitchen brands will continue to be based in Oxnard, California.Mr Sisson said: “While our growth to date has exceeded all industry standards and expectations, our partnership with an industry leader like Kraft Heinz now offers an unrivalled opportunity to reach millions more of the consumers who have been seeking products like ours for years.”
47;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-11-12T00:01:00Z;Prada, Starbucks and Kraft censured over human rights transparency;;Prada, Starbucks and Kraft Heinz are among companies criticised for a lack of transparency on human rights in their businesses and supply chains, despite pressure from governments and an investor-backed group.Forty per cent of companies fail to show any evidence of how they identify and address human rights issues, according to the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, a not-for-profit group based in London.The CHRB released its second annual ranking of 101 global companies today. The body is backed by asset managers including Aviva Investors, APG and Nordea, as well as the Swiss, Dutch and British governments, and uses the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.It analyses companies using criteria including whether a board reviews human rights issues, how it ensures workers in supply chains are paid a living wage, and efforts to avoid child labour.“The overall picture is deeply concerning,” said Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors and chairman of the CHRB.“This raises questions for investors and consumers as to whether these companies are serious about avoiding harm to people in their pursuit of profits.”Forty of the 101 companies scrutinised could not show whether they were identifying human rights risks in their operations.The average score across all companies in 2018 was 27 per cent, up from 18 per cent in the first survey last year. The increase partly reflects methodological changes but CHRB said the main reason was better company disclosures, policies, processes and practices.Almost two-thirds of companies scored less than 30 per cent in the 2018 survey and more than a quarter scored less than 10 per cent.CHRB’s research, which was assisted by EIRIS Foundation, a responsible investment research group, was based on public information and voluntary additional disclosures from companies.Human rights is an area of increasing concern to investors. In part this reflects the emphasis on responsible investment but is also a recognition that violations can have a financial cost through lower share prices or litigation.Aviva, APG and Nordea, which manage more than $1tn between them, have told the CHRB that the 2018 benchmark will be a factor in their investment decisions. “It is an enormous risk,” said Alexandra Morris, investment director at Skagen Funds, a NKr65bn (£5.9bn) Norwegian investment manager. “We as investors have to push [company] managers.”Kraft Heinz, which scored 5.2 per cent, said it was disappointed with its score. “We do not believe it properly reflects our strong commitment,” the US food group said. “Kraft Heinz places a high value on an ethical and transparent supply chain.”Starbucks, which scored 8.5 per cent, said it would review the CHRB report in detail and would challenge it “in areas we feel the report inadequately reflects our robust commitments”.“We have instituted practices for decades…that give insight into our entire coffee supply chain, including our zero-tolerance policies for human rights infractions,” the group said.Prada, which scored 3.6 per cent, declined to comment.Those that performed well in the ranking included miner Rio Tinto, Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, and consumer goods giant Unilever, with scores of at least 65 per cent. Adidas was top performer with 87 per cent.
48;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-11-01T21:13:39Z;Kraft Heinz shares tumble as jump in costs bites;Ketchup maker loses almost 9 per cent in value as commodity price rises eat into sales;Kraft Heinz fell short of Wall Street forecasts for the third quarter and sent shares down almost 9 per cent in after-hours trading, after higher input costs and promotions outweighed an increase in sales.The company behind pantry fillers such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Oscar Mayer hot dogs reported higher net sales than analysts expected, but said investments and higher overheads, as well as promotional and commodity costs that hurt pricing, cut into its earnings.The results continued a recent trend among food and beverage companies experiencing a jump in costs of raw materials and freight costs.Net sales rose 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to to $6.38bn in the three months ended September, surpassing expectations for $6.31bn in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.But net income fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $630m, or 51 cents a diluted share, amid an increase in expenses. Adjusted earnings came in at 78 cents, 3 cents shy of Wall Street estimates, and down from 83 cents a year ago.“While a number of one-off factors — as well as our desire to insure customer service — held back profit in the quarter, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth going forward,” chief executive Bernardo Hees said in a statement.In the US, the biggest region for Kraft Heinz, net sales grew 1.8 per cent to $4.43bn. Pricing declined 2 per cent due to promotional activity in stores and commodity price impacts, the company said.Kraft Heinz, in addition to food rivals such as General Mills and Mondelez, has announced planned price increases in recent months in response to higher freight and commodity costs. Mondelez, maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, said on Monday it would raise prices on a number of its US brands from early next year.
49;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-08-13T12:06:33Z;Campbell Soup: canned heat;The inheritors have their work cut out if they wish to keep company;Canned soup was once as fine an industry to inherit as any other. Not any more. Campbell Soup has become one of the most beleaguered large food companies in America. Millennials are eschewing its processed food and retail consolidation is squeezing its profit margins. The company jettisoned its longtime chief executive in May. Now, activist Dan Loeb has arrived on the scene, agitating for a sale.Campbell’s heirs and heiresses have their work cut out. In the past two years, the company’s shares have fallen by one-third. In response to weakening soup sales, former boss Denise Morrison spent $6bn buying pretzel maker Snyder’s-Lance at a whopping multiple of 20 times ebitda, a cash earnings measure. Snacks have been a bright spot for packaged food companies and Campbell Soup already has well-known brand Pepperidge Farms. However, the steep price has left Campbell with a total debt/ebitda level exceeding five times. Its dividend yield is approaching 4 per cent. The payout is keeping the stock from further collapse.Since Ms Morrison’s ousting in May, the board has been considering alternative strategies. The most obvious is a sale, but it would not be straightforward. JPMorgan estimates that Kraft Heinz, which is the name that comes up most often in the context of potential buyers, could see its earnings per share jump 20 per cent in an all-cash, modest premium deal.But why would Kraft Heinz (or any company) be interested in buying a grab-bag business of soup, cookies, pretzels and carrots?Nearly half of Campbell Soup’s shares are owned by various descendants of founder John T Dorrance. Mr Loeb has teamed up with one family member, George Strawbridge. Together they own more than 8 per cent. If the rest of the family wants the company to remain in their hands they are going to have to step up their game just as their options are being reduced.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

50;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-08-03T12:15:03Z;Kraft Heinz still hungry for ‘big brand’ purchases;Food group’s shares jump on promise new products will help boost sales;The chief executive of Kraft Heinz said the food giant is still in the market to acquire “big brands”, even as it promised new products of its own would help it achieve sustainable sales growth.That promise — and the supporting evidence from better than expected revenues and earnings in its latest quarterly results on Friday — sent the company’s shares climbing as much as 9.4 per cent in early trading, on course for their best day in more than a year.Like its rivals, Kraft Heinz has been struggling to reinvigorate sales to increasingly health- and cost-conscious consumers. It has responded by pushing new products such as Just Crack an Egg, a microwaved scrambled egg breakfast for consumers who want an alternative to cereal, and healthy pre-packed lunch boxes called Lunchables.“We believe we are now in a position to drive sustainable top-line growth from a strong pipeline of new product, marketing and whitespace initiatives that are backed by investments in capabilities for brand and category advantage,” said Bernardo Hees, Kraft Heinz chief executive.We like big brands. We like business that can travel and [be] internationalThe optimistic tone came as second-quarter net sales rose 0.7 per cent from a year ago to $6.69bn, ahead of analyst expectations of $6.59bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, fell 0.4 per cent — better than the 1.9 per cent slide analysts had forecast. A 1.9 per cent drop in US organic sales was also shallower than consensus estimates of 3.3 per cent.“We saw consumption trends improve as Q2 unfolded,” Mr Hees said.The earnings release coincided with a report that Kraft Heinz has started talks to acquire Campbell Soup, the processed food group with a market capitalisation of almost $13bn. Mr Hees made no comment on the potential deal on a conference call with analysts, but said the company wanted to be a force behind consolidation.“We like big brands,” he said. “We like business that can travel and [be] international. We do like to take synergies from existing business and to reinvest behind brands, behind products and behind people.”Kraft Heinz was created after billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G orchestrated a $100bn merger of the two famous food names. They failed last year to add Unilever, abandoning a $143bn takeover offer that would have created the world’s second-largest consumer goods group.The company said on Friday that cost inflation had weighed on its bottom line, but it expected its profitability to improve by the end of the year and gain momentum next year. The company said tariffs are affecting foil and aluminium costs in the US and on some of its products in Canada.Second-quarter net income fell to $756m, or 62 cents a share, compared with $1.15bn, or 94 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The decline reflected certain impairment charges in the most recent quarter. Adjusting for those items, earnings of $1 a share, topped forecasts for 92 cents.
51;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-07-12T03:01:04Z;Glassdoor comments on job satisfaction cannot be ignored;Employee remarks show big differences between Europe and the US corporate culture;Mick Jagger famously could get no satisfaction. Nor can employees working at some of the world’s biggest consumer companies, judging by comments they leave on Glassdoor.The website, now entering its second decade, allows people to let rip about the pros and cons of their employers — and then rate them. UBS last week published its latest analysis of 23,000 reviews posted on Glassdoor for 19 consumer staples companies between 2015-2018. This shows big differences in employee satisfaction between Europe and the US.The happiest employees are to be found among a group of European and US staples companies. Four of the seven highest-scoring companies are European, including Unilever, Heineken, Nivea-maker Beiersdorf and Nestlé. The US companies are Procter & Gamble, family-owned Mars and Colgate-Palmolive.Most striking, however, is the markedly lower level of employee satisfaction at Kraft Heinz than anywhere else. The US ketchup company was merged with Kraft into a single food company in 2015 by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group. Overall employee satisfaction at Kraft Heinz languishes at 2.4 out of a maximum of 5, which is well below the next grumpiest set of employees at Kellogg. The US cereal maker gets a score of 3.2, according to the UBS analysis. Only 36 per cent of Kraft Heinz employees approve of chief executive Bernardo Hees. The company’s culture and values, and senior management, are also ranked last, both scoring 2.3 out of 5.3G is famous for its demanding work culture. At Kraft Heinz, employees’ targets are stuck above their desks for all to see. Glassdoor comments refer to the pressure: “Terrible work environment, impossible goals” said one, while another resented being “forced to work six days a week, constantly having someone breathing down your neck”.The upside of Kraft Heinz’s meritocratic policies was also highlighted. “Great compensation and promotion opportunities if you are willing to work very hard,” said one post. Another drily noted: “You get promoted because people are leaving.”UBS’s view is that companies which apply an extreme form of zero-based budgeting— setting budgets from scratch each year — typically have the least-satisfied employees. However, if cost-cutting goes too far, says Nik Oliver, UBS analyst, “you get a short-term boost to margins but the concern is that it impacts employee morale”.Kraft Heinz says its low ratings stem from its “significant transformation” since the 2015 merger. Despite this, it says, its employee turnover rate is the same as the industry average. “As our company continues to evolve, ratings on sites like Glassdoor will continue to improve . . . We are an exceptional employer for those who embrace our culture of meritocracy and ownership,” Kraft Heinz told the FT.Yet P&G, which has been through years of business underperformance and turmoil, tops the list for employee satisfaction, and culture and values. This may seem paradoxical, though employees refer frequently to good benefits and training when commenting on Glassdoor.Now, there are many reasons not to judge a book by its Glassdoor cover. Review sites arguably attract a disproportionate amount of venomous outpourings from disgruntled people, some of whom do not even work for the company any more. UBS says it screens out ex-employees but it is still impossible to know how genuine comments are.Why does this matter? Because regardless of how flawed such sites may be, job candidates are turning to them in increasing numbers. Last year, 29 per cent of career-seekers in North America used Glassdoor, Vault, Great Rated! or similar sites, to research a company. This was up from 20 per cent in 2014, according to the Talent Board, a recruitment research company.Consumer goods companies cannot afford to ignore the message from these sites. The days when traineeships at P&G, Unilever or Nestlé were the most coveted are long gone. Now, consumer companies face stiff competition for the best — including data scientists and digital media specialists — from the more glamorous tech sector. Accenture’s John Zealley says: “The companies that were once the ‘go to’ destination for budding brand managers are struggling to exude the same ‘sparkle’ for the next generation of talent.” He sees “a new war for talent as they increasingly compete with smaller, disruptive, founder-led start-ups and innovative technology players”.The challenge for consumer companies, wherever they are located, is to improve profitability while fostering the type of corporate culture that people want to work for. Not easy, but then again, as Mick Jagger would be the first to point out, you can’t always get what you want.scheherazade.daneshkhu@ft.com
52;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-07-08T04:01:25Z;‘A good living but a rough life’: trucker shortage holds US economy back;Some 70 per cent of goods are transported by road, but a shortage of drivers and soaring demand could put a brake on growth ;"The Miracle Mile in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, is a vital capillary in the US freight transport system. Linking interstate highway 81 to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the road is just an overnight drive away from half the country’s population. Thousands of trucks shuttle along it daily carrying everything from lumber to fizzy drinks. Their drivers are well served. Three truck stops offer showers, burgers, video games and diesel fuel. Stores sell tail lights and hub caps. The lonely can visit the Carlisle Truck Stop Ministry, its biblical tracts stacked in a white metal trailer, or a pornography emporium called Mature Fantasy in a red building behind a stockade fence. These days the mile also acts as a recruitment ground for desperate employers seeking new talent. The magazine rack inside the Petro truck stop is piled with brochures listing scores of openings for people with commercial driver’s licences. Roadside signs plead for applicants outside the offices of Knight Transportation, Keen Transport and ABF Freight. At the Flying J truck stop, driver Alvin Perry, taking a break before continuing his journey to North Carolina, says he has been poached four times in two years. “People change jobs all the time,” he says with a grin. “I just changed this week.” If the US economy — growing at about 2 per cent a year — is approaching maximum velocity, the trucking industry is a force governing its speed. Trucks move 70 per cent of goods in the country by tonnage, but fleets are nearing full capacity. The constraint is not equipment; it is a lack of drivers. Autonomous vehicles may one day rule the roads, but in 2018 every truck still requires at least one human in the cab. With the US unemployment rate at 4 per cent many workers have the option of a different livelihood and carriers report a shortfall of 51,000 drivers. The effects are rippling through the supply chain. Consumer and food companies ranging from Kraft Heinz and 3M to Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble have identified rising freight costs as a drain on business, and some are raising consumer prices to compensate. General Mills last month partly blamed rising transport costs for 625 redundancies it will make this year. Energy companies in Texas complain that difficulties in finding truckers are creating an obstacle to drilling for and marketing crude oil. “Transportation clearly is a big inhibitor to the expansion of the US economy,” says Tim Fiore of the Institute for Supply Management, a research group. “There is no short-term end in sight because driver labour is hard to find.”The tightness in the trucking market is attracting scrutiny as the economy shows flickers of inflationary pressures. The national average rate for hiring a “dry van” box trailer increased 30 per cent in the year to June to $2.32 per mile, the highest on record, according to DAT Solutions, an online trucking service. The Federal Reserve’s latest snapshot of regional economies lists truck driving as first among the jobs facing worker shortages. One North Carolina trucking company quadrupled rates in an attempt to curtail demand, “but found that some customers were willing to pay the new rates”, the Fed reported. It represents a remarkable turnround from 2015 when carriers bemoaned a “freight recession”. In the first five months of 2018, truck tonnage has raced 8 per cent higher year on year, according to the American Trucking Associations. Shares in listed trucking companies have risen twice as fast as the wider US stock market in the past year. Wages are also pushing upward after years of lagging behind inflation. Between December and June, median per-mile pay increased 8.2 per cent to 39.8 cents, according to the National Transportation Institute, a data group. Jumping ship can be lucrative. In February US Xpress, a carrier based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, announced that $50,000 bonuses and four weeks of holiday awaited two-driver teams. The median salary for drivers hauling fully loaded trucks on irregular routes across the US was $53,000, an ATA survey showed, relatively good pay for a job that does not require a university degree.The offers have led to plenty of job-hopping — employee turnover was 94 per cent among large truckload carriers in the first quarter, ATA says — but little recruitment from outside the industry. The 1.29m truck drivers identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in May was up 15,000 from April but still fewer than the number in the summer of 2015. The retail trade, a sector perceived as dying, has added more than 300,000 positions in the same period. “I don’t really see any solution to the driver problem, unless the economy slows and the unemployment rate rises,” John Steele, chief financial officer of Werner Enterprises, a Denver-based carrier, told a conference in June.Trucking has actually fallen as a share of total US employment, says Rob Martin, economist at UBS. He says that while the tight market has raised freight costs for shippers, competition between online and traditional retailers has so far kept a lid on consumer prices. Driving a truck across America has never been an easy job. Spending weeks on the road can be solitary, dull and, federal statistics show, more likely fatal than service as a police officer. Sleep often comes in the bunk of a cab bathed in the fumes of other idling vehicles. It is not the first time drivers have been scarce. In 1999, at the height of the dotcom bubble, the Financial Times reported an “acute” shortage during the festive season rush. The squeeze reappeared during the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But this is different, industry veterans warn. “It’s probably the tightest driver environment that I’ve seen,” says Eric Fuller, US Xpress chief executive. Not just anyone can walk in to a job. Big-rig drivers need to first earn a Class A commercial driver’s licence after a training course that can take six weeks and cost several thousand dollars. To cross state lines a driver must be at least 21 years old, putting long-haul routes off limits to recent school graduates and dropouts as they start their careers. New drivers must also pass drug tests, a significant hurdle as companies dip deeper into the labour pool. Carriers are increasingly testing hair follicles as well as urine, enabling detection of substances used months earlier. This makes it harder for those who are only recently drug-free. JB Hunt, a large national carrier, recorded 1,213 job applicants who tested positive for drugs using the hair test in 2017, according to Trucking Alliance, an industry group. Nine out of 10 of them had passed urinalysis.John Snyder admits the career is not for everyone. In his 42 years on the road he has driven millions of miles through 46 US states. He was often out of town during his family’s Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. “I missed both my kids’ graduations,” he says over a late lunch of ketchup-covered eggs and coffee at a Denny’s restaurant. His children are now in their 30s. Neither drives a truck. Mr Snyder is on his third marriage. “It’s a good living, but it’s a rough life. It takes a great deal of personal sacrifice and commitment to do the job. That’s why there’s a shortage,” he says. Observers say the trucking shortage reflects a loss of union representation across much of the industry, irregular pay often based on miles driven and the results of inflated promises to recruits. The male-dominated and peripatetic nature of the industry has made it difficult to attract women. Only 4 per cent of drivers are aged under 25, according to ATA, suggesting the industry is struggling to lure younger workers who have plenty of options in construction, energy and other blue-collar sectors. The country music star George Strait recorded a tribute to long-haul truckers. “Freedom’s your best friend,” he sang to them, calling drivers “brothers of the highway, children of the wind”.If freedom was ever a selling point, it is gone now. Truckers describe a life of increasing surveillance. The most recent constraint came in April when a grace period ended for enforcing the use of electronic logging devices, or ELDs. The gadgets track whether drivers are following a daily limit of 14 hours on duty, including a maximum of 11 behind the wheel, removing the opportunity to cheat — and make more money — with the use of paper logs. ELDs may make highways safer. But they have also effectively removed truck capacity just as the strong economy demanded more cargo loads. In the first quarter, enforcement of the rule created demand for another 80,000 drivers, above and beyond that from the strong freight market, says Noel Perry, a consultant with Transport Futures. Veteran drivers such as Ted Hendrickson believe the devices impinge on his liberty. “ELDs seem to think they know when I’m tired,” says the 66-year-old driver from Texas, smoking a cigarette during his 10-hour break. Dante Staciokas, a driver relations manager for a Pennsylvania-based carrier, says the job began to change in the 1980s, when the industry was deregulated. As carriers competed on price and sharpened their focus on costs a “meat in the seat” mentality took hold, he says.“Driving a truck went from being a profession in which to aspire to one of the most stressful occupations in the country. Truckers found their jobs had become very much like that of the products they hauled: a disposable commodity,” says Mr Staciokas. Truck customers, known as shippers, no longer have the whip hand. The ratio of loads requiring transport to available truck vans has surged 80 per cent in the past year to 10 to one, according to DAT Solutions. Shippers must now pay higher rates for prompt service. Even then, there is no guarantee a truck will arrive. “There is freight for which we can’t take a big enough rate increase to deal with the inefficiencies that our drivers experience. So we just say that’s business we’re not doing,” Chris Lofgren, chief executive of Schneider National, a leading carrier, told a New York conference. Warehouses are putting on a beauty pageant in the hope of building a reputation as a “shipper of choice”, says Josh Brogan of AT Kearney, a consultancy. This means quicker loading times, cutting penalties for tardy truckers and treating drivers with respect. Load skidded steel coils in Franklin, Ohio. Had planned to make the pick-up the night before but the air conditioning in the cab died. Had to install a new compressor which took time.Deliver coils to customer in Brownstown, Indiana.

Return coils to customer in Franklin and go home.894$2,700Average out at about $1 per mile so around $900, of which fuel would account for almost $500A bad warehouse reputation travels fast. “This is the closest to hell that you’ll ever be,” a driver warned in an online review of an Atlanta supermarket distribution centre. “The employees are rude, there’s no parking, it takes hours to unload, full of hookers, scam artists, crooked cops, and the only thing missing is Dolores Umbridge [from Harry Potter] with her pink bow. Avoid coming here at all costs.” America’s loading docks may become further strained as retailers stock up for the winter holiday shopping season. Mike Regan, whose consultancy TranzAct Technologies advises shippers on logistics, warns it will last well into 2019. “Call it the freight-pocalypse,” Mr Regan says. “It’s not going to change any time soon.” Autonomous vehicles could eliminate as many as three in five heavy and tractor-trailer truck driver jobs starting in 2030, according to research from Securing America’s Future Energy, a Washington-based advocacy group that backs the technology. If that proves to be the case it will turn a shortage into a glut and leave Silicon Valley and Washington grappling with the social costs and benefits. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, chief executive of Starsky Robotics, is developing trucks that drive themselves along intercity highways and operate by remote control. He calls the process of filling cabs a chronic problem for the sector. “You can’t solve that problem if you still need a person in a truck,” he says. “We’re making trucks that operate without people.”McKinsey, the consultancy, estimates that self-driving vehicles could eventually reduce trucking labour costs by as much as 90 per cent. Carriers may use the threat of an automated future as a “hammer” to suppress driver wages, warns Sam Loesche, legislative representative at the Teamsters union. In June companies including Daimler, FedEx and Uber launched a lobbying group, the Partnership for Transportation Innovation and Opportunity, to address AVs and jobs. And Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas congresswoman, introduced a bill to fund the retraining of workers displaced by self-driving vehicles in a sign of the growing concern. “The issue is not if new jobs will arise eventually in the wake of AV displacements (they most certainly will),” says the Safe survey. “But whether AV adoption will impose very high costs on displaced workers, their families and communities.” "
53;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-07-06T04:15:25Z;American ketchup next on EU’s list of trade targets;Brussels prepares to counter possible US car duties by targeting household staples;Targeting iconic American products such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon in the fight against US president Donald Trump’s first round of transatlantic tariffs was just a start — the EU is now eyeing humble staples such as ketchup.European officials said the much-loved tomato sauce condiment is one of dozens of products set to be included on an €18bn retaliation list being drawn up by the European Commission as it prepares for a decision by Mr Trump to hit EU cars and car parts with punitive duties. Other items likely to be included on the list include frozen fish, raisins, suitcases and even adhesive bandages. The EU is bracing itself for a decision by the US in the coming weeks on whether imported cars and car parts constitute a national security threat.The investigation follows repeated complaints from Mr Trump that the US car industry is treated unfairly and his threats to impose a 20 per cent tariff on car imports. The EU now charges a 10 per cent tariff on imported passenger vehicles that is higher than the 2.5 per cent duty applied by the US, although the US also has a 25 per cent tariff on light trucks.Such treatment, Mr Trump argues, has led to a $151bn trade deficit in 2017 with the EU.Mr Trump earlier this year applied tariffs to steel and aluminium imports from the EU as part of a broader crackdown on metals imports, prompting the EU to retaliate against €2.8bn worth of US goods. Those tariffs prompted Harley-Davidson to announce that it was moving some production outside the US to avoid the EU tariffs. Bourbon makers have also complained that the new European import taxes will hit their sales in the EU.Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU’s trade commissioner, told national ambassadors on Wednesday that the bloc needed to be prepared in case arguments against the car tariffs from governments and business fell on deaf ears, with a possibility that the US might introduce measures as soon as September. Brussels estimates that as much as $58bn worth of EU products could be hit by Mr Trump’s new tariffs on cars and parts. This means that, if the EU were to apply the same procedures it used in the case of steel and aluminium, it would then target as much as €10bn worth of US products with equivalent duties. European officials said opting for an €18bn list would give the EU more flexibility when setting the level of additional tariffs applied to US products. It would also provide some room for manoeuvre as the commission prepares to consult with national governments on the precise contents of the list. Whether the EU is now considering the right targets to counter the auto tariffs is unclear. Kraft Heinz, the Pittsburgh-based maker of Heinz Tomato Ketchup, already has substantial manufacturing operations in Europe. A spokesman for the company told the Financial Times that all the tomato sauce it now sells in Europe is made in Europe. Kraft Heinz has already become embroiled in Mr Trump’s trade fight with Canada, which put tomato sauce on its list of retaliatory tariffs. But the company closed its Canadian ketchup plant in 2014.The preparations come even as the EU steps up efforts to dissuade Mr Trump from imposing the car tariffs, which it is feared would lead to an all-out trade war. An EU commission official declined to comment on the list, saying “there’s no US decision. We are not going to speculate on any possible scenarios that might materialise or not.”Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, is preparing to travel to Washington later this month with a proposal for so-called pluri-lateral talks among the world’s major car exporters on lowering tariffs. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the idea on Thursday. A spokeswoman for Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary who is overseeing the investigation into possible auto tariffs, pointed to recent comments by him saying it was premature to say if the tariffs would even go into effect.Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, indicated backing for that idea at a press conference on Thursday, saying talks among all countries active in the international car market “could be an option that I can imagine”. But she also qualified that remark, saying any such discussions would have to be in compliance with World Trade Organization rules. A spokeswoman for the French economy ministry also underlined that any trade talks with the US could only happen once Mr Trump’s tariff “threats are lifted”. “The EU must continue to remain united in its position with respect to the US. That is what gives our position strength,” the spokeswoman said. “Any new position must be agreed by all EU member states” and trade talks “would need to benefit the EU as a whole”, she added.

54;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-07-02T04:00:52Z;Nestlé: Betting on big brands;The fate of the Swiss group will be a defining test for an industry under pressure from changing consumer tastes and activist investors;"Mark Schneider pours a can of cold brew Nitro Nescafé coffee in the company’s head office overlooking Lake Geneva, Switzerland. He points out the distinctive cream “head” on the dark liquid. “You see that foam building up!” he exclaims.Testing new products is the fun part of heading the world’s largest food and drinks company. More difficult for Nestlé’s 52-year old German chief executive is rebuilding sales growth and profits in an industry roiled by rapid changes in consumer tastes, increasingly severe cost competition and a plethora of mergers and acquisitions.With annual revenues last year of SFr90bn ($91bn), Nestlé is larger than Japan’s Sony and just smaller than Russian energy producer Gazprom. Its best-known brands include KitKat chocolate bars, Perrier bottled water and Purina pet food.But size per se is looking less attractive. Nestlé’s sales growth has slowed substantially , smaller rivals and start-ups have taken market share and the company’s shares have fallen more than 9 per cent during the past year. To fight back, Nestlé is trimming costs and buying up smaller rivals. But crucial to its success will be products that excite the next generation of consumers.The group has a SFr1.7bn annual budget to research and develop products, such as new ways of serving coffee. Others in the industry might see this as something to cut to boost profitability. “I just want payback,” says Mr Schneider. “I want a steady stream of must-have, winning products.”Nestlé’s fate will serve as an important test for consumer goods companies at a time when the multinationals which have dominated the industry for decades are under threat like never before.Some of Nestlé’s competitors are taking radical action. Procter & Gamble has cut prices and sold off more than half its brands. Unilever is reducing bureaucracy and costs.But Nestlé is betting that a more incremental approach will pay dividends. Three years ago Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Nestlé’s former chairman, attacked 3G Capital, the private equity group founded by Brazilian investors, for having “pulverised the food industry with serial acquisitions and ruthless cost-cutting”. Last year, Kraft Heinz, controlled by 3G and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investment group, launched an audacious $143bn bid for Nestlé’s Anglo-Dutch rival Unilever. That bid flopped — but had it succeeded, Nestlé itself could have been next in private equity’s crosshairs, despite its size.Nestlé has not been immune to these pressures: last September it added profit margin targets to growth objectives. Such targets were a main demand of US investor Daniel Loeb, whose Third Point activist hedge fund a year ago revealed a 1.25 per cent stake in Nestlé, worth $3.5bn. Mr Loeb argues that the group has a “muddled strategic approach” and should move faster to shed underperforming and non-strategic businesses, as well as reduce layers of bureaucracy.However, Nestlé is sticking largely to its traditional reliance on leveraging its size. Mr Schneider has announced bolt-on deals in high-end US coffee and food and a $7.2bn tie-up with Starbucks, but “he is still at the beginning of what could be a long journey”, says Celine Pannuti, an analyst at JPMorgan.Feb 17 Materna (infant nutrition products).

*Nestlé paid Starbucks $7.2bn for rights to distribute the US chain’s packaged coffee.Founded in the 1860s as a baby food manufacturer in the lakeside town of Vevey, near Lausanne, Nestlé has faced criticism that it was too slow to adapt to a digital age which has cut the cost of market entry for media savvy start-ups.“Nestlé and other global players have left smaller competitors to grow for too long before reacting . . . It’s the old Nestlé thinking, ‘we’re number one, we’re the best’,” says Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Vontobel bank. “The world has changed for good.” Mr Schneider was the first outsider to be appointed Nestlé chief executive in almost a century, joining from German healthcare group Fresenius.His diagnosis is that there is no specific Nestlé problem. Rather, the entire food industry had “collectively” overlooked a revolution in consumer behaviour after “a history of 30, 40 years of almost uninterrupted success”.Mr Schneider adds: “Many of these changes have been under way for the better part of a decade, but it’s only now that they really come to the surface and are plainly visible.”Consumers have moved away from traditional packaged foods, preferring less processing and more artisanal, fresher options. A plethora of smaller companies have sprung up to cater to them. New foods and beverages have become “almost a form of entertainment”, Mr Schneider says.Nestlé has more than 30 brands with more than SFr1bn of sales. “Can these big brands grow, given brand fragmentation and the desire of millennials for smaller brands?” asks Warren Ackerman, an analyst at Société Générale.The Swiss group’s answer is, Yes. “‘Too big’ is a notion I disagree with,” Mr Schneider says. “Size, if you can handle it, should be nothing to be afraid of; in fact size gives you a whole lot of good things.”Nestlé, which is organised to keep operations close to local markets, has tried to “handle” its size in the past. A decade ago, Mr Brabeck pushed through a programme to speed up decision-making. But Andrew Wood, an analyst at Bernstein, says Nestlé missed important consumer trends. “Just because something is decentralised, it doesn’t mean it will be successful if the culture is risk-averse or the organisation doesn’t want to disrupt itself,” he argues.He estimates Nestlé’s sales should be growing at above 5 per cent based on its size in the categories in which it operates, instead of half that rate. “The world has moved on a lot quicker than Nestlé. It needs a fundamental change in the way it runs its businesses — a change of culture,” says Mr Wood. One investor adds: “No one expects them to be as nimble as a start-up. But there’s a gap between being nimble and asleep.”Nestlé admits some weaknesses. In the US, it was slow to introduce organic versions of its Gerber baby food, allowing smaller rivals to enter the market. Critics say it missed the fashion for flavoured waters and premium frozen foods. Mr Schneider is careful, however, not to criticise past Nestlé managers — his immediate predecessor, Paul Bulcke, is now chairman of its board and Mr Brabeck-Letmathe is chairman emeritus.In any case, he argues, Nestlé does not need a radical overhaul. Although it has underperformed rivals in terms of profit margins, its organic, or like-for-like, sales growth has been at the top of the industry range. “We are not a turnround story . . . we’re talking about adjusting to a changing industry.” Some changes at Nestlé have been small but symbolic. Mr Schneider has torn up the seating plan for meetings of his top executives and allowed them to sit where they want — a revolutionary move in conservative Swiss business. More strikingly, Nestlé has hired expertise from other fast-changing retail industries: Pablo Isla, chief executive of Inditex, owner of the Zara clothes chain, and Kasper Rorsted, chief executive of Germany’s Adidas sportswear group, have been added to the board. Nestlé’s most important task is to adjust its portfolio faster, in line with consumer trends. “Over 150 years, that has been our job,” Mr Schneider says. “It just now happens at a faster pace.” Nevertheless, Nestlé can afford to be a “fast follower” of fashion — waiting for others to establish a concept before adopting it. “Sometimes it is actually good to have entrepreneurs test out trends first.”In the past year, coffee has been an important battleground for Nestlé and one of four priority, fast-growth markets — the others are bottled waters, baby food and pet foods. The Swiss company has a global lead thanks to Nescafé, a brand which this year marks its 80th anniversary. But JAB Holdings, the Luxembourg-based family investment group, which owns Keurig Green Mountain, has moved fast over the past five years to assemble a coffee empire that is challenging its global dominance. To keep its advantage, the Nescafé brand is being overhauled. “You can play it by region, you can play it by coffee type,” Mr Schneider says. “There’s Nescafé Arabian coffee, there’s Nescafé Nitro cold coffee, there’s all sorts of things that play extremely well under the Nescafé brand. What’s important is that you keep innovating, you keep offering something new.”In the US, where soluble coffee has never taken off, the group has expanded its Nespresso coffee capsule business and has launched a series of high profile acquisitions. Last year, it bought the California-based hipster Blue Bottle coffee store chain and the Chameleon cold brew coffee company. In May, it struck a $7.2bn deal with Starbucks for the rights to sell the US brand’s packaged coffee outside its café chain — Nestlé’s third-biggest acquisition ever. “Before last year, Nestlé had never done an M&A deal in coffee — Starbucks will be its third in a year,” says Mr Ackerman of Société Générale.JAB is pursuing opportunities in casual dining and food — as highlighted by its Pret A Manger purchase last month. In contrast, “we’re pursuing a very coffee centric strategy”, Mr Schneider says. “This town is big enough for the two of us — and several more,” he says. This is not “an epic fight”.In other areas, however, Mr Schneider has so far been less radical. Underperforming US confectionery businesses were sold last year, but Nestlé remains committed to other sweets markets — relying largely on its flagship KitKat brand. Mr Schneider points to the new variations of the snack bar — his favourite is a pink version made from newly-invented “ruby” chocolate. Analysts are more sceptical. “Asian millennials want to try new, innovative, funky products but in Europe, it’s going to be difficult to sell pink or wasabi KitKats,” says Mr Bertschy of Vontobel. Similarly, Mr Schneider has so far disappointed those calling for Nestlé to dispose of its US frozen food business. Nestlé has a 29.6 per cent share of the US frozen food market, according to Société Générale, but would be overtaken by the proposed $10.9bn merger between ConAgra and Pinnacle.Despite Mr Schneider’s reputation for deals at Fresenius, he is cautious about M&A at Nestlé and agrees that its record is not stellar. A lesson from his Fresenius days is that “an organisation can only do so much at the same time”, he says.Nestlé has long identified consumer healthcare — covering skincare, nutrition and other products sold in chemists — as an area for future growth. But in the past year, it has spurned the opportunity to buy healthcare units put up for sale by Germany’s Merck and Pfizer in the US, although it spent $2.3bn buying Atrium Innovations, a Canadian nutritional products company, from private equity group Permira. Also unresolved is Nestlé’s remaining 23 per cent stake in L’Oreal, worth about €27bn, a remnant of a deal struck in 1974 when L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt feared nationalisation by France. Third Point has called for it to be sold.“They should and will sell it sometime, most likely to fund a larger acquisition,” says Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co, whose clients include Nestlé shareholders. “If there is no obvious way to spend the proceeds within a reasonable period of time, our long term preference would be for Nestlé to buy back shares.”Since last year’s failed Kraft Heinz bid for Unilever, some believe opinion is shifting in Mr Schneider’s favour. “There is a change of wind among investors,” says Ms Pannuti at JPMorgan. “A lot of them are pushing back on the idea that margins are everything. The most highly rated companies are those delivering top-line growth.”Mr Schneider prefers constant innovation over drama. “I never saw any benefits in creating fear and havoc . . . with massive organisational announcements that really take people’s eye of the ball. It’s about evolving to basically be in lockstep with the times, and that to me is a continuous job.” This piece was revised to reflect that Alphabet’s 2017 revenues were greater than those of Nestlé.It was in 1867 by the shores of Lake Geneva that Henri Nestlé developed an instant milk formula for infants. Today infant formula is still one of the fastest-growing segments of the food industry, along with coffee and water, which are also core Nestlé products.Since then Nestlé has grown to dominate the food industry with annual sales last year of Sfr90bn. But the last time it achieved its organic sales target of 5-6 per cent growth was in 2012. The rate of growth has fallen steadily since, reaching 2.4 per cent last year — the lowest anyone can remember and the target has since been abandoned.Compared to peers, this was actually not a bad performance. Danone, Tyson Foods of the US and Unilever, the Magnum ice-cream and Lipton tea producer, all grew faster, but mainly driven by price rises. Nestlé outperformed these companies in terms of volumes sold, according to OC&C, the consultants.The worst-performing food companies are in the US. Kraft Heinz, Campbell and General Mills all reported a fall in organic sales last year.However, Nestle’s profitability has been one of the main criticisms of activist investor Third Point. Operating profit margins were stuck at about 16 per cent for the best part of a decade, which is below the industry average, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Margins ticked up last year as they must continue to do if they are to reach the 17-18 per cent target by 2020 which Nestlé, under pressure from Third Point, promised to investors last year.Where Nestlé scores highest over most rivals is in the amount it spends on research and development — Sfr1.7bn, equating to 2 per cent of sales — and on marketing and promotion. The strength of the Swiss franc has been a drawback as the group only makes 1.4 per cent of its sales in its home country. According to Morgan Stanley, Nestlé would have generated an additional CHF28bn of revenues over 2010-2017, had the Swiss franc remained at 2010 levels. Scheherazade Daneshkhu"
55;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-29T21:00:27Z;Increasingly wealthy Chinese go upmarket in consumer spending;Local businesses steal march on multinationals that fail to notice market shift;Chinese consumption has become so large that the country is the most important market for luxury and car companies — and is driving sales for global healthcare, entertainment and apparel brands.For decades the ruling Communist party’s encouragement of saving to fund domestic investment and the accumulation of foreign capital through export surpluses meant even as workers’ incomes rose, they struggled to afford goods that their country exported.By 2008, household consumption had fallen to 36 per cent of China’s total spending from 47 per cent in 2000. This compared with 70 per cent in the US, while disposable incomes averaged just $2,200 per year. As a result, multinationals drawn to China by the prospect of 1.3bn consumers often retreated disappointed.But since 2008, a tighter labour market boosting wages and capital gains from a housing price boom more than doubled average incomes, which reached $5,800 last year. Consumption has been the single biggest driver of growth since 2011, and household spending approaches 40 per cent of GDP.“It’s new households coming into the middle class stage which is driving consumption,” says Daniel Zipser of consultancy McKinsey. “The auto industry very much depends on China. The beauty and sports industries have a high share of their global business coming from China.”Rising affluence has been most visible in the automobile sector. China overtook the US as the world’s largest car market in 2009 and while the pace of growth has slowed, 29m vehicles were sold in China last year compared with 18m in the US.Volkswagen generated 41 per cent of its sales in China, while GM made 39 per cent and Ford 24 per cent in 2016, with profits generally an even higher proportion, according to consultancy Evercore.Chinese consumers became the world’s biggest spenders on luxury brands in 2012, according to consultancy Bain, and now account for around a third of global purchases — mostly by Chinese tourists overseas.But as price differences fall, luxury sales are returning to China with sales there accounting for a rising share of global luxury brands’ income — 27 per cent of sales last year for French group Kering, which owns brands such as Gucci, and 35 per cent for Swiss brand Swatch.Beyond luxury, China is now the world’s leading consumer of smartphones, while its movie and sportswear markets are second only to the US.That has driven sales for multinationals such as cinema group Imax which made a third of global revenues in China last year. China accounted for about 20 per cent of Apple and Adidas’ global sales, while Nike and Starbucks made about 10 per cent of global revenues in the country.China overtook Japan to become the world’s second largest drug market in 2013. Britain’s AstraZeneca made $3bn in China sales last year, about 13 per cent of its global total while the US’ Pfizer made 7 per cent of its revenues in China last year, trailing only the US and Japan.Chinese consumer market growth comes from premiumisationWhile there are headwinds to China’s consumer market such as rising personal debt, the risk of a housing bubble and slowing productivity growth, analysts are bullish on prospects for the next decade. Disposable incomes will expand by nearly 8 per cent a year through to 2020, according to brokerage CLSA, which predicts that the household savings rate will fall to 27 per cent.The number of affluent households with annual income over Rmb136,000 ($22,000) will nearly double from 82m in 2015 to 137mn in 2020, according to research group Gavekal.China’s consumer market is now firmly in a middle-class stage, where growth comes from selling higher-quality products. Volume sales of pork, beer and instant noodles have peaked in recent years. “China has already reached a good consumption level in terms of volume for all the food and beverage categories, so growth comes from premiumisation,” adds Mr Zipser.That should be good news for foreign brands, who sell more premium products. But in practice Chinese consumer brands have been faster to adapt to the upgrading trend than multinationals.In China’s urban fast moving consumer goods market, worth $190bn, Chinese companies’ sales grew more than 8 per cent in 2016 compared to just 1.5 per cent for foreign brands, according to a report from Bain and Kantar Worldpanel.The consumer divisions of multinationals can be hampered because they make key decisions outside China, analysts say. “Chinese brands are squeezing the global brands if [the latter] have not caught up to the upgrading trend,” said Max Lin of asset manager Actis.Some multinationals are changing the way they operate. Kraft Heinz last month launched a premium range of cookies resembling its Oreos but priced “significantly” higher than the real thing as well as domestic brands.To design the product. the company moved people to China and “built a local team based on Chinese knowledge,” says Ze Dias, China managing director at Kraft Heinz. “We like to operate like a smaller business. When it comes to how to win in the market it has to be decisions made by local people that are close to consumer needs”.New regulations will drive emissions cheats off road / From Jesse Norman MP, London, UK
56;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-24T03:00:30Z;US consumer staples plunge as bond yields rise;Another problem for staples is a notable shift in consumer tastes;As technology stocks set the pace for US equities in 2018 and help sustain the S&P 500 in positive territory, the grim performance of consumer staples companies is a reminder that some sectors are struggling.The S&P consumer staples group has fallen some 13.4 per cent in the year to date compared with a rise of more than 9 per cent in the tech sector.Rising bond yields have hurt sentiment for consumer staples companies, a group that includes Clorox, Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, and which sports a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.11 per cent, well above the 1.9 per cent of the whole S&P 500.Other so-called bond proxies, such as utilities, are also hurting this year, with that group down more than 6 per cent so far in 2018.Another problem for staples is a notable shift in consumer tastes. Demand is moving from traditional packaged food products to organic and natural products, according to analysts.For some, such changes in consumer appetite are already curtailing pricing power at a time when input costs are rising thanks in part to higher commodity prices.In an early sign of margin pressure for consumer staples companies, Wall Street estimates for revenue growth have risen slightly since the start of the quarter while analysts are dialling back forecasts for earnings per share, resulting in a decline in expected net profit margin for the second quarter to 6.8 per cent from 7 per cent as of March 31, according to FactSet.“Pricing power is an issue,” says Patrick Palfrey, equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “Many companies are facing higher input costs — for example, food input prices and shipping costs — but they lack the ability to pass that on to the consumer. Consumer preferences have changed. People are looking for a different set of products [than] many of the traditional staples retailers.”Read more: US Treasury yield eases back from seven-year peak
57;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-18T17:48:34Z;Campbell Soup woes knock wider packaged food stocks;;Campbell Soup is on track for its worst one-day drop in over 19 years on Friday following a profit warning and the abrupt departure of its chief executive.But the comments from the food and snack giant on higher transport and commodity costs are also weighing on the wider US packaged food and beverage sector.Here is a rundown of some of the moves in midday New York trade:Companies from tyre maker Goodyear to trash bag and bleach maker Clorox to airlines have all sounded the alarm bell on rising cost pressures this earnings season.But for big food companies, the squeeze is being felt on multiple fronts — with higher crude and metal prices driving up packaging costs while the rebound in agricultural prices is driving up input ingredient costs. Rising fuel prices and a tighter labour market are also running up the amount companies are having to shell over for transport and logistics.All this is coming at a time when many of the companies are struggling with declining sales of their mainstay brands. This in turn makes it harder for them to pass on the price increases to bargain savvy consumers, especially given the ever growing number of new entrants in the food and snacks market.Anthony DiSilvestro, Campbell’s chief financial officer said in a call with analysts, that he is expecting costs for everything from carrots to cardboard packaging to go up this year.“We’re seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items,” he said. “For example, we expect double digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that driven or all of it’s driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.”“We’re also expecting higher inflation on wheat and vegetables and resins and corrugated,” he added. “So this is a meaningful shift in the inflation outlook.”
58;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-14T03:01:25Z;Human rights activists name and shame giant companies;Non-profit warns over reputational damage and access to capital;Kraft Heinz, the food and drinks company, and fashion businesses Macy’s, Hermès and Prada have been criticised for a lack of transparency on human rights issues in their supply chain after failing to engage with a government and investor-backed group.The Corporate Human Rights Benchmark — a non-profit based in London and New York that is backed by asset managers and pension funds including Aviva Investors, APG and Nordea, as well as the Swiss, Dutch and British governments — is to release a report next week.It will say that some companies are paying greater attention to issues relating to workers. It warns, however, that a quarter of groups it has targeted in the clothing, agriculture and extractive industries have failed to engage, ignoring letters from an investor coalition that oversees $5tn in assets as well as invitations from CHRB.The reluctance of some businesses to discuss human rights comes despite investor concern about supply chain risks after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh five years ago, where more than 1,000 workers died. Companies including Walmart, Primark, Matalan, Mango and Benetton all used the garment factory.Some investors are also increasingly worried about modern slavery. One senior executive at a UK pension fund said that many big companies had slavery in their supply chains.Last year, more than 5,000 people were referred to British authorities as potential victims of slavery, up a third in a year. In 2016, the owner of a company that supplied beds to Next and John Lewis was jailed for exploiting what was described in court as a “slave workforce”.Steve Waygood, chair of the CHRB board and chief responsible-investment officer at Aviva Investors, said that five years on from the Rana Plaza disaster, it was good to see that many companies were taking human rights seriously.He added, however: “We should all be concerned by the lack of engagement from around a quarter of companies, particularly as they are in priority sectors concerning serious human rights impacts.“Issues such as modern-day slavery, worker safety and freedom of association can be material to the financial performance of these companies and they may risk restricted access to capital due to reputational damage and regulatory backlash.”These large companies, including Kraft Heinz, Macy’s, Hermès and Prada, had some of the lowest scores in the benchmark, indicating what CHRB said was a lack of transparency and public commitment to managing human rights risks and impacts.Prada declined to comment. Kraft Heinz and Hermès did not respond to a request for comment.Macy’s said: “Integrity and good corporate citizenship are deeply ingrained in our business. We respect the work of the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark. While we were not able to participate in the earlier benchmark, we are open to another discussion with CHRB.”The CHRB said that, working with existing and emerging investor coalitions, it would push for greater corporate transparency and engagement in 2018. It will also begin looking at the media and tech sectors in 2019.
59;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Flavour-maker IFF buys rival Frutarom in $7bn deal;Changing consumer tastes are driving a rush of food industry deals;International Flavors & Fragrances, a manufacturer of ingredients for many of the world’s top food products, has acquired Israeli rival Frutarom Industries, highlighting how changing tastes are driving consolidation in the sector.IFF, whose shares have risen more than 41 per cent in the past four years, has a market value of $11bn. The New York-based company said on Monday the acquisition of Frutarom will transform it into a global leader in natural scent and flavouring and accelerate its exposure to small and midsized customers.The acquisition of Frutarom for $7.1bn including debt will help IFF gain new smaller health-conscious brands, which are enjoying higher margins than those controlled by consumer conglomerates such as Unilever and Kraft Heinz.IFF shares fell 9.6 per cent to $128.47 amid concerns that the company might be overpaying for the deal.At the heart of the deal is the need faced by most of the industry to catch up with consumers who increasingly demand natural — rather than artificial — scents and flavourings.“People are looking for more clean labels,” Andreas Fibig, IFF’s chairman and chief executive told the Financial Times. “The kind of brands that you’d find at Whole Foods.”The deal came on the day that snack giant Mondelez said it would pay $500m to acquire Tate’s Bake Shop, which makes its cookies with brown sugar and butter rather than corn syrup and vegetable oil.Consumer goods giants across the globe are battling to ignite sales as shoppers turn away from products that delighted previous generations, like cans of sugary cola and processed cookies.The deal will fold Tate’s cookies, brownies and pies, which are sold through upmarket stores like Whole Foods, into the Oreo empire of Mondelez. Tate’s “gives us an attractive entry point into the fast-growing premium cookie segment”, said Dirk Van de Put, Mondelez’s chief executive.The race to meet changing consumer tastes has fuelled a series of deals in the flavour and fragrance industry — which is dominated by IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich and Symrise — as the incumbents look to acquire smaller, millennial-friendly brands.Geneva-based Givaudan, a top flavours and fragrances maker, recently acquired French natural ingredients group Naturex for $1.6bn.Analysts say F&F companies are indispensable to the consumer goods industry and can therefore command a premium for their products, as subtle differences in flavours are often the reason why consumers prefer one brand over another.Under the terms of the deal Frutarom’s shareholders will receive $71.19 in cash and 0.249 of a share of IFF common stock for each of their shares. The offer values Frutarom at $106.25 per share — an 11 per cent premium to the Israeli group’s closing price on Sunday.Frutarom, which sells over 70,000 products to more than 30,000 customers in over 150 countries, said it expects to take in more than $1.6bn in sales this year and aims to hit $2.25bn in sales by 2020.
60;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-02T20:32:38Z;Kraft Heinz organic sales soften but tax reform props up profit;;Higher costs and lower US demand saw Kraft Heinz’s organic sales drop yet again, as the food giant behind brands like Heinz ketchup and Jell-O tries to revive lacklustre growth.The company said that net sales dropped 0.3 per cent to $6.3bn in the three months to the end of March. Organic net sales fell 1.5 per cent overall, falling 3.3 per cent in the US, rising 5 per cent in Canada, notching a 2.3 per cent advance in the Emea region and gaining 3 per cent in the rest of the world.Net income attributable to common shareholders ticked up 1 per cent to $993m, or 81 cents a share, thanks in part to a boost from US tax reform.The company cited higher input costs, lower US net sales, investments in building out its capabilities and lower taxes as key factors influencing its results.Chief executive Bernardo Hees said:”Our first-quarter results were consistent with, if not slightly better than, the expectations we expressed in February. The initial successes we’re seeing in the marketplace, together with the strong investments we’re making in marketing, new product innovation, and capability-building, give us increased confidence in delivering the top- and bottom-line growth we expect in 2018.”Analysts had been looking for net income of $999m, or 81 cents a share, on sales of $6.3bn, according to Factset. Organic sales had been tipped to fall 1.2 per cent overall, with a 3 per cent decline in the US.Kraft Heinz, which was created by a $100bn deal in 2015 orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G, has been struggling to regain its footing after a sluggish 2017, amid shifting consumer tastes. It has hinted that it may be open to more dealmaking, even after its attempt to gobble up rival Unilever in a $143bn takeover deal fell short.After falling almost 11 per cent in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares are down 30.12 per cent so far this year. Shares rose 5 per cent in after-hours trading following the results.
61;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-05-02T04:00:43Z;Scepticism over ‘value’ comeback despite energy surge;Investment strategy gains are over-reliant on one sector, reflecting little broader shift;Energy shares were the top US market performers over the past month but the move has not been enough to renew faith that “value” investing is on the way back.The S&P 500 value index nudged ahead of its “growth” investing counterpart during April, with gains of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.But analysts were nonetheless reluctant to declare a shift in market dominance between the two diverse styles of investing — the gains in April were not supported by other key sectors considered to be classic value plays.Value investors look for companies trading at a discount to their future cash flows or break-up value while growth investing entails buying companies that offer the hope of above-average growth but often trade with a larger price tag.“Value is working but not because of any macro investor preference for cheap stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “Rather, it comes down to sentiment about energy stocks and the near-term direction of oil prices.”The energy sector gained more than 9 per cent in April to lead the S&P 500. Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
62;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-04-20T04:01:29Z;Warren Buffett heads for board exit at pivotal moment for Kraft Heinz;Company has had a miserable year since its thwarted $143bn bid for Unilever;Warren Buffett on Monday will step down from the board of Kraft Heinz after five years, leaving the food group in which his Berkshire Hathaway investment company has a 27 per cent stake with an uncertain future.The 87-year-old made the announcement in February— almost exactly a year after Kraft Heinz’s failed $143bn bid for Unilever— giving his reason as a wish to travel less.His departure comes at a pivotal time for Kraft Heinz and has raised questions about his relationship with 3G Capital, the New York-based private equity group founded by Jorge Paulo Lemann that is the other major shareholder.Mr Buffett told the FT: “My stepping down from the board represents no change of any kind in my or Berkshire’s relationship with 3G. I am on no public boards (except Berkshire) and expect to be on none in the future.”Kraft Heinz has had a miserable year since the thwarted Unilever bid — its most recent quarterly earnings disappointed and its shares have slid by 30 per cent year-on-year.“There is no question that our financial results in 2017 did not meet our potential,” acknowledged Bernardo Hees, chief executive in February.Though Mr Hees talked about a step-up in investment and the potential for organic growth, some analysts appear unconvinced. They believe that another M&A deal might be getting closer, while fearing for the consequences if Kraft Heinz fails a second time.“Organic growth is not Kraft Heinz’ expertise”, said analysts at Credit Suisse in a recent note. “We harbour serious doubts about the management team’s ability to generate sufficient product innovation to grow its collection of retro brands in highly-commoditised categories.”Mr Lemann, Brazil’s richest man, has been a friend of Mr Buffett since the two met on the board of Gillette 20 years ago. Mr Lemann and Marcel Telles, another of the three Brazilian men who founded 3G, are also on the Kraft Heinz board.In many ways, Mr Buffett and Mr Lemann are one of the corporate world’s more unlikely pairings.The Sage of Omaha cultivates a cosy, avuncular image as a friendly investor who cherishes incumbent management. But 3G Capital, set up by Mr Lemann after making a fortune at Anheuser-Busch InBev, has a reputation for buying businesses, throwing out managers — 11 of the top 12 Heinz executives left on one day — and ruthlessly slashing costs.In other ways, they are well-suited: to start with, folksy elder statesman Mr Buffett gave the Brazilian group instant credibility in the US.Moreover, Mr Buffett’s hunt for “elephant” deals was well-matched by 3G’s formidable ambition.Mr Buffett wrote in his 2015 letter to Berkshire shareholders: “I knew immediately that this partnership [with 3G] would work well from both a personal and financial standpoint.” However, Mr Buffett did not come cheap for 3G. The $8bn of preferred stock Berkshire Hathaway invested originally in Heinz earned a whopping 9 per cent dividend. (Berkshire separately invested a total of nearly $10bn in Kraft Heinz common equity.)The $3bn Berkshire provided to fund 3G’s purchase of coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons also paid 9 per cent.Mr Buffett and 3G teamed up in 2013 to buy Heinz and then took it public again when they merged it with Kraft in 2015. But it was third time unlucky when it came to Unilever in 2017.Mr Buffett admitted pulling the plug on that acquisition in the face of fierce resistance from Unilever, which went against his mantra of friendly deals. “It became very apparent that Unilever did not want the offer. I got calls that it was unwelcome, and I said: if it’s unwelcome, there’s no offer,” Mr Buffett told CNBC, soon afterwards. Adding that English was the second language of Alex Behring, Kraft Heinz’s Brazilian chairman and 3G chief executive, Mr Buffett said: “I’ve seen misunderstandings before — that’s one reason why I like to do it the way I do it. I say: I’ll make you an offer if you want one.”More recently, Mr Buffett and Kraft Heinz appear to hold different views about the investment climate. Mr Buffett said in this February’s shareholder letter that valuations “proved a barrier to virtually all the deals we reviewed in 2017 as prices for decent, but far from spectacular businesses, hit an all-time high”.Only a few weeks earlier, Mr Hees told analysts that: “valuations today are more attractive than they were even two months ago. And the chapter of Kraft Heinz integration is behind us.”Given that both are keen dealmakers, these differing views on valuations, as well as Mr Buffett’s opposition to more hostile deals, could be blocking 3G’s M&A ambitions for Kraft Heinz.Alexia Howard, analyst at Bernstein said: “Some investors have interpreted Buffett stepping down from the Kraft Heinz board as that Kraft Heinz could be inclined to go after a hostile deal. I don’t know what their intentions are but at the margin, it seems as though it may be more possible than it was with Buffett on the board.”The pair’s dealmaking ambitions may have also been upended by their own success.Most of the large packaged consumer food companies, such as General Mills and Kellogg, have defensively initiated their own heavy cost-cutting programs to try to pre-empt shareholder activism or an unsolicited knock on the door.Nevertheless, Mondelez is often cited by analysts as the best substitute for Unilever. Like the Anglo-Dutch company, a large proportion of its sales are to emerging markets and it has well-known brands, including Oreo biscuits and Cadbury chocolate.One person familiar with the situation said that 3G had teed up a deal, only to have it upended by the election of Donald Trump. Mr Trump’s protectionist rhetoric and willingness to target specific companies would have made cost cuts and plant closures tricky.But when asked last September whether Kraft Heinz would buy Mondelez, Mr Buffett said: “I think the answer is no.”If 3G still hopes to bid for Mondelez, it could be easier with Mr Buffett no longer on the Kraft Heinz board. Nevertheless, Berkshire Hathaway does still have two board seats, including long-time Berkshire executive Greg Abel, who is vice-chairman. Mr Buffett is being replaced by Alexandre Van Damme, who is close to 3G’s founders. He is on the board of AB InBev and Restaurant Brands International, through which 3G owns Tim Hortons and Burger King.Though Credit Suisse analysts see Mondelez as a likely target, they also believe hostile bids are unlikely: “Our sense is that Kraft Heinz and 3G still view a hostile deal as a last resort and that it remains aligned with Berkshire’s views.”Without Mr Buffett’s firepower — Berkshire has $116bn in cash and Treasury bills, according to his latest annual letter — 3G looks unlikely to be able to manage a huge deal, such as PepsiCo, which is also seen as a target.Kraft Heinz’s share slide has also reduced its purchasing power. The company’s valuation multiple has fallen to a 5 per cent discount from a 16 per cent premium in February 2017, meaning it would need to issue 45 per cent more shares if it wanted to buy Mondelez for shares, according to Credit Suisse.Mr Buffett may still be happy to back Kraft Heinz financially. “Berkshire Hathaway may lower its profile in future Kraft Heinz deals, maybe participating via preferred stock but not necessarily contributing equity to future levered-acquisitions,” said Pablo Zuanic, analyst at Susquehanna International.A person who knows Mr Buffett said: “He really cares about his image as Uncle Warren. I think he’ll do more deals but he doesn’t need to sit next to them in the public eye. It’s one thing to sit next to someone and it’s another to invest with them.”Warren Buffett’s relationship with 3G has been “highly lucrative” for Berkshire Hathaway even with the weakness in Kraft Heinz shares over the past year, according to Jay Gelb, an analyst at Barclays.Berkshire invested $4.4bn alongside 3G when the two teamed up to take Heinz private in a $28bn deal in 2013.The sprawling investment conglomerate lent $7.7bn to buy preferred stock as part of the deal, which paid Berkshire $720m a year in interest and was redeemed by the company in 2016. Mr Buffett invested a further $5.3bn when Heinz swallowed Kraft in a deal announced in 2015.The value of that near $10bn equity investment in Kraft Heinz surged to nearly $30bn in 2016, but has tumbled alongside the company’s 34 per cent share price decline over the past 12 months.James Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, put the current fair value at just under $20bn, roughly $2bn above the carrying value that Berkshire has on its books.The company still earns dividends of roughly $800m a year from its Kraft Heinz investment.“You can call it a win but the substantial decline in the Kraft Heinz share price recently . . . has cut into their economic value created in this transaction,” Mr Shanahan said.Berkshire and 3G also teamed up when Burger King took Tim Hortons private, with Berkshire lending $3bn to the company at a 9 per cent interest rate. The company paid off that obligation last year.Eric Platt in New York

Meanwhile, shares in Anheuser-Busch InBev are down 7 per cent and have fallen nearly a third since 2015.Taken together, the moves suggest souring sentiment towards big brand consumer staples, often thought of as safe value stocks, and, with it, ebbing confidence in 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity firm that holds a controlling stake in Kraft Heinz alongside Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.3G Capital, which turned AB InBev into the world’s biggest beer company, has garnered a formidable reputation in food and beverage, slashing costs to improve margins and deliver high returns.3G and Mr Buffett bought Heinz in 2013, adding Kraft and merging the two in 2015. Shares in the group rose from $73 in July 2015 to $96 in February 2017.But a failed hostile bid for Unilever last year raised eyebrows while net sales fell
1 per cent from 2016 to 2017. JPMorgan has slashed its target for the stock from $81 to $65, due to “meaningfully lower multiples . . . as well as heightened concerns about fundamentals”.Both companies also carry heavy debt burdens. AB InBev is aiming to get its leverage down to a 2 times net debt to ebitda ratio but is a long way off at 4.8 times for the 2017 financial year. Kraft Heinz’s ratio has reduced slightly but was still 3.8 per cent for 2017, according to Bloomberg data.Read more: Consumer goods: big brands battle with the ‘little guys’"
64;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-04-18T20:33:32Z;Unilever: the Rotters’ club;Investors could, in theory, put a spoke in the plan to quit London;One place is much like another, according to the nineties pop song “Rotterdam”. Not to UK investors resisting Unilever’s choice of the Dutch city as its primary base. They want the consumer goods giant to retain a London registration too. Their objections have no better chance of succeeding than the bid approach that spurred Unilever’s decision to retreat from London’s hurly-burly.The misgivings would be easier to share if they concerned high barriers to takeovers in the Low Countries. Chief executive Paul Polman was plainly spooked by the tilt from Kraft Heinz last year. He even called for curbs on the UK’s free-and-easy takeover regime.Instead, some UK funds are annoyed Unilever will probably lose membership of the FTSE 100 index when it drops the first half of its Anglo-Dutch identity. They would have to sell shares in the Rotterdam-based group to comply with internal rules precluding non-FTSE investment. This would be irksome. Unilever has produced tolerable long-term growth, much of it, piquantly, from foreign markets.A minority of investors could, in theory, block the rejig. Only a quarter of investors in Unilever’s UK arm — speaking for around $17bn of a combined market capitalisation of some $150bn — would need to vote against it this autumn.Even so, Unilever says it is confident it will win the vote. It knows which funds are restricted to investing in FTSE constituents. Members of a wider club would therefore need to join the insurrection to force a U-turn. Big US fund managers who regard Europe as a single investment pool are unlikely to play ball.That is capitalism. The people with the most money win. A broader complaint of Unilever’s disgruntled minority has wider resonance. It is that Unilever makes decisions that suit the top management, expecting shareholders to rubber stamp them later. Mr Polman talks a lot about Unilever’s duties to stakeholders. Yet it sometimes appears as though his favourite song is another hit penned by the Beautiful South: “I’ll Sail This Ship Alone”.Sign up to Lex’s new midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters.
65;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-03-21T15:40:43Z;Cereal killer? Food stocks fall on General Mills forecast;;Wall Street has lost its appetite for big consumer food companies after General Mills — the US-based maker of foods ranging from Lucky Charms cereal and Nature Valley granola bars to Yoplait yoghurt — trimmed its forecast citing “sharp increases in input costs” affecting the broader industry.Just ahead of lunchtime in New York, shares of rival breakfast cereal maker Kellogg were down 3.5 per cent to $63.90. Other consumer food giants were also weaker:•JM Smucker down 4.2 per cent to $120.40•ConAgra Foods down 3.8 per cent to $35.03•Campbell Soup down 2.9 per cent to $41.84•Hershey off 2.15 per cent to $98.18•Kraft Heinz down 1.4 per cent to $62.29General Mills itself is down 9.6 per cent to $45.12, putting it on track for their steepest one-day decline since March 2009.Many of the largest US food companies have been grappling to adapt their portfolios to account for shifting consumer tastes, both in terms of a preference for fresher, healthier offerings and a cost-conscious approach to how they fill their shopping carts. That has left investors worrying about how the companies will be able to trim costs to fortify their bottom line while still finding new ways to expand their share of grocery store shelves.
66;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-03-19T00:01:19Z;Multinationals fail to name palm-oil producers;Greenpeace surveyed 16 consumer goods companies about the origins of the raw material;Leading consumer goods companies including Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson and Carex soap maker PZ Cussons have failed to disclose the producers of their palm oil supplies, despite pledging to achieve traceability in one of their key ingredients.A report published by environmental group Greenpeace on Monday asked 16 companies to publish the names of their palm oil producers, but half — Ferrero, Hershey, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, PZ Cussons and Smucker’s — did not.The other half — Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Mars, Mondelez, Nestlé, P&G, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever — have disclosed producer lists, although all eight revealed that their supplies still included palm oil from producers that destroy rainforests.Many consumer goods use palm oil, from ice cream and nut spreads to soap and shampoo, and environmentalists have blamed the clearing of land for its production for destroying vast tracts of forest in south-east Asia over the past few decades.Some 24m hectares — an area almost the size of the UK — of Indonesia’s rainforest was destroyed between 1990 and 2015 according to government estimates, while a recent study from academic journal Current Biology revealed that more than 100,000 Bornean orang-utans were lost between 1999 and 2015.Western consumer goods groups have been under pressure to ensure that their raw material is purchased from sources with sound environmental and labour practices.But Greenpeace said unless palm oil users traced the source of the products, deforestation would continue. “We can’t end deforestation by box-ticking,” said Richard George, forests campaigner at Greenpeace.Of those that failed to disclose their palm oil producers, PepsiCo and Ferrero confirmed that they would do so in the near future. PepsiCo reaffirmed its commitment to using 100 per cent certified sustainable palm oil by 2020 and said it would publish its list of producers “in the coming days”. Ferrero said it would be producing a full list of the mills from which it sources palm oil in May.Hershey said it had mapped more than 99 per cent of its palm oil supply chain to the mills, and identified 14 per cent of the plantations where its palm oil comes from but would not publish the names due to confidentiality agreements.Other companies emphasised transparency over confidentiality.Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer at Unilever, which was the first consumer group to publish its producer list earlier this year, said: “Due to traditional commercial sensitivities and the complexity of the palm oil supply chain, it has required perseverance to get to where we are now.” He added that “complete transparency is needed for radical transformation”.Nestlé said its ambition remained that, by the end of 2020, all of the palm oil it used would be both traceable and responsibly sourced.Alastair Child, vice-president of global sustainability at Mars Wrigley Confectionery, said the company would use its influence to push for further changes while Jonathan Horrell, director of sustainability at Mondelez, acknowledged that the company’s work was not over and pledged to speed up progress on the ground. Reckitt Benckiser said more needed to be done with the entire industry.Kellogg’s said it had shared its list of suppliers with Greenpeace, but did not challenge the group’s report. Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PZ Cussons and Smucker’s did not respond to requests for comment.
67;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-03-15T19:10:07Z;Aloof British government helped steer Unilever to Rotterdam;Paul Polman was afforded regular contact with the Dutch PM but UK relations were icier;"Unilever’s road to Rotterdam — the site chosen for its new single legal base— began with a hostile takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, in the chaotic aftermath of the Brexit vote.Paul Polman, Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, was to describe the $143bn shock approach from the US company as “a near-death experience”. Yet none of this seemed to matter much to the UK government.During those traumatic days in February 2017, Mr Polman’s fight to fend off Kraft Heinz coincided with a period in which relations between business and the UK government reached a nadir.Mr Polman’s relations with Theresa May were icy, in common with those of many other chief executives who found it impossible to organise face time, or phone calls with the prime minister, even in moments of corporate crisis.I had to unfortunately explain to people in the [UK] government what the impact was of a company like thisMrs May had made a conscious decision to distance herself from big business as part of a strategy — devised by her former adviser Nick Timothy — to align herself with the interests of working families.Mr Polman, head of Unilever since 2009, privately fulminated at the apparent lack of interest from Mrs May about the fate of a company that ranked among the top five in the FTSE 100 index. The Anglo-Dutch group can trace its British lineage back to 1884 when Victorian philanthropist William Hesketh Lever — later Lord Leverhulme — began making Sunlight soap. It has 88,000 pensioners in the UK.“I discovered that I had to unfortunately explain to people in the government what the impact was of a company like this,” Mr Polman told the Financial Times in November. The experience was in sharp contrast to the regular contact that Mr Polman had with Mark Rutte, the Netherlands prime minister who had previously worked at Unilever and lobbied hard to claim it as a truly Dutch company.Mr Rutte faced down political protests over lowering corporation tax and scrapping a dividend tax. Unilever highlighted that “the Dutch dividend withholding tax will be abolished from 1 January 2020”. There was nothing similar it could point to from the UK in Thursday’s announcement.In the UK, Rhys McCarthy, national officer at the Unite labour union, pointed to apathy in Westminster: “Theresa May has talked about toughening up rules to stop aggressive asset-stripping takeovers, but done little to nothing. Her continued inaction could lead to more companies like Unilever fleeing overseas.”Unilever would say it is not taking flight. It bent over backwards on Thursday to emphasise that it was committed to investing in the UK. Its two fastest-growing businesses — personal care and home care — have always been located in the UK and will continue to be nurtured by £1bn of annual investment in marketing and research and development.Downing Street denies that Mrs May neglected Unilever; in recent months Number 10 has been kept fully informed about its restructuring plans and drew up a joint media strategy with the company to deal with the fallout.Indeed, Mrs May concluded from her June 2017 election setback that the Conservatives could not afford to neglect their reputation as the party of business and sound economics. Doors to corporate Britain, including Unilever, reopened and Mr Polman said the government had “woken up”. Unilever was itself woken up by the bid from Kraft Heinz, the US food company controlled by hard-nosed private equity group 3G Capital with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Mr Polman quickly saw off the bid, which acted as a catalyst for investors to demand higher returns more quickly. Unilever promised €6bn in cost-cuts, two-thirds of which will be reinvested, unveiled a €5bn share buyback and finally sold its declining margarines business.Unilever managed to offload the spreads unit for $7bn to US buyout fund KKR in December. But it realised that if it had wanted to spin it off, Unilever’s dual-headed legal structure would have made this “very, very complex”, according to Graeme Pitkethly, finance director. With a single share class, Unilever will be able to issue stock more easily for a large acquisition — or sell its food and refreshments business, which it centralised into one headquarters in the Netherlands.The Plc shares were 2 per cent lower in London trading on Thursday and 1 per cent lower in Amsterdam. Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies, says: “The modest negative reaction reflects the enhanced protections of the Dutch takeover code and a shift into a Mitteleuropean, rather than Anglo Saxon, capital market milieu.”There are good reasons for the Unilever board, chaired by Marijn Dekkers, to have chosen to be incorporated in Rotterdam, which the Dutchman outlined: the NV company is bigger than the Plc, with 55 per cent of the ordinary shares and has more liquidity. According to UBS, the trading volume in the NV shares is 1.5 times higher than in the Plc.Shareholders have welcomed the simpler structure. But though Unilever pledged to abide by both UK and Dutch corporate rules, one shareholder says: “We do think Unilever is a well-governed business. But Mr Polman is likely to leave within the next 12 months and later on, a new management might view things differently.”The fact, however, is that both the UK and the Netherlands are small in the context of the multinational’s overall business, 92 per cent of which is conducted outside the two countries.Boris Johnson, foreign secretary, said of Unilever’s choice of Rotterdam was “really an accounting decision”, while chancellor Philip Hammond said it would not affect the amount of tax paid by the company in the UK and was limited to “a relatively small number of jobs”.Unilever may have resolved the question of its legal base in favour of the Netherlands but investors are still awaiting one outstanding decision, write Philip Stafford and Cat Rutter Pooley.It must choose a nationality for inclusion in some of the biggest stock market indices. It is a critical choice for investors because it affects portfolios that track benchmark indices in the UK and Europe. As one of the continent’s biggest groups, its nationality affects billions of pounds of investors’ money.What happens in the short term?Unilever wants just one type of share — Dutch. To help trading in the UK, it plans to create depository interests, UK securities that represent shares in overseas groups.Each depository interest represents one share, and they can be traded electronically in much the same way as ordinary stocks, just not in paper form. They also allow investors to trade and receive dividends in sterling, helping boost liquidity, and to secure an exemption from paying stamp duty.Why the uncertainty?Unilever says it will decide its index nationality after having discussions with index compilers such as FTSE Russell and Stoxx. It is also seeking a premium listing in London, which would make it eligible for the FTSE 100. Analysts have judged that prospect unlikely because FTSE Russell can only assign Unilever a UK nationality if its shares fail a liquidity test in its country of incorporation.“Looking at the rules, it’s really hard to see what Unilever’s argument will be as the key liquidity rule for the Netherlands will be passed,” says Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies.But FTSE Russell’s standards for assessing non UK-incorporated companies leave plenty of room for manoeuvre. They include where a company’s products are made, where its shareholders are based and the country where most transparent share trading takes place.Where are its shares traded?Unilever argues there is more liquidity in its Dutch shares than its UK stock. Last week about €1.4bn of its Dutch shares were traded compared with £630m in London, according to data from Fidessa.The truer picture is more complicated. Fidessa data show only two-thirds of the Dutch shares trade on the Amsterdam market, with the rest on UK-based alternative venues and dark pools. All trading in the UK shares takes place in London. To give it the “strategic flexibility” it seeks, Unilever may argue that the pool of liquidity for the combined company’s shares is greater in London than Amsterdam."
68;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-02-28T04:01:06Z;Consumer goods: big brands battle with the ‘little guys’;Large companies squeezed by innovative offerings from smaller rivals are now adopting their business models in search of higher growth;"Fairfax Hall was sipping a gin and tonic in Union Square, New York, with his childhood friend, Sam Galsworthy, when the idea struck. It was 2006 and the friends from the drinks industry had noticed how a handful of artisanal distilleries had sprung up in the US, following the boom in craft breweries.“What fascinated us was seeing the reaction to these little distilleries. People really do care where, and how, things are made,” says Mr Hall. There was a contrast with his employer at the time, Diageo, the world’s biggest distiller and owner of global brands like Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka. “What these little guys were doing was almost in direct opposition to where the world of fast-moving consumer goods [FMCG] had been going — of globalisation and big companies getting even bigger.”The two men decided to join the “little guys”. Three years later, they established Sipsmith as the first traditional copper gin distillery in London since 1820. At £30 a bottle, its Sipsmith’s London dry gin costs twice as much as Diageo’s Gordon’s and one-third more than its upmarket Tanqueray gin. Despite this, Sipsmith sales have soared, and just over a year ago it was swallowed up by Japan’s Beam Suntory, the world’s third-largest distiller — though Mr Hall and Mr Galsworthy continue to manage the business.The acquisition is emblematic of one tactic employed by some large consumer groups trying to reverse five years of weakening growth . In 2016, revenues of the large consumer goods companies — from beer to soft drinks, food and household products — grew at their slowest rate since 2009, when the recession took hold. The 2017 results for many of those companies that have reported remain weak.These trends might not be new but the industry is now facing fresh questions over whether it can restore the high growth rates these groups once enjoyed — and if it cannot what will be the reaction of investors? Bain and Company, the consultancy, says that on current valuations, the market expects these groups to return to organic growth rates of 5 per cent a year by 2020, but its own forecast is for 2 to 3 per cent over the next three years. The gap between the two forecasts could add up to as much as $70bn in lost value according to a Financial Times calculation.“Companies will need to fundamentally revisit their way of working and transform themselves,” says Matthew Meacham, Bain’s global head of consumer products. “If they stay with the model of mass marketing, big sales forces, large investments in big manufacturing plants, they will struggle.”It is not just the proliferation of voguish upstarts like Sipsmith that poses a problem for consumer goods companies. People are changing the way they shop at a time when digital technology has made it easier for companies without large marketing budgets to reach consumers online removing the dependence on traditional distribution routes.One way for consumer companies to combat such trends has been to innovate, create desirable new products, and charge more for them. But they have ceded ground in this area. “Large, fast-moving consumer goods companies are highly skilled at executing known business models,” says Richard Taylor, analyst at Morgan Stanley, “but their record on true radical innovation over the past 20 years is downright dire.”Bain and Company estimate for organic revenue growth for FMCG groups in 2020, against market expectations of 5%Sales transferred from large to smaller companies in North America between 2011 and 2016, says Boston Consulting GroupNestlé’s annual growth target which it recently abandoned. It recorded revenue growth of 2.4% in 2017Such groups have been remarkably slow at spotting the changes in tastes. Younger consumers are breakfasting on Kind cereal bars or Chobani yoghurt, using Harry’s or Dollar Shave Club razors, drinking Peet’s coffee, laundering with plant-based Seventh Generation detergent, then relaxing in the evening with a BrewDog craft beer or Tito’s vodka and Fevertree tonic.According to Boston Consulting Group, $22bn in industry sales transferred from large to smaller companies in North America between 2011 and 2016 and there has been a similar trend in Europe. The share of the consumer goods market held by smaller companies, grew from 23 per cent to 26 per cent over the same period, say BCG and IRI research group.As a result, and despite rising global demand, 34 of the world’s 50 biggest consumer companies are suffering either from slower sales and profits growth, or both, according to Bain. Their revenues grew at an annual average of 7.7 per cent between 2006 and 2011 but that fell to just 0.7 per cent between 2012 and 2016. Average growth in annual operating profits was barely a quarter of what it had been in the earlier period, according to the consultancy.Nestlé abandoned its 5-6 per cent annual revenue growth target after missing it for four years. Its 2017 revenues of SFr89.8bn ($96bn) were only 2.4 per cent higher than in 2016 — the lowest rate of growth this century. Among the worst hit are leading US packaged food companies, such as Campbell of tinned soup fame; General Mills, owner of Yoplait yoghurt and Cheerios cereal; Kellogg’s and Kraft Heinz.The Anglo-Dutch group that makes everything from Axe deodorants to Hellmann’s mayonnaise has been buying up small high-growth and innovative companies. Chief executive Paul Polman has spent €9bn on 19 bolt-on acquisitions since 2015 including Dollar Shave Club, the subscription-based razor company, Seventh Generation, an eco-friendly laundry group, and Carver Korea, the Seoul-based maker of skincare products.Cheaper, private-label products have added to the problems faced by the consumer groups and fuelled the growth of retail discounters such as Costco, Aldi and Lidl, and spurred a cut-throat price war between supermarkets and online sites, including Amazon. Cyclical problems such as currency fluctuations, a slowdown in emerging markets and the difficulty of raising prices because of low inflation in the US and much of Europe, have all contributed to making “today’s environment one of the most volatile and uncertain that I’ve seen in my 35 years in the industry”, said Irene Rosenfeld, before stepping down in November as chief executive of Mondelez.The producer of Oreos biscuits and Cadbury chocolate bars eked out just 0.9 per cent growth in organic net sales last year, down from an already modest 1.5 per cent in 2016.This relatively weak financial performance has made even the biggest companies vulnerable to activist investors agitating for changes to boost profitability, including Nelson Peltz of Trian investment group at P&G, and Dan Loeb’s Third Point at Nestlé.Many have felt compelled to cut costs by the approach 3G Capital took at Kraft Heinz. The “ruthless cost-cutting” led by the Brazilian investors has had a “revolutionary impact” on the food industry, said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestlé chief executive and now its chairman emeritus. At Kraft Heinz, controlled by 3G and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investment group, profits have shot up but sales have gone down, sparking a huge debate about how to strike the right balance between profits and higher revenues.The 3G model looked unstoppable — until last year when it encountered a rare defeat. Kraft Heinz was forced to back down from an audacious $143bn bid attempt for Unilever after encountering huge resistance from the Anglo-Dutch group. Yet the fact that Kraft Heinz was confident enough to target a company with double the sales underscored the vulnerability of even the biggest names in the sector.The UK company behind Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen painkillers last year split its business into two units under the umbrella of the group, each with its own profit and loss account, to increase accountability. Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive, says the group’s $18bn acquisition last year of Mead Johnson, the US infant formula group, precipitated the change: “Large companies are finding it difficult to outperform the markets. And the reason is large companies are facing smaller, nimbler, niched competition . . . a ‘one size fits all’ approach is an outdated approach.”The large groups have sought to combat the new threats in different ways. But virtually all have adopted some form of zero-based budgeting, the cost-cutting programme popularised by 3G’s model of justifying costs across the board every year. This has helped drive up profitability.Many have adapted their products. Others have tried to buy growth; merger and acquisition activity has cranked up, with some groups acquiring the very start-ups that challenged their dominance. Unilever has bought 19 small companies over the past two years while Danone spent $12.5bn on WhiteWave, the US natural and healthy foods company. They have also been divesting low-growth businesses — Unilever sold its Flora and Becel margarines business last year.Then there is more far-reaching structural change. Procter & Gamble, the world’s second-largest consumer group, owner of Tide detergent, Pampers nappies and Gillette razors, has slashed the number of brands it manufactures from 170 to 65 since 2004. Jon Moeller, P&G’s finance director, told an industry conference last week that “P&G is a profoundly different company than just a few years ago”. Yet Chas Manso, analyst at Société Générale, says: “Overall it is still losing global share and underperforming on organic sales growth.”So can these large organisations, structured for mass production, really cater for the greater customisation demanded by modern consumers? Can their problems be solved by adapting to new technology and a rebound in emerging markets?John Zealley, senior managing director of consumer goods and services at Accenture, says the groups need to take more risks to balance “investment in innovations that will have more volatile returns” with restoring core products. But he argues that they must also take advantage of their scale to exploit areas like data analysis. “Much in the same way that ‘fast fashion’ reinvented the mass clothing market, so modern consumer product groups need to reinvent the mass consumer market,” he adds.Valuations in terms of price-to-earnings ratios have proved resilient and suggest investors believe the companies can do this. “A substantial weight of investors don’t seem terribly concerned,” says James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “We think that’s a mistake.”Mr Edwardes Jones has calculated that the return on investment among European consumer staples fell by 60 per cent in the past five years, compared with the previous seven, making it more expensive for the big companies to drive sales growth.“This reflects an alarming rise in the cost to compete that has yet to be assimilated into share prices. These companies used to have the security of Swiss government bonds with some growth and yield thrown in; that’s no longer the case. Given the low growth and loss of market share, the sector is overvalued,” he argues.“I don’t think Halo-Top would have been able to exist say 20, 25 years ago,” says Justin Woolverton, the Los Angeles-based founder of the sugar-free added-protein ice cream brand.Launched in 2012, within five years the brand was outselling Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s and Nestlé’s Haagen-Dazs in the US, in standard pint-sized tubs. Mr Woolverton says: “With digital, you can really make your limited dollars work. [Before digital] you would have had to take out a newspaper ad or do a radio or TV ad — if I had started with $10m, we could have done something. Now if you have $100, you can target people who are going to be much more receptive.”Some investors agree. Raphaël Pitoun, chief investment officer at Seilern Investment Management, says: “The reaction of these companies is really telling: they are adding more debt, doing more M&A with high execution risks and increasing share buybacks. It is all reminiscent of the telecoms sector before the crash of 2001.”Seilern has sold most of its holdings in consumer staples and is “focusing instead on a few well-positioned brands that look set to accelerate their growth prospects and margins through digital transformation”, says Mr Pitoun.Some groups, noticeably Estee Lauder in cosmetics and Heineken in beverages, are bucking the trend and experiencing robust growth. Jamie Isenwater, founding partner of Ash Park Capital, a fund dedicated to consumer staples, says the industry is no more vulnerable to disruption than others.“One of the many reasons why consumer staples have made such excellent long-term investments is that people will always need to eat, drink, clean and take care of their appearance. A lot of the talk about disruption as a major threat is overdone and much of the competitive activity that is being referred to is completely normal.”Nevertheless, Mr Isenwater believes that some companies do have problems — US food groups in particular. “Five years ago, you could have thrown darts into a board of consumer staples investments and your performance would have been very good. That’s no longer the case — you have to be more selective about where you invest. But companies in the top quartile will deliver exactly the same sort of returns as before,” he says.For now, the big companies are paying close attention to their upstart rivals. Mr Hall says Sipsmith will be able to expand into other countries far more quickly than if it had stayed independent. “We will continue to run the business in the way we started. We’ve grown immensely but we’re tiny on the global scale.”"
69;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-02-27T19:12:29Z;Unilever chief admits Kraft Heinz bid forced compromises;Focus on maximising shareholder return ‘distracts companies’, says Paul Polman;Unilever’s chief executive has expressed regret over steps the company took last year to woo shareholders in the wake of Kraft Heinz’s unsolicited $143bn takeover approach, as he urged investors to rethink their short-term focus on maximising shareholder value.“We had to make some practical compromises . . . which I frankly would not have done,” Paul Polman told a New York conference of chief executives and institutional investors organised by the CECP: The CEO Force for Good on Monday. “You’d be daft if you don’t ask [us] to invest in our company but we did a €5bn share buyback to satisfy some others.”Unilever in April announced the buyback alongside a 12 per cent increase in its dividend and a doubling of planned cost cuts to €2bn by 2020, resulting in a 20 per cent operating profit margin by the same year.“We were well on track to do that but I would never have put the margin out there. I come from a part of [the Netherlands] that we deliver. We just deliver and let the numbers talk, but unfortunately that’s not possible for the majority of how the financial markets still operate,” Mr Polman said.Investors’ focus on maximising shareholder value was “distracting many companies from doing what they should be doing” to innovate, invest, renew their strategies and take care of all their stakeholders, he said.If business cannot show what positive impact it has, why should the citizens of the world let business be around?Without naming Kraft Heinz, the food group backed by Warren Buffett and the Brazilian billionaires behind 3G Capital, Mr Polman described the failed bid attempt as “a clash between people who think about billions of people in the world and some people that think about a few billionaires”.Speaking to portfolio managers representing an estimated $25tn of assets under management, Mr Polman told them to stop asking companies like his why they heeded environmental, social and governance concerns and start pressing those that did not do so to explain “why [they] have the courage to destroy . . . this wonderful planet”.Investors with a responsibility to generate long-term returns to match their pension liabilities had the same responsibility to ensure that their members “are retiring in a world they can live in”, he said, urging industry leaders such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink to integrate teams working on governance and sustainability with the people making investment decisions.Mr Polman, a vocal advocate for long-term capitalism and for companies’ social responsibilities, also rebuked financial analysts for not asking him a single question about climate change, diversity or human rights over a decade of earnings calls.“I don’t get it,” he said: “If business cannot show what positive impact it has, why should the citizens of the world let business be around?”Mr Polman also singled out the gig economy, saying Unilever had stopped using Deliveroo, the food delivery company, in London.His son had worked for Deliveroo, he said, “but you get one traffic ticket and it wipes out the earnings of the whole day”.“These people are out there on less than a London living wage per hour, trying to get killed in traffic. So I don’t want my ice creams to be delivered by that because I don’t want my children to do that either.”Asked whether Unilever had decided whether to relocate its headquarters from London, Mr Polman declined to comment.
70;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Warren Buffett to step down from Kraft Heinz board;Move comes as legendary investor reduces travel commitments;Kraft Heinz on Friday said Warren Buffett will retire from the food and beverage company’s board as the legendary investor is decreasing his travel commitments.Mr Buffett will step down following the end of his term at the upcoming annual shareholders meeting in April. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, is the largest shareholder in the company with a 26.7 per cent stake.“It has been an honour to work with Warren for the past five years,” said Alex Behring, chairman of the board. “His many invaluable contributions to Kraft Heinz will have a lasting impact on the Company for years to come. The Board of Directors looks forward to his continued partnership as Chairman of our largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway.”The move comes ahead of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. Mr Buffett, 87, last month promoted his top two lieutenants Greg Abel, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Ajit Jain, the Omaha-based group’s reinsurance chief, to vice-chairman roles — a decision that was viewed as part of a step towards a succession plan.Kraft Heinz was created in 2015 through a $100bn deal orchestrated by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital. Mr Buffett and 3G had acquired Heinz for $28bn in 2013. Following the merger in 2015, 49 per cent of the next group was handed to Kraft shareholders along with a $10bn special dividend, while Mr Buffett and 3G retained 51 per cent of the new group.The company behind Jell-O and Heinz ketchup said it will nominate Alexandre Van Damme, a board member of Anheuser-Busch InBev, to stand for election in Mr Buffett’s stead.Kraft Heinz said organic sales fell 0.6 per cent in the most recent quarter as demand weakened in the US, the company’s largest market. However, the company, which had its bid rebuffed by Unilever last year has recently signalled its appetitie for more deals.Chief executive Bernardo Hees said earlier this month that changes in the industry will “increase the pressure for further consolidation” adding that “with our global presence and financial strength, I think that we’ll continue to generate opportunities for us to expand our portfolio, and our company”.Kraft Heinz shares, which are down 11 per cent year-to-date, were little changed in after-hours trade.
71;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-02-21T04:00:33Z;How and when zero-based budgeting boosts corporate productivity;Radical approach to cutting costs for business must be sustainable in order to work;Resetting the dials to nought is one way of signalling radicalism. French revolutionaries and the Khmer Rouge embraced a Year One and a Year Zero, respectively. Given the sanguinary consequences, middle managers confronted with the trend for zero-based budgeting (ZBB) are right to feel nervous. There may be blood on the carpet, if only of the metaphorical kind.ZBB requires every item within a business and its sub-units to be justified anew within any budgetary period. It can be a scary concept. If a tea trolley has brought round cakes and hot drinks every week since 1983, that does not mean you still need it this week.In its most aggressive form, as practised by some private equity groups, ZBB can make a business feel as if it is experiencing a permanent revolution. The aim here is financial rather than ideological, in the shape of an exit that enriches the owners. This can leave an under-invested business tottering towards disaster.If you work at a company where worn carpet tiles are replaced singly and low mileage allowances require staff to subsidise their own sales jaunts, you may be experiencing this strategy in practice.Productivity gains are more likely when divisional bosses are given tough targets and left to get on with itZBB has been around since the 1960s, when it was developed by Peter Pyhrr, an accountant at Texas Instruments. Its current prominence — not to say notoriety — is thanks largely to its use by Brazilian investor-led buyout group 3G, when combining HJ Heinz and Kraft Foods in 2015. Margins at the combined food group improved markedly.Last year, Kraft Heinz made a bid approach to Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever. This collapsed when Unilever demurred, because the backers included Berkshire Hathaway, which avoids hostile takeovers. However, Unilever was sufficiently rattled to raise margin targets and talk up its enthusiasm for ZBB.The profitability of the company, which has pursued social aims as enthusiastically as capitalist ones, has historically lagged behind those of rivals with fiercer internal cost-cutting cultures, such as Reckitt Benckiser.Sir Martin Sorrell, veteran chief executive of marketing giant WPP, recently included ZBB in a list of factors curbing client spending. It is no coincidence that ZBB is popular in mature industries. Brewing giant AB InBev, whose investors include founding partners of 3G, also practises it.In mature sectors, profits tend to rise only in line with gross domestic product. Here, technology will be long-established and widely held, and market share hard to win. Productivity rises can then only come from marginal gains in efficiency. The cyclist who shaves his legs in hopes of making a tiny improvement in lap times is engaged in the same quest.More pertinently, perhaps, ZBB has something in common with lean manufacturing. This production philosophy, formalised as the Toyota Production System in Japan and Six Sigma in the US, focuses on eliminating waste within a factory by subordinating all parts of the supply chain to production.That might sound boring. Lean manufacturing however has the ability to revivify the culture of sluggish businesses by pushing elements of decision-making down into production units. Workers who deal every day with the minutiae of production often know better how to improve it than bosses who never get their hands dirty.Lean manufacturing and ZBB require adherents to approach spending and manufacturing with fresh eyes. Factories can accumulate wasteful processes — an indirect route for a delivery robot avoiding an assembly line that has since moved elsewhere, for example. Equally, a consumer goods business may no longer need baseline advertising spending of $10m a year in Chicago newspapers if the readership of the latter has collapsed.I recently dropped in on a chief executive who over the past four years has turned round the fortunes of a listed multinational. The next stage, he said, was to implement ZBB.Is that not the accounting equivalent of a scorched earth policy, I asked.His reply: it depends how you go about it. ZBB imposed by the centre might well feel like that. Used as a financial discipline within satellite businesses, he believes it will increase autonomy.Chief executives and finance directors who micromanage divisional budgets are doomed to failure by their lack of detailed knowledge. Productivity gains are more likely when divisional bosses are given tough targets and left to get on with it.It ain’t what you do, it’s the way that you do it. Pursued in the same spirit as lean manufacturing, zero-based budgeting makes a lot of sense. If it is merely a stick with which to beat local managers and workers, short-term improvements in margins will damage shareholders’ equity in the longer term.The writer is head of the Lex columnThis article has been changed to correct the description of AB InBev
72;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-02-16T18:36:46Z;Food industry giants struggle to keep up with changing tastes;Sales woes at Kraft Heinz, Danone and others force groups to cut costs and eye deals;Makers of sugary drinks and processed foods are struggling to boost sales to increasingly health-conscious and penny-pinching consumers, forcing them to slash costs to beef up bottom lines and look for deals to stimulate growth.The challenges were laid bare on Friday as industry giants Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola and Danone revealed fourth-quarter results that showed shoppers turning away from products that delighted earlier generations — from processed cheese slices to cola cans loaded with 39 grams of sugar — in favour of cheaper store brands or healthier offerings.“There is no question that our financial performance in 2017 did not reflect our potential,” Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz, said as weak demand for meats and cheese sent US sales down 1.1 per cent, the seventh straight quarterly drop.The changes in tastes have forced the world’s biggest food and drinks companies to shift towards newer products favoured by younger consumers.Coca-Cola, which reported soft drink sales at a 31-year low, still was able to post a 6 per cent rise in organic sales — nearly double analyst forecasts — with help from vitamin water, tea products and other drinks it has added to its offerings, often through acquisitions.Mr Hees of Kraft Heinz hinted its major shareholder — 3G, the acquisitive private equity group — might return to dealmaking following a more than 20 per cent decline in the company’s share price, which hit a two-year low last week.“It’s fair to say that valuations today are more attractive today than they were even two months ago, and the chapter of Kraft Heinz integration is behind us,” he said. If there is more consolidation in the industry, he added: “We want to be a force of that.”Since the $100bn merger of Kraft Heinz, 3G has followed its playbook of cutting costs to drive up profits. Gross profit margins have soared to 37 per cent, from 27 per cent when the company was formed in 2015. The company on Thursday said it had met its target of reducing costs by $1.7bn by the end of last year. Net income rose to $8bn, or $6.52 a share, reflecting a benefit from the US tax overhaul.Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest fizzy drinks company, aims to save $3bn by next year as part of a cost-cutting plan. It reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share in the fourth quarter, just above the 38 cents analysts expected.Other food and beverage companies fared worse. Campbell Soup reported organic sales fell 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, weighed by weak demand for its trademark soups in North America. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food group, on Thursday revealed that last year’s sales grew at their slowest rate in more than two decades. On Friday Danone, the French yoghurt and water company, said like-for-like sales grew 2.5 per cent in 2017, the slowest pace in 20 years.* Analysts have suggested that consolidation is inevitable this year as the incumbents battle for sales. “Long-term headwinds reinforce the need to diversify outside of US food and we continue to see upside from potential large-scale M&A,” said analysts at RBC, raising a tie-up between Kraft Heinz and Mondelez as a potential option.Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the move away from packaged food superbrands is here to stay. “There was a pattern we saw through the whole of 2017 with the entire food and beverage sector,” he said. “The entire industry . . . has been a little slow to recognise it, but we have it firmly in our sights now.”*This story has been updated with 2017 figures
73;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-02-16T13:02:14Z;Kraft Heinz sales miss on weak US demand;Sales drop 1.1 per cent in the company’s largest market;Kraft Heinz, the company behind Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, on Friday reported a decrease in fourth quarter organic sales as demand weakened in the US.Net sales edged up 0.3 per cent from a year ago to $6.88bn, a shade below analysts’ estimates and including a 0.9 percentage point benefit from currency moves. But stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations and other items, organic sales fell 0.6 per cent compared to a year ago in the fourth quarter.Organic sales were down 1.1 per cent in the US, the company’s largest market, where prices increased but the company saw lower shipments across several categories including nuts, natural cheese and cold cuts in the United States, which was partially offset by growth in macaroni cheese.Meanwhile, organic sales fell 8.6 per cent in Canada and were up 0.9 per cent in Europe and 7 per cent in the rest of the world, driven by strong growth in China and Indonesia.“There’s no question that our financial performance in 2017 did not reflect our progress or potential,” said Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees. “We made significant improvements in many of our businesses, and were able to accelerate some important business investments at the end of the year. This, together with benefits from the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and additional investments in our capabilities, should help further advantage our brands and grow our business in 2018 and beyond.”Net income rose to $8bn or $6.52 a share reflecting a benefit from the US tax overhaul. Adjusted earnings fell 1.1 per cent to 90 cents a share and missed analysts’ estimates of 95 cents.The company, which was created in 2015 through a $100bn deal devised by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital, on Thursday hinted at plans that it could be open to more M&A as Mr Hees said in an investor presentation that changes in the industry will increase pressure for further consolidation and “we will continue to generate opportunities for us to expand our portfolio”.The company also said it had met its target of reducing costs by $1.7bn by the end of last year.Kraft Heinz shares, which are down 6.5 per cent year-to-date, were down 0.3 per cent pre-market.
74;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2018-01-09T04:00:29Z;Are Big Brands the next market bubble?;Investors may find their assumptions about consumer packaged goods companies prove costly;The credit crisis taught an entire generation that catastrophes can explode out of the most obscure corners of financial markets.Analysts who had lived their professional lives without having to think about the alphabet soup of esoteric structured credit were shocked to see these instruments send tremors through the global financial system.Since 2008 we have been conditioned to fetishise the complex and obscure when thinking about financial risks. Dangers lurk in the shadows rather than stare us in the face.But could it be that today the very things the market judges as the most boring and dependable of them all will pose the greatest threat to investors’ wealth over the next decade? A longstanding and unchallenged assumption held by many is that Big Brand consumer goods companies are extremely safe and solid bets.Since the days of Warren Buffett’s famed acquisition of See’s Candy, a company purchased for $25m in the 1970s that now makes more than $80m year in profits, there has been a growing consensus over the “economic moats” consumer goods businesses can enjoy as a result of their strong brands.In the stock market rally since the financial crisis, shares in large consumer packaged goods companies (CPGs) have been driven to ever more optimistic valuations. Several factors are at work.Yield-hungry investors have prized these shares for their dividends and apparent stability. The market has also priced in an assumption that some of these companies have a significant potential for growth in emerging markets, easily offsetting any sales slowdown in mature economies.Lastly there has been what can be dubbed a “3G premium” baked into their valuations, based on the stalking presence of the Brazilian private equity group in the market famed for slashing costs and lifting margins at the companies they take control of.This prevailing consensus has pushed these shares to ever higher levels at precisely the time when there are multiple signs of emerging competitive threats that threaten the “moats” these companies have enjoyed for so long.Django Davidson, founding partner of the fund manager Hosking Partners, last year noted how a number of Big Brand companies were being priced at ever loftier valuations in spite of their sales actually slowing.“The CPG-as-moat is essentially dated,” he wrote in a presentation entitled ‘The Death of the Brand’. “A mental model that worked well in the post-WWII era is unlikely to produce similar results in the coming decades . . . a little guy can buy a part of it. The barriers to entry in advertising — the ‘moat’ — have collapsed.”This is worrying for what he calls “supposedly ‘bond like’ long-duration equities”. Product development, distribution and marketing are no longer dominated by multinational companies. Incumbents are being forced to buy challenger brands at high and dilutive multiples.Sales at Kraft Heinz, controlled by 3G and part-owned by Buffett, have fallen each quarter from the start of 2015 to the middle of last year, while at Mondelez, whose brands include Oreo and Cadbury, revenues have also dropped over this period. At the same time both companies’ valuations on an enterprise value to sales basis have risen sharply.What is even more striking is that executives at consumer companies are publicly admitting that they are facing growing disruption, yet equity investors appear to be barely discounting this in their valuations.Jorge Mesquita, chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer division, last year noted how barriers to entry in the form of access to manufacturing, logistics and marketing were coming down across the world. In the “last few decades in this industry,” he said, “there were a series of barriers for entry or sources of competitive advantage that were well established but those are becoming less and less unique.”“You see a new class of competitors emerging and now we have our classic multinational, well-established competitors and you have these new entrants to contend with.”In spite of this, the market today believes that CPGs will be able to increase their sales and profits while enjoying higher profit margins in perpetuity.Their current valuations provide no room for error in this assumption, meaning even a small readjustment of expectations will have brutal consequences for their optimistic investors.As Mr Davidson notes, anyone who bought shares in Coca-Cola in 1998 had to wait 18 years for them to return to where they started, even as its annual sales doubled over this time.For investors buying into Big Brand companies today under the justification of an infinitely rosy future the outcome could be even more painful.miles.johnson@ft.com
75;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-12-03T17:00:26Z;Paul Polman: how I fended off a hostile takeover bid;The Unilever chief foiled the advances of Kraft Heinz and 3G Capital;"Paul Polman wanted to be a priest, then a doctor. His fallback was business, where his drive and determination have taken him to the top. He is now running Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group.The multinational — which produces household brands including Sunsilk shampoo, Axe deodorants, Persil laundry tablets and Magnum ice cream — generates about €50bn a year in revenues and reaches 2.5bn people a day.How does he lead? For a moment, the 61-year-old Dutchman professes to be uncomfortable. This sits oddly with the same chief executive who this year fought off a $143bn hostile bid from Kraft Heinz of the US, with a counter-attack that galvanised everyone from investors to Bono, the U2 frontman.Since he took the helm nine years ago, Mr Polman, an earnest man who speaks in torrents of words, has waged a public campaign for CEOs and shareholders to improve people’s lives by providing employment and sustainable manufacturing. By eroding poverty, wealth creates consumers, which is convenient. But in Mr Polman’s world view the two can be combined, as at Unilever’s origins in the 1880s when William Hesketh Lever established a soap manufacturer with a social mission.“The [purpose] of Lord Lever when he made his Sunlight bar soap, was to address the issues of hygiene in Victorian Britain,” he says. “The reason I believe business should be around is to serve society.”Mr Polman’s aim soon after he took over in 2009 was to double the company’s revenues while halving its environmental impact. Though the hunt for his successor has begun, he intends to remain in post throughout 2018.He may not be a clergyman, but his tendency to preach makes him the capitalist with a moral compass. Mr Polman knows his style — sometimes hectoring — can annoy people. But he cannot resist trying to convert them.“You have to watch it that you don’t steamroller people,” he acknowledges. Unless you persuade the people under you to follow you, there is no point in being a leader. His father used to say: “If you want a lot of people under you, you could be a tender in a graveyard.”His biggest leadership moment came in February, when Kraft Heinz, the US food group, made a play for Unilever — a daring move that came out of the blue. Kraft Heinz is controlled by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investment group, and Brazilian investor-led 3G Capital, the private equity group, which has elevated serial dealmaking and ferocious cost-cutting to a fine art.Mr Polman finds it hard to contain his disdain for the 3G Capital way of doing business, tending to refer to the group as “these people”. “No question that any bank is just drooling over these people to give them $50bn, $60bn. No question that the financial market allows you to leverage up your balance sheet five, six times,” he complains.The approach became public on the FT’s Alphaville site on a Friday morning. By Sunday evening, the bid was dead. It was an unusual public defeat for 3G. How did Mr Polman achieve it? “We have a board that is very supportive and understands our business model.” Chaired by Marijn Dekkers, former CEO of Germany’s Bayer pharmaceutical group, the board dismissed the offer as too low and making no strategic sense.The many people who are driven by a strong purpose to truly dedicating their lives to others, often at the expense of their own—– doctors fighting Ebola in east Africa, or those working with deaf and blind people are good examples.CEO is just a title and irrelevant. I would look for where I could make the biggest contribution to drive more sustainable and equitable growth.The first lesson comes on the day you are born and breathing on your own — that you are dependent on the environment you live in. The most useful lesson comes when you realise that it’s not about yourself, but putting yourself to the service of others.In Mr Polman’s words, the bid was “clearly a clash between a long-term, sustainable business model for multiple stakeholders and a model that is entirely focused on shareholder primacy.” Mr Polman and finance director, Graeme Pitkethly, set up a sub-group to move quickly and reply to Kraft Heinz. “We made very clear that we were not interested. They didn’t hear us for some reason. We sent letters. They didn’t read them for some reason.”Advisers were hired. “You get 20 lawyers around you and 50 bankers, and basically the lawyers all tell you what you cannot do. They never tell you what you can do. And the last thing you want to hear is what you cannot do.”Mr Polman knew that, without decisive action, activist investors could pile into Unilever on the Monday, giving succour to Kraft Heinz — “these people have a history of not giving up”.The reason I believe business should be around, is to serve societyNeither the UK nor the Dutch governments played much of a role. “It was the weekend; [the bid] was public on Friday and stopped on Sunday. That’s not exactly the speed with which governments work,” he says.It then became apparent to Mr Polman that Mr Buffett did not seem aware that the offer would have to go hostile to succeed — the Sage of Omaha has always publicly opposed hostile takeovers.“Unknown to us at that time, Warren wasn’t actively involved. With the confidence he has, probably, in those people, he had delegated [the bid] to these people — that would be my best interpretation,” says Mr Polman.Mr Buffett was duly bombarded. “Warren was approached by probably more people than he expected,” says Mr Polman, declining to say who did so. “As soon as Warren discovered that this was a hostile takeover, the tone of the conversation became different.”In its statement “amicably” agreeing to desist, Kraft Heinz said it had “the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever”.Even if the bid had not been killed off, Mr Polman is convinced it would have faced huge opposition from Unilever’s supporters among charity workers, unions and shareholders. A YouGov petition with 100,000 signatories was ready. Bono, the rock singer and campaigner, had already called Mr Polman offering to write a song, he says.With hindsight, Mr Polman says the Kraft Heinz bid may have been averted if he had communicated Unilever’s financial targets better. He says he was “very conservative” in the investor seminar of November 2016, which suggests he could have gone further. After the bid he raised Unilever’s profit margin target from 16 per cent to 20 per cent by 2020, launching a €5bn buyback and increasing the dividend, which contributed to a rise in the share price.But the tension between balancing short-term investor expectations and the longer-term has not gone away. Nor have demands on his time. His biggest weakness is an inability to turn down worthwhile projects — that day, he met President Santos of Colombia to talk about investing in former Farc-controlled regions.“When there are so many issues that need to be addressed, and when you are in a position to do something about that, I feel that sense of duty.”Portrait by Charlie BibbyAny well-run publicly listed organisation should be prepared to see off a hostile takeover, with defence plans in place ready to activate quickly, writes Professor Scott Moeller, director of the M&A Research Centre at Cass Business School.The obvious advice is to implement those plans immediately. But because hostile takeovers are rare (less than 3 per cent of public target offers are hostile, according to Mergermarket), companies often have no plans ready. Many may think, somewhat hubristically, “it won’t happen to me”.But then it happens. And what if the hostile bidder also makes its offer public? Your shareholders will demand a statement — and guidance — from you.“I would try to gain back some control of the situation by assembling quickly a team that includes the board, specialist hostile defence advisers (investment banker, lawyer and PR) and key senior executives,” says Prof Moeller. “Then communicate your defence externally. Fast.”"

Organic net sales rose 0.3 per cent from the same time a year ago.Shares fell 2.8 per cent in extended trading.Kraft, like peers across the globe, is trying to adapt to a different kind of consumer that is prioritising health and convenience when buying food.The company, which was created in 2015 through a $100bn deal devised by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital, has been cutting costs to drive earnings growth. Kraft Heinz on Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates of 82 cents a share. The company is targeting $1.7bn in annual cost savings by next year.Chief executive Bernardo Hees said: “There’s no question that the retail environment, particularly in the United States, will remain both dynamic and challenging. However, the investments we’ve been making in our brands, our innovation pipeline, our people and our capabilities make us well-positioned to continue delivering sustainable, profitable growth in both the near and long term.”Shares in Kraft Heinz have dropped more than 11 per cent this year, after a failed attempt to buy Unilever for $143bn in February.
77;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-10-24T19:38:48Z;Private-equity groups advance in $7bn auction for Unilever spreads business;;A handful of private-equity groups have advanced to the second round of bidding in a contested $7bn auction for Unilever’s spreads business.According to multiple people informed on the situation, Apollo Global Management and KKR have made it through to the second round.A consortium including Bain Capital is also thought to have advanced in the auction.Private-equity groups made up the bulk of interested parties in the bidding for the spreads business, which includes brands like Flora and has fallen out of favour at Unilever as consumers opt for more natural food products.Blackstone and CVC, which were also bidding for the unit of Unilever, are out of the race, the people said. KKR had been looking to bid with Singapore’s GIC.Unilever has asked for interested buyers for the entire unit, which is spread over 60 countries, and for regional packages. The Anglo-Dutch group put the business up for sale this year as part of a series of promises to investors to boost its performance after the failed $143bn bid from Kraft Heinz left it looking vulnerable.Unilever declined to comment. Bidders who did not make through to the second round are not prohibited from making a fresh bid, one person added. Unilever is also holding out the possibility that it could opt for a public offering of the spreads business if it believes it can get a higher price.Private equity firms are particularly keen on buying units from large corporations because they believe they can run businesses more efficiently, cut costs where needed and add new geographies to seek growth.AkzoNobel has also put its specialty chemicals unit up for sale, and Sanofi is selling a drug unit. Both auctions have attracted interest from private equity.

Sales in emerging markets – where Unilever makes 57 per cent of its revenues – rose by 6.3 per cent, but fell by 2.3 per cent in developed markets.The group stuck to its its full year outlook of 3-5 per cent organic growth target.Paul Polman, chief executive said:While conditions in our developed markets remain challenging, we are starting to see signs of improvement in some of our biggest emerging markets including India and China. Growth in the third quarter was adversely affected by poorer weather in Europe compared with last year and natural disasters in the Americas.The shares have risen by 32 per cent in the year to date, in the wake of the Kraft Heinz bid and after the company promised €6bn of savings to boost profit margins from last year’s 16 per cent to 20 per cent by 2020, and a €5bn share buyback.The deadline for the first round of bids for its spreads business – mainly margarines such as Flora/Becel – is due today.

79;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-10-11T08:11:52Z;Unilever moves to simplify corporate structure after failed bid by Kraft Heinz;;Unilever on Wednesday launched the €450m buyback of its Dutch preference shares in a move that simplifies the Anglo-Dutch company’s capital structure, paving the way for it to potentially become a single corporation that could make it easier to pursue large M&A.The producer of Dove soap, Axe deodorants and Hellmann’s mayonnaise said in August that it would acquire its Dutch preference shares through a buyback and public offer. The offer, which began on Wednesday, ends on October 25.The corporate tidy-up has long been mooted – Unilever has been discussing it at its Dutch annual meetings for a decade – but was given added impetus after the failed and unwanted $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz in February.In April, Unilever said it would review its dual-headed corporate structure, making no secret of the merits of a simplified structure that would enable it to be more agile, especially in large-ticket M&A involving shares but also in the case of a demerger of a business.A demerger of the spreads business – mainly margarine such as Flora/Becel and I Can’t Believe it’s not Butter – is an option in the event of an adequate price failing to emerge.Unilever is holding an auction for spreads with first-rounds bids due in next week and interest from private equity groups has been high. It has already sold off the spreads unit in South Africa.In August the group said it had agreed terms with NN Investment Partners and ASR Nederland for the acquisition of their 6 per cent and 7 per cent cumulative preference shares in Unilever NV, the company’s Dutch-listed entity, representing 97 per cent of such preference shares. The public offer is to enable remaining holders to sell their preference shares on the same terms.These preference shares were issued between 1927 and 1964 and carry a higher nominal value and greater voting rights than ordinary shares.

Since then, its shares have surged more than 600 per cent.“There is no doubt that the Weight Watchers long-term collaboration with Oprah Winfrey has certainly accelerated the company’s progress since October 2015, with high awareness of her success and happiness with the programme sparking interest and excitement,” chief executive Mindy Grossman said earlier this month.Ms Winfrey isn’t a shareholder in Kraft Heinz. The company’s shares were little changed on Wednesday.

Utility, industrial and technology groups helped to offset declines in the energy, basic materials, telecom and consumer industries.While only the Dow set new closing highs this week among the three big US indices, a solid earnings season has helped both the Nasdaq and S&P churn near record territory.“The combination of planned tax cuts, both corporate and personal, light-handed regulation, a repatriation tax holiday on overseas cash and possible infrastructure spending has buoyed hopes for faster economic activity in [the] second half of 2017 into 2018,” said Tobias Levkovich, a strategist with Citi. “However, earnings have been more crucial for stock prices.”Earnings for S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results, coupled with Wall Street estimates for those that have yet to release figures, are projected to rise by a combined 10.1 per cent in the second quarter, up from an estimate for 6.4 per cent at the end of June, according to FactSet.Kraft Heinz was among the companies on the S&P 500 that reported better than expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, and its shares opened more than 1 per cent higher on Friday. The stock ultimately lost momentum and ended the day up 0.2 per cent at $86.66.Shares of L Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, La Senza and Bath & Body Works, climbed 4.1 per cent to $43.30 on Friday after the company said it expected second-quarter earnings to be in the high end of its forecast of 40 to 45 cents a share. Wall Street analysts had projected earnings of 42 cents per share.“We like the improvement in Victoria’s Secret comp and merchandise margin and expect same-store sales to continue to improve,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “We believe L Brands’ solid brands continue to resonate well with consumers.”Outside of the S&P 500, shares in Weight Watchers surged 25.1 per cent to $41.39, their biggest one-day gain since March, after the purveyor of weight-loss advice lifted its full-year earnings outlook.The company said it saw “strong recruitment growth” and “marginal improvement” in retaining existing members as its partnership with Oprah Winfrey continues to spark “excitement”.

Sales fell to $6.67bn, from $6.79bn a year ago in the three months to the end of June. Wall Street had forecast sales of $6.73bn.Organic net sales fell 0.9 percent versus the year-ago period.Across the industry, consumer goods giants have seen sales hit amid a pivot to healthier foods. Kraft has made moves to adapt, removing artificial colours from its namesake packaged macaroni and cheese.Chief executive Bernardo Hees said the results were “as expected…better than our first quarter,” adding that he expects “momentum to continue into the second half of the year”.Sales in the US, its biggest market, fell 1.2 per cent to $4.6n.Kraft Heinz –which came together in a $100bn deal devised by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital in 2015 — has been cutting costs to offset sliding sales. It aims to cut costs by $1.7bn annually by 2018.Two years on from the Kraft-Heinz megamerger, analysts have speculated over the next target on 3G’s shopping list, pointing to Mondelez and General Mills as candidates. Shares in Kraft Heinz have fallen about five per cent since a failed attempt to buy Unilever for $143bn in February.* Article amended from original publication to reflect a bigger-then-expected drop in sales.
83;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

New orders for manufactured goods jumped 3 per cent, its biggest gain in eight months, according to data from the US Commerce Department.Growth in durable goods orders – which are seen as a proxy for business investment – also held steady, rising 6.4 per cent in June compared to the 6.5 per cent pace logged in May.The relatively robust snapshots of the US manufacturing sector were tempered however by a separate report showing that the rate of expansion in the vast US services sector slowed to its weakest level in 11 months.The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing gauge clocked in at 53.9 in July. While the figure is above the 50 line that separates expansion from contraction, it came in well short of Wall Street expectations of 56.9 and below the 57.4 reading logged in June.Looking ahead, Kraft Heinz, Viacom, Shake Shake and Yelp will be releasing quarterly results after the market close.
85;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-08-03T11:48:09Z;Chief’s exit fuels talk Mondelez could be back in play;Rosenfeld argues the US snacks group should stay independent;"As Irene Rosenfeld prepares to leave after 11 years as chief executive of Mondelez International, investors are wondering whether history will repeat itself with the company being put back in play now that a chief resistant to activist pressure is heading for the exit.In 2014, just three months after Tony Vernon left the top job at Kraft Foods, which split from Mondelez, the group agreed a $100bn merger with rival Heinz. The deal, after years of rebuffs to activists, came when Mr Vernon’s successor, John Cahill, welcomed an approach by 3G, the Brazilian investment group that has reshaped the food industry. “People are drawing the obvious parallel to [Vernon],” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein. “The consumer industry is under a lot of pressure right now . . . if you don’t produce good results, you’re on your way out.”Ms Rosenfeld has steered Mondelez through a seismic shift in the food industry over the past decade and is known for making bold bets. The former basketball player and psychology graduate joined Kraft as chief executive in 2006 and quickly sought to “rewire” the company. She aimed to revive stagnant brands, increasing the cheese content of Kraft macaroni and cheese, and unveiling new spins on company stalwarts, such as Oreo’s “cakesters”.Ms Rosenfeld said: “We were clear about what the outcome needed to be and we did not waver from that. That really is the key to my ability to make some of the bold decisions that were critical to creating this company.”Our plan was always to stay the courseIn the UK, however, she was the focus of outrage over the hostile takeover of chocolate maker Cadbury in 2010. After the deal’s completion, Kraft quickly closed a Cadbury factory despite promising not to during the bid process, triggering an outcry that prompted a rethink on regulations covering foreign takeovers of British companies. Ms Rosenfeld angered critics further by repeatedly snubbing parliamentary hearings probing the deal.Her biggest bet was splitting Kraft’s grocery arm from its faster-growing snacks unit, Mondelez, in 2012. Since then Ms Rosenfeld has eschewed big deals, instead slashing costs. “As I look at the industry now, I don’t think as much about consolidation as I do about the sea change that we’re seeing in consumer behaviour and the customer profile,” she said. Ms Rosenfeld argues that Mondelez should stay independent despite years of pressure from activists, including US investors Nelson Peltz and Bill Ackman. “The world has certainly evolved . . . but I don’t think the rationale for why [Mondelez] is better as an independent business has changed much,” she said. “Our plan was always to stay the course,” she added, noting that the company has delivered $120bn to shareholders thanks to a rising stock price and dividend payouts. Investors appear to disagree: lingering speculation that Mondelez, the third-largest packaged food and confectionery company after Nestlé and PepsiCo, will be the next on 3G’s shopping list has propped up the stock. Mondelez shares have been roughly flat over the past two years despite shrinking sales, as it struggles with slow growth and cash-strapped but more health-conscious consumers. Since the split from Kraft, sales at Mondelez have declined steadily, from $35.3bn in net revenues in 2013 to $25.9bn last year. Mondelez last year made an unsuccessful $23bn bid for Hershey in a move that was viewed by some analysts as a defensive act against the company itself being targeted.“The question now is whether Mondelez changes strategy significantly, particularly through acquisitions,” said Gaurav Gupta, principal at Kotter International and a former consultant to Hershey. “Other than the play for Hershey, they’ve been fairly quiet.”The question is whether the $70bn snack juggernaut becomes predator or prey in a fresh wave of consolidation expected this year. ————————-1.

6. August 2016: Mondelez gives up its pursuit of Hershey, after the chocolate maker rejects a $23bn bid————————–Similar to other sprawling empires in the packaged food industry, Mondelez has come under pressure from investors in recent years. Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square bought a $5.5bn stake in the company in 2015, while Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, which has waged activist campaigns at consumer groups from PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble, has about 44m shares in Mondelez.Ms Rosenfeld’s history with Mr Peltz dates to 2007, when Trian, a Kraft shareholder, pressured her to sell underperforming cereal brands. He later pressed her to split Kraft, and has also proposed merging Mondelez with PepsiCo. Mr Peltz won a seat on Mondelez’s board in 2014, and a month later the company announced a push for cost cuts through so-called zero-based budgeting, a strategy pursued aggressively by 3G. Mondelez seems to be top of the list of potential targets for Kraft Heinz among investors, which could provide near-term support [for the stock]Looking to convince investors that Mondelez could operate as efficiently as 3G’s Kraft Heinz, Ms Rosenfeld pledged to increase operating margins to between 17 per cent and 18 per cent by 2018. After 3G, with Warren Buffett, bought Heinz in 2013, the ketchup maker’s profit margins soared 58 per cent within two years to 28 per cent. Mondelez reported an operating margin of 16 per cent in its latest results this week. Mr Peltz, who has flagged concerns about Mondelez in recent years, once complaining that the company’s name “sounds like a disease”, praised Ms Rosenfeld this week: “Her leadership has benefited all of the company’s stakeholders,” he said. Analysts at JPMorgan say the leadership change signals that Mondelez will not be sold in the near future, while Mr Gupta does not believe Ms Rosenfeld’s retirement will affect the probability “too much”. “Mondelez seems to be top of the list of potential targets for Kraft Heinz among investors, which could provide near-term support” to its stock price, said Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein. Ms Rosenfeld, who has been one of the most prominent female executives in corporate America, says she will “spend a lot of time thinking about what to do next”. However, she added: “I can say with reasonable confidence I will probably not be sitting on a beach.”After a long selection process, Mondelez has chosen a little-known outsider to steer the company through the next phase of its turnround.“I’m sure you’ve seen our press releases and you’re all googling furiously,” Irene Rosenfeld quipped on Wednesday, after the company announced that Dirk Van de Put, the chief executive of McCain, a private, family-owned Canadian maker of frozen french fries, would succeed her to head Mondelez.Mr Van de Put has worked in the consumer goods sector for more than three decades, holding executive posts at big names such as Coca-Cola and Mars. Ms Rosenfeld told investors Mr Van de Put was “ambidextrous”, with a record of “walking and chewing gum” at the same time, referencing his commitment to both top line and bottom line growth. He was the “unanimous choice”, she said.During his six-year tenure as chief of McCain, net sales increased more than 50 per cent, generating more than 75 per cent of that growth organically, Mondelez said. “The message is he is a growth guru,” said Alexia Howard, analyst at Bernstein.Others speculate about whether Mr Van de Put might drive dealmaking, after Ms Rosenfeld failed to buy Hershey last year. Under his watch, McCain in recent years sold its North American frozen pizza business and bought majority stakes in companies such as Lutosa, the Belgian potato processor, and Van Geloven, the Dutch frozen food company.“Judging by his background, having done acquisitions with McCain, I would imagine that’s why they brought him in,” Mr Gupta said. “I’d be surprised if [deals] are not part of the plan."
86;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-07-21T04:02:54Z;Consumer goods make appetising target for US activists;Nestlé, P&G and Unilever all under pressure to improve performance;Nelson Peltz has always had a healthy appetite for food. Heinz, Cadbury, Mondelez, PepsiCo and Danone — the veteran US activist investor has agitated for change in them all.Mr Peltz’s taste have broadened with his ambitions. This week, the 75-year old launched a proxy battle to get a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble, the US’s biggest household products company with a $226bn market value, in which Mr Peltz’s Trian investment group invested $3.3bn this year.And Mr Peltz is not alone at the table. Nestlé, the world’s largest consumer goods group, discovered last month that its SFr259bn market value was no longer a defence against activist incursion. Dan Loeb, founder and chief executive of Third Point, took a $3.5bn stake in the producer of KitKat chocolate and Nespresso coffee.Mr Loeb called for a “greater sense of urgency” in boosting performance at the Swiss company, which he described as “staid” and “stuck in its old ways”. Mr Peltz used similar language about P&G — pointing to “excessive cost and bureaucracy” and “a slow moving and insular culture”.Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, says that activists are stepping up their activity in the consumer goods sector.“Activists have been investing in the consumer sector for several years but there has been a sizeable increase in both the number and size of the companies they have targeted over recent months.”Consumer goods companies can make appetising targets. Companies such as P&G and Nestlé — alongside peers that have come into the sights of activists, such as Unilever and Mondelez — are easily criticised for their sprawling empires, weighed down by excessive costs and inefficient staff protected by the size of the business and ingrained management approaches.But analysts say that the bulk of these companies is almost the point — within their hundreds of thousands of staff, shelves of products and rosters of marketers lies the fat that can be trimmed.Activists see the potential to boost profits by cutting costs and use their large, cash-dispensing balance sheets that have relatively little leverage to boost shareholder returns.“Sales growth in consumer industries has slowed and because of this you are seeing the rise of activist investors, looking to cut costs to boost profitability,” said David Dudding, European equities fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.Analysts say that the strongest impetus for activists is the potential to drive up profits, as demonstrated repeatedly by 3G Capital, the Brazilian-led private equity group. It has for decades been acquiring consumer companies, cutting costs and boosting profits to levels described by Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman emeritus of Nestlé, as “revolutionary”.After 3G bought Heinz in 2013 with Warren Buffett, the ketchup maker’s profit margins soared 58 per cent within two years to 28 per cent — almost twice Nestle’s 15 per cent operating profit margin. 3G and Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group went on to merge Heinz with Kraft in 2015. This year, they stunned the consumer goods world with the $143bn takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever, which is twice the size of Kraft Heinz in revenues. The bid was quickly dropped after stiff opposition from Unilever but the bold approach has left even the biggest consumer goods companies looking vulnerable.“The catalyst for the focus on consumer groups from activists is the increasing polarisation in the sector between those companies that have been through a 3G-style cost-cutting process and those that haven’t,” said Raphaël Pitoun, chief investment officer at Seilern Investment Management.“Companies such as Nestlé, Colgate, P&G and others haven’t been through that process so activists see an opportunity to drive earnings per share growth through cost-cutting.”Mr Peltz has highlighted P&G’s weak organic growth and said its cost-cutting plans have not translated into higher operating profits and shareholder value creation. Mr Loeb’s criticisms of Nestlé are similar. He has called for the company to adopt a formal margin target, something that Mark Schneider, Nestle’s new chief executive, was already considering.Another attraction is the low levels of debt at many large consumer companies, including Nestlé, Unilever and L’Oréal, compared to other industries.Mr Loeb has described Nestle’s net debt of 1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation as “remarkably low”. He has urged the group to double its borrowings, “monetise” its 23 per cent stake in L'Oréal, which is valued at about $25bn, and return capital to shareholders.Mr Schneider announced a buyback programme of up to SFr20bn a few days after Mr Loeb burst on the scene, although Nestlé said this had been planned for months.Unilever too has been jolted into action after the failed Kraft Heinz bid. The company behind Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream has sharpened its focus on profitability, setting a target of 20 per cent operating margin by 2020, from 16 per cent last year.Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever finance director, said on Thursday that it had made €1bn in savings in the first six months of the year out of a three-year €6bn savings programme.The cost-cutting included reducing advertising agency fees by 17 per cent and lowering the average cost of making an ad by 14 per cent. Staff had taken 30 per cent fewer flights, and each seat cost a quarter less.But activist investors are also flush with cash and on the hunt for returns outside the US. For investors such as Mr Loeb, Europe was once seen as an uncertain place to attempt to mount a campaign given varying laws and shareholder rights.All that has changed given the perception of better value in many industries than in the US. David Neuhauser, founder of the small Chicago-based activist investor Livermore Partners, says his fund is increasingly looking to Europe.“I see a lot more things to do in Europe than in the US, and a lot of that is due to valuation and opportunity and growth prospects,” said Mr Neuhauser. “Some of the things in the US, the valuations are high and they do seem to have their defences up quicker.”Moody’s, the rating agency, said that despite experiencing outflows last year “activists still have plenty of spending power to take on even the largest companies”, although it added that they usually target smaller groups.Chris Plath, a Moody’s vice-president, expects more activist campaigns this year. “International activism continues to gain steam. This increase reflects the relative lack of low-hanging fruit among US large-caps.”The big question being asked by executives in the sector is whether the increased activist appetite will be healthy for the industry — stimulating faster change as it grapples with low growth and a shift in the way people buy food and household goods.Or whether activists end up benefiting their funds more than the longer-term growth potential of the companies.Mr Dudding said: “We tend to be agnostic about activists’ presence on shareholder registers. In the long run, consumer staples stocks do better when they reinvest cost savings in driving top line growth and shouldn’t be bullied into prioritising short-term profitability over long-term brand equity.”The ideal is when both sides win. Mr Peltz in 2013 argued that PepsiCo was plagued by a “culture of sycophants”, pushing the company to split its drinks business from its faster-growing snacks unit. Indra Nooyi, chief executive, resisted but eventually agreed to add a Trian representative to the board.PepsiCo shares gained 50 per cent over the course of the campaign, as the company aggressively cut costs and improved margins to take the edge off Trian’s pressure. “In a slow-moving industry like consumer packaged goods, you have a good safety net so companies don’t blow up. So a lot of them have been complacent,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein. “It’s perfect for activism because they have the room to cut massive amounts of costs.”When Dan Loeb announced his largest ever stake in Switzerland-based Nestlé this summer, writes Lindsay Fortado, the move was the latest sign of the interest taken in Europe by activist shareholders from the US.Mr Loeb has been busy this year having also acquired stakes in UniCredit, the Italian lender, and German utility Eon. He was not alone. Elsewhere, Keith Meister’s Corvex Management joined with 40 North to take a 7.2 per cent stake in Clariant, the Swiss chemicals group, in the hope of scuppering its $20bn merger with US rival Huntsman.They follow San Francisco-based ValueAct, which built a 10.8 per cent stake in Rolls-Royce beginning in 2015, and Elliott, Paul Singer’s hedge fund, which has been active in Europe for decades but has been ramping up activity.“As markets rise, people are starting to look for opportunities,” said Reade Griffith, the London-based chief investment officer of hedge fund Polygon’s European event-driven strategy, which sometimes takes a behind-the-scenes activist approach.“There is less competition for activists here and the economic cycle is just turning so the upside in company margins in Europe is significant across many sectors,” Mr Griffith said. “Europe is around the second or third inning out of nine in its economic recovery, while the US is around the seventh or ninth inning, depending on how Trump does.”Europe is no stranger to shareholder activism but most in the past has been conducted by local firms and often with a more “constructivist” behind-the-scenes approach. European activists have already made inroads, however, such as Cevian Capital, Chris Hohn’s TCI, and some smaller peers such as CIAM in Paris and Knight Vinke in Monaco.But Europe may still prove a harder, and unfamiliar, place for US activists to mount campaigns.“In Europe, whilst there are some commonalities, such as antitrust law, that cut across multiple markets, there are a lot of specificities and cultural differences that are unique to each country, so you have to have an understanding of each jurisdiction to be successful,” said Mr Griffith.Eleazer Klein, head of the shareholder activism group at the law firm Schulte, Roth & Zabel, which represents a number of hedge funds, says that Europe is far from being under attack.“As much as you’re seeing the expansion of US activists into Europe, I don’t view it as anything other than a lot of these funds are looking at companies that are underperforming, and they are funds that are not limited to companies that are wholly located in the US,” he said.A chart in this article has been amended to remove an incorrect title. It should have read operating margin, not total shareholder return.
87;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-05-08T17:44:22Z;Buffett, the Brazilians and chainsaw capitalism;A world-beating partnership raises issues about modern economies;It is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, Warren Buffett said this weekend, when questioned about co-investing with 3G Capital, a Brazilian-led private equity firm renowned for sacking workers. His partners “are very good at making a business productive with fewer people”.In a general sense Mr Buffett is right. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that, over the long term, increasing productivity is the essential ingredient of greater prosperity. He is also right about 3G. In 2012, before they were bought and merged by 3G and Mr Buffett, Kraft and Heinz had, on a blended basis, sales per employee of $540,000 and operating profit per employee of $75,000. Last year at the combined company the figures were $670,000 and $110,000. This is remarkable.In the process, some 14,000 jobs were slashed (Kraft Heinz now employs 41,000). The volume of sackings and speed at which productivity jumped raise two questions. Will the gains turn out to be illusory? So much cost has gone out that it is natural to wonder whether the remaining investment is sufficient to spur growth. Second, do the gains really increase welfare, given that much of the profit will go to a handful of rich people while thousands of workers bear the pain?On the first question, it is too early to tell if Kraft Heinz is eating its seed corn. True, sales growth at Kraft Heinz has not been strong in recent quarters. In the most recent one, organic revenue fell by nearly 3 per cent. At Anheuser-Busch InBev, which the founding partners of 3G built — again with acquisitions and cost discipline — into the biggest brewer in the world, sales volumes have declined recently. It would be wrong, though, to infer from this that 3G’s chainsaw capitalism is coming apart. The rest of the food and beverage industry is struggling with growth, too, as consumers leave big brands in favour of niche products.It will take several business cycles to see the long-term impact of 3G’s revolutionary approach. The company’s leaders insist that they want to own the companies they buy forever, that they are happy to invest where they see the potential for high returns, and that their business model does not require large acquisitions to maintain growth. The first claim is supported by the patient building of AB InBev, and the second by the fact that 3G has aggressively built out the Burger King restaurant empire since buying it in 2010. The third remains to be seen. All three claims will be tested eventually, and first at AB InBev, which has consolidated the global industry, depriving itself of large acquisition targets.On the welfare question, the theory was once that the excess profits earned by a company like Kraft Heinz would go to shareholders, who would reinvest it in other enterprises, which would in turn create new jobs to replace the lost ones. It was also assumed that in time competitors would imitate an efficient company’s tactics and attack its market share with discounts. The fruits of efficiency would then be distributed widely, through lower prices.The worry now is that technology and globalisation have brought us to a point where fast-growing new enterprises do not employ as many people as the old ones did. Further, the global consolidation of many industries into oligopolies creates the possibility that excess profits will not be competed away. There is evidence, in the form of stagnant wages and persistently high corporate profit margins, that these worries might be well founded. If that is so, however, the global economy has bigger worries than one very aggressive private equity firm.
88;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-05-07T18:35:04Z;The lean and mean approach of 3G Capital;Founding partner Alex Behring talks about the strategy transforming the beer and food industries;When Rod Miller found out that Warren Buffett was involved in Heinz’s $62bn acquisition of Kraft, he joked with colleagues that the billionaire investor would spare his job and the factory where he had worked for more than 30 years in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley.Deep down, however, the 61-year-old night shift worker in the Italian and Russian salad dressings department knew “Buffett was just like any other businessman”. Moreover, 3G Capital, Mr Buffett’s fellow investors, had a reputation for aggressively cutting costs and jobs.“We knew there was always a risk of job cuts and even factory closure,” says Mr Miller. “But given the strategic location of the plant, we thought we would be saved. We were wrong.”Since 2013, more than 10,000 people — one-fifth of the workforce — have been laid off from Kraft and Heinz, with seven plants shut, highlighting the human cost and upheaval involved in producing the highest profit margins in the food industry. The founders of 3G have transformed the beer, fast food and food manufacturing industries with bold acquisitions, which are quickly followed by a brutal but disciplined attack on costs, a surge in profitability and high returns to shareholders.After 3G bought Heinz in 2013 with Mr Buffett, profit margins rocketed by a remarkable 58 per cent within two years to 28 per cent. Such levels, once thought unobtainable by industry executives, are “revolutionary” in the words of Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, until last month chairman of Nestlé, the world’s biggest food group. The average margin in the food industry today is 16 per cent, according to Bernstein Research.These achievements have earned 3G the respect of investors and the fear of rivals. “3G has been a big wake-up call for the industry,” said Will Hayllar, partner at OC&C, a global consulting firm. “Lots of questions are being asked of incumbent management teams as to whether they really are managing the business as effectively as they could.”Two years after buying Kraft and merging it with Heinz, 3G was expected this year to embark on a big acquisition. But when in February Kraft Heinz and Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group made a bold $143bn takeover offer for Unilever, it flopped. Kraft Heinz had to beat an embarrassing retreat within 48 hours after fierce resistance from the Anglo-Dutch group’s board.The Unilever failure was a rare setback for 3G, which is known for its meticulous planning and steely determination. And it has left the industry wondering where 3G’s next target lies.3G executives persistently decline to talk to the press. But in a rare interview, Alex Behring, one of 3G’s founding partners and Kraft Heinz chairman, tells the Financial Times, there is no necessity for another deal.“Kraft Heinz doesn’t need another acquisition to drive profitable growth for the long term,” he says. “As always, we will evaluate any opportunity that makes strategic sense, with the objective of growing for the long term, whether in the US or internationally.”However, serial acquisitions are one way to increase revenues at a time when processed food manufacturers are being roiled by changes in consumer tastes and feeble sales growth. Even if Mr Behring insists 3G is not dependent on M&A, investors are placing bets on more deals. Valuations of companies in the sector, including Mondelez, General Mills and Kellogg, have risen on expectations that Kraft Heinz is biding its time before striking again, analysts say.***3G takes its name from the three Brazilians who once owned Garantia, an investment bank sold in 1998 to Credit Suisse. It was at Garantia that Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil’s richest man, and his partners, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, hit upon the formula that is shaking up consumer industries today. They bought Brahma, a domestic brewer, in 1989 and used it as a platform to assemble what would become the world’s biggest beer company — Anheuser-Busch InBev — through a series of bold acquisitions over more than two decades.The three men set up 3G Capital as a vehicle to invest in US companies in 2004 along with Mr Behring and Roberto Thompson Motta.With each deal they applied the same tactics: a rapier-like approach to costs, swift promotion for high-performing young talent and transparent annual goals for each employee. The result has been stellar returns to shareholders.3G’s favoured approach to cost-cutting is “zero-based budgeting”: giving managers control of their budget and able to query every cost from scratch. As Mr Sicupira once said: “Costs are like fingernails: they always have to be cut.”Mr Buffett, widely regarded as the world’s most successful investor, is an admirer. He helped finance 3G’s $13.3bn acquisition in 2014 of Tim Hortons, the doughnut chain, and invested alongside 3G in Heinz, then Kraft, through his Berkshire Hathaway investment group.But while 3G has proved that it can make companies more profitable, it has been less successful at delivering sales growth, especially at Kraft Heinz. Sceptics say the heavy cost-cutting comes at the expense of brand-building, and that food is a more complicated business than beer.***In February Mr Behring approached Unilever, hoping to strike a deal. It was a move that Paul Polman, its chief executive, called “a near-death experience” and he quickly sought to halt the advances.Mr Behring told the FT that “our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis only. As it became clear that Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction, we withdrew the offer.”In the past, 3G founders did not give up so easily: InBev’s $52bn bid for Anheuser-Busch in 2008 was strongly opposed at first by the US brewer’s board. However, Mr Buffett, who has always favoured friendly acquisitions, was not involved in that deal.The Unilever debacle raises questions about possible tension between the partners. Without Mr Buffett’s support, 3G’s firepower could be more limited.Mr Buffett has faced persistent questions about his involvement with 3G. He was asked at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting at the weekend about the political risks of his association with a group known for cutting jobs.“The 3G people . . . are very good at making a business productive with fewer people than operated before, but we have been doing that in every industry, whether it is steel or cars, you name it, and that’s why we live as well as we do,” he said.He also emphasised that 3G does not just cut costs but also invests in new products. In the past he has said: “I’ve never seen anybody any better about marketing and product development.”That runs counter to the industry view that 3G starves its brands of investment, a charge Mr Behring rejects. “We build brands. We aggressively reinvest in our product innovation, expansion into global white spaces and brand health,” he says.He points to Burger King as proof. Mr Behring says its growth in sales per US restaurant reached more than $1.3m in 2016, from $1.1m in 2011, equivalent to a doubling of operating profit per restaurant for RBI franchisees. The growth, he says, was driven by new products at Burger King, such as chicken fries, and creative marketing that won the chain a “Marketer of the Year” award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.Kraft Heinz’s retail sales in the US have increased 12 per cent since 2014, he says, thanks to product introductions such as a barbecue sauce range and a mustard for retail customers. New products this year include a selection of fresh foods in a tie-up with Oprah Winfrey and Weight Watchers.Kraft Heinz, along with the rest of the packaged food industry, is battling with big shifts in demand. Consumers want healthier, less processed food, which is often produced by independent companies. Supermarkets are giving more space to fresh food at the expense of tinned and packaged food.Mr Hayllar says Kraft Heinz’s sales growth has performed in line with its US rivals but it has been weaker than that of Nestlé and Unilever, which have bigger operations in emerging markets.Ulf Mark Schneider, Nestlé’s chief executive, did not mention 3G by name at last month’s annual meeting but told his shareholders: “Many companies are focusing on radical cost-cutting to deliver higher profits in the short term. This approach is not sustainable.”***For all the industry’s protestations, 3G can claim to have won the battle — if not the war — about the long-term viability of its business model because a rising number of companies in the sector are adopting some of its practices.Seeking Alpha, the US stock market analysis website, calculates that in 2013, when 3G had just bought Heinz, 14 companies mentioned ZBB — short for zero-based budgeting — on their earnings calls. That rose to 90 in 2015.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThis trend could limit the potential M&A gains to 3G, says Julian Birkinshaw, a professor at London Business School. “The opportunities for 3G to come in and do the same as before lessens compared to when the companies were sleepy and traditionally managed,” he says.The big question is whether 3G’s serial M&A model is destined to fall apart once the pool of targets dries up.“What happens when you can't make any more deals? That will happen at some point. It's inevitable,” says a founding partner at one of New York’s largest hedge funds. “Unless they change tactic and start to aggressively invest in research and development and new growth-generating products, their business is not going to be sustainable in the long run.”In beer, AB InBev has reached that limit in terms of big deals. Having swallowed the London-listed SABMiller last year in a £79bn takeover, it now sells one in four beers worldwide and reaps 45 per cent of the industry’s profits, according to Bernstein. Analysts say the company could diversify into a big soft drinks acquisition by targeting Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.There is still plenty of room for deals in food but the choice of Unilever — Kraft Heinz’s first attempt outside North America — suggests 3G aims to diversify geographically and by business line: most of Unilever’s sales are in emerging markets and nearly 60 per cent of its sales are of personal care brands.Mr Hayllar says that, even if the M&A finally stops, “it doesn’t necessarily mean those businesses are unsustainable but it does become much harder for them to generate significant returns. They will have to play the same old challenging organic growth game that everybody else is having to play.”Mr Behring disputes the portrayal of 3G as ignoring the human toll of its drive towards efficiency. Burger King’s international push has created more than 105,000 jobs, he says.But for workers who are losing theirs it feels very different.“If I go to another job I have to start from the beginning again,” says Juan Perez, who has worked for nearly two decades at Kraft’s Oscar Mayer factory in Madison, Wisconsin. “It’s like wasting 18 years.”Additional reporting by Eric Platt in Omaha1989 - 1999Jorge Paulo Lemann and his Garantia fund partners acquire Brahma, a Brazilian brewer, that will become the first‘platform’ used by the billionaire investors to build a beverages empire.

89;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-05-07T18:34:24Z;Alex Behring reveals his investment philosophy;The transcript of the FT’s interview with the head of 3G Capital;"This is a transcript of a Financial Times interview by email with Alex Behring, co-founder and chief executive of 3G Capital; chairman of Kraft Heinz and Restaurant Brands International and board director of Anheuser-Busch InBev.FT You never give interviews, yet 3G is probably one of the most written about investment groups over the past few years. What does the press have wrong and right about 3G and why?AB At 3G, we are owners of great businesses and brands and our goal is to grow them. We are also promoters of people, and we believe that we attract best-in-class talent because of our long-term focus. We’ve been building businesses for over four decades. We dream big.While we are known for being efficient operators, focusing only on our ability to drive efficiencies overlooks several important aspects of our approach.We are owner-operators first and foremost, as our owners are the individuals directly responsible for operating our companies. Everyone at 3G has considerable skin in the game, which creates powerful incentives to do what is right for the long term. We are fortunate to be differentiated in this sense, as we are not moved by some of the short-term pressures typically felt by other groups. We want to own these companies forever. This gives us the luxury of maintaining a very disciplined approach to each one of our businesses, as we are able to identify and own companies only once we are entirely satisfied that they are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth and successful brand building. A clear example of our long-term orientation is Anheuser-Busch InBev, of which partners of the firm have been meaningful owners since 1989.Most importantly, our greatest resource is our people. At the core of our operating involvement, is the creation and committed implementation of an ownership culture. Our culture of ownership leads to responsible stewardship of capital and resources at all levels of our organisations, and manifests itself in every business decision we make. We find that this culture is perfect for those who thrive in a performance-driven environment, which is why we are able to consistently attract and develop great talent.We build brands. We aggressively reinvest in our product innovation, expansion into global white spaces and brand health. We know that world-class brand reputations take decades to build and only hours or even minutes to lose. We are the stewards of our brands and businesses and are cognisant of that in everything that we do.FT What’s the hardest area of a company’s overheads in which to cut costs and why? How do you achieve those reductions and ensure they don’t rise again? Please give concrete examples.AB We are incredibly focused on finding the most efficient way to do things, and we treat every expenditure as if it was our own personal expense. Our view is that every area of an organisation has opportunities to improve efficiency and no expense is off-limits. In summary, we don’t like to spend unnecessary dollars that don’t directly help our consumer or customers. But it’s not about which departments or areas. It is about finding the right balance of expense reduction and investment.That said, only a very small percentage of our time is devoted to identifying cost opportunities. We believe deeply in incentives and because of that, the vast majority of our energy — and the vast majority of our employees’ performance targets — is linked directly to growth. This is true across all of our businesses, brands, categories and geographies. We set goals based on what is going to create the most long-term value, and invariably that ends up being growth.FT Shareholders love you but many of the people working in the companies you acquire do not. People we spoke to described 3G as lacking moral values and an appreciation for the communities working in, and around, their factories. As one put it recently: “They come in and they just start getting rid of people.” What is your response please and how do you view the issue of the human toll of job cuts? Is economic value created — or is it all about shareholders?AB There is no one corporate culture that appeals universally to everyone and we are by no means an exception to that. Having said that, I wouldn’t agree with the characterisation in the question. Meritocracy is a core pillar of our management philosophy. We enable our people to carve their own path by providing attractive opportunities where they typically gain access to responsibilities and compensation levels much sooner in their careers than they typically would anywhere else. We do make challenging decisions every day as we operate our businesses in the most efficient manner to ensure long-term sustainability and growth, and we carefully consider the implications and effect on the communities in which we operate.We place extremely high value on good corporate citizenship and we treat our people with the utmost respect and dignity. That also includes respecting and being generous with regards to any pre-existing compensation and severance arrangements. We run our businesses the right way, every day. Ultimately, we make decisions based on the benefit conferred to our people and businesses in the long term, even when those decisions may be difficult in the short term.We also believe in giving back to the people and communities we serve. As just one example, at Kraft Heinz the company supports hundreds of non-profit and philanthropic organisations. It recently committed to investing $200m in Growing a Better World through its corporate social responsibility initiatives, and we recently announced that the company will donate 1bn nutritious meals to people in need over the next five years.At Restaurant Brands International (RBI), in 2016 alone the Tim Hortons system raised an all-time record of C$12.6m for the Tim Hortons Children’s Foundation through the brand’s annual Camp Day, and the Burger King system raised $5.9m for the Burger King McLamore Foundation, of which approximately $3m in scholarships was awarded to nearly 2,800 students.FT Do you see the current political environment of the administration of US President Donald Trump’s sharp focus on jobs as a potential brake on your ability to cut jobs in your next acquisitions? Do you think there could be a backlash?AB With respect to jobs, we take great pride in the fact that since 3G acquired Burger King in 2010, the BK system has created over 105,000 jobs around the world by increasing net restaurant count by over 3,500 stores. This job growth is a byproduct of growing the business approximately five times faster than prior to our ownership, and we look to continue this trend across our companies.3G’s strategy is to identify and own companies that are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth and success, and the US continues to be a fantastic place to find these types of opportunities whenever it makes good strategic sense. As always, our focus on long-term growth will continue, with or without another acquisition but, in all contexts, we work collaboratively with all stakeholders, including government agencies and officials as we have done for decades.FT 3G has shown repeatedly that it can improve profitability sharply at companies it acquires. But it cannot demonstrate a similar trend with regard to like-for-like organic revenue growth. Why is this?AB Our objective is always to achieve long-term profitable growth, and there are plenty of examples of this across our companies.Look at RBI. By putting a strategy in place at Burger King focused on menu, marketing, image and operations, we were able to grow sales per restaurant in the US from approximately $1.1m to over $1.3m from 2011 to 2016, which translates into pretty much doubling operating profit per restaurant for our franchisees.We have also accelerated the pace of growth since acquiring the company in late 2010 to make Burger King one of the fastest-growing restaurant brands in the world. Under 3G’s ownership, net restaurant growth accelerated from approximately 170 restaurants per year in 2010 to 735 restaurants per year in 2016, representing a 4.2 times increase. We accelerated this pace of growth by pioneering the Master Franchise Joint Venture model where we have partners with great entrepreneurs in places like Brazil, Russia and China. Back in 2010, Burger King had approximately 150 restaurants in those three countries and this past year we crossed over 1,650 restaurants in these countries. We also are pleased to have recently announced the first agreements under such a model for the Tim Hortons brand as well, having signed master franchise joint ventures in each of the Philippines, Great Britain, and Mexico in the last year.At Kraft Heinz, after a year of significant transformation, we ended 2016 with positive organic net sales growth of 0.3 per cent, which is in line with the peer average of 0.4 per cent. The positive organic performance in 2016 is a trend improvement versus the previous couple of years, in which Kraft Heinz eliminated underperforming stock keeping units and negative-return promotions, in order to generate more funds to reinvest behind the business. We intend to drive continued improvement in our organic sales growth over time.With regard to AB InBev, the company has been savvy about expanding into new regions and capitalising on the strength and global reach of its brands. For instance, Budweiser is consumed in 85 countries and is measured by BrandZ as the world’s most valuable beer brand. It has double or triple-digit growth in more than 15 countries. As an example, the company was able to successfully introduce the Budweiser brand to China and, in the process, created the number one beer in that country. Total volumes of the Budweiser brand worldwide are up approximately 30 per cent since InBev acquired Anheuser Busch in December of 2008, despite challenging trends in its core markets and declining market shares prior to the combination.Examples like these exist throughout the businesses, which is why we are extremely confident in the future growth of our companies.FT 3G has undoubtedly had an enormous impact on the food and beverage industry, but corporate longevity and legacy stem from inventing new products that consumers can’t get enough of. Disruption in the industry is coming from new and smart companies, not the mature/older ones you invest in. Is 3G’s legacy going to end up being its specialised application of zero-based budgeting?AB 3G has long been a proponent of ZBB [zero-based budgeting], in which every employee at every level of our company makes financial decisions as if they were spending their own money. ZBB is not simply a cost-cutting measure. It’s a daily mindset that is resistant to complacency and promotes responsible stewardship of our resources.But instead of focusing on what will define our legacy, we simply focus on what we do best: maximising business potential by investing in people and brands.RBI, for example, has consistently experienced impressive same-store sales growth and restaurant growth since the 3G-led turnround. This type of growth does not happen without continually offering innovative choices to our customers.Focusing specifically on Burger King, we differentiate ourselves not only by flame-grilling our burgers and through our groundbreaking advertising campaigns. Just weeks ago, Burger King was awarded Marketer of the Year by the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Some our creative marketing campaigns that contributed to this award include the McWhopper Proposal, #WhoIsTheKing, King Games and Subservient Chicken.We have also applied innovation to our product platforms, an example of which would be our Chicken Fries at Burger King. We have rolled out several limited-time Chicken Fries offerings such as Cheetos Chicken Fries and Jalapeño Chicken Fries, each of which have given our guests further reasons to revisit our restaurants. At Tim Hortons, we recently announced the rollout of a new espresso-based beverage platform (through the implementation of new espresso machines that freshly grind coffee beans and steamed real Canadian milk) in Canada to extend our “coffee authority” status in brewed coffee to espresso-based coffee.Additionally, back in 2015 we acqui-hired a team of engineers who formed “RBI Digital,” which has been working hard to roll out digital technology that enhances our guests’ experiences with our brands. They are currently beta testing new digital apps with functionality such as pre-order and pre-pay. These apps will meaningfully enhance the experience of how guests interact with our restaurants. We anticipate rolling out these apps later this year and are excited by the great progress our RBI Digital team has made in such a short timeframe.Here’s another example from Kraft Heinz. Heinz, a brand that’s almost 150 years old, has grown 12 per cent at retail in the US since 2014 thanks to innovations in Heinz Ketchup and successfully extending the Heinz brand into new retail categories. We have also introduced iconic, century-old brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese and Planters to millions of new consumers around the world. Of note, since the merger, Kraft Heinz has focused its marketing efforts on working media that effectively reach and benefit consumers. In fact, the company increased its working media spend in the US by nearly $100m over the past two years.All of our companies are constantly adjusting to changes, including new consumer demands and evolving technology. We constantly aim to stay ahead of these changes, and we believe we have best-in-class innovators across our businesses to tackle these challenges.FT 3G’s value creation comes from making ever-larger acquisitions at regular and repeated intervals with the bulk of returns coming through the consolidation, synergies and cost-cuts of the first few years. Cheap debt plays a big role in this. Do you agree that this is a different business model from that of traditional companies? Why continue with the serial M&A otherwise? A different way of looking at this question is the argument that the 3G cost-cutting model works in relation to mature, low-growth businesses — but not ones with high-growth potential because they require more investment.AB The question mischaracterises our approach to ownership. The core of our strategy is to identify and own companies that are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth, the bulk of it coming organically. Value creation doesn’t just come from acquisitions, and indeed, acquisitions are not our focus.For example, we have accelerated the pace of growth since acquiring Burger King in late 2010 to make it one of the fastest growing restaurant brands in the world. As a part of our image focus within our “four pillar” strategy under 3G’s leadership, we and our franchisees invested meaningfully in restaurant remodels, developed a unified global brand image and went from having approximately 20 per cent to approximately 70 per cent of system restaurants under a modern image, vastly improving our guests’ experience.FT What happens when the M&A opportunities run out and how far off that point is 3G? In beer, the model has already reached its limit in terms of large-scale M&A. Sceptics say that without large-scale M&A, the model is doomed to failure (or at best 3G will then face the same growth difficulties as the rest of the industry). What is your response please? In any case, is there not a limit to how big a company can become, without becoming unmanageable?AB We are long-term owners with a near-infinite time horizon, very unlike the typical private equity model. Our model does not rely on M&A. In building efficient companies through a culture of meritocracy and ownership, we free up capital to reinvest aggressively behind our brands and businesses. Product innovation and effective marketing are central pillars of our strategy, and serve as growth drivers at companies like RBI and Kraft Heinz.FT So far the beer business has been kept separate from 3G Capital investments. Might that change in the future? What would future possibilities for co-operation between the beer, food and fast food companies you control look like? If not, why not?AB The businesses in which 3G Capital and its partners invest execute their respective goals and strategies independent of each other. They operate as individual entities with clear priorities to grow their world-class brands. And they do this through focused investments that leverage their innovation capabilities, global reach and consumer-first approach.FT 3G folks hadn’t failed in a bid to take over a company before the aborted Unilever attempt. What went wrong and what are the biggest lessons you’ve taken away from that experience? If news of KHC’s approach of Unilever hadn’t leaked do you think you would have had a better chance to convince Unilever’s board about the merits of the deal? Since Warren Buffett wants only friendly deals, does this limit the scope of dealmaking with him in the future? How reliant is 3G on Mr Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway group for financing future deals?AB The chances of any large-scale M&A deal getting to completion are by definition always slim, so we are fortunate to have been able to complete successfully so many transactions involving iconic and global brands in the past few years.Our interest in Unilever was unfortunately made public at an exceptionally early stage and, under UK takeover rules, we were required to disclose our initial approach. We and Berkshire Hathaway had agreed from the outset that our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis only. As it became clear that Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction, we withdrew the offer. We respect Unilever’s culture, strategy and leadership, and we wish Unilever the best of luck in the future.We have a proven track-record of creating significant value for the shareholders of companies that have recently merged with ours. Recent examples include total appreciation of approximately 90 per cent for Kraft shareholders since mid-2015 merger with Heinz that created Kraft Heinz, and approximately 160 per cent total appreciation for Tim Horton’s shareholders since the December 2014 merger with Burger King that created Restaurant Brands International. Therefore we don’t need to go anywhere that we are not welcome by shareholders in order to do a deal.FT Before you made an attempt to acquire Unilever with Kraft Heinz, there was a lot of talk about 3G “setting up a new platform” to build from scratch. Is this new platform personal care and household goods? Is it still the new platform you wish to develop?AB We will always evaluate any opportunity that makes sense for our investors, our consumers and our brands — within our existing portfolio or as a new platform.FT Following the failure to acquire Unilever, should we expect KHC’s priority for an acquisition to be 1) markets outside the US; 2) in the US; 3) or even to try and grow independently?AB Kraft Heinz doesn’t need another acquisition to drive profitable growth for the long term. The company has a world-class portfolio that can travel and has a lot of whitespace in front of it. Right now, the company is focused on building great brands that consumers love and on developing top talent who can lead these brands into the future.As always, we will evaluate any opportunity that makes strategic sense, always with the objective of growing for the long term, whether in the US or internationally."
90;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-05-07T17:20:15Z;3G Capital to seek only friendly deals;Head of buyout group behind Kraft Heinz rules out hostile bids in rare interview;The buyout group behind Kraft Heinz has ruled out making hostile bids following the failure of its $143bn Unilever offer, saying 3G Capital will seek only friendly deals in future.Alex Behring, the Brazilian private equity group’s co-founder and chief executive, told the Financial Times in a rare interview: “We don’t need to go anywhere that we are not welcome by shareholders in order to do a deal.”His comments come as billionaire investor Warren Buffett defended 3G’s aggressive cost-cutting style, telling investors on Saturday that it was “pro-social” for companies to lay off staff, given that productivity gains were crucial to advancing the economy.Mr Behring, who is also chairman of Kraft Heinz, which 3G controls with Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group, deflected criticism that the New York buyout group only cut costs and destroyed jobs.The executive, part of a close-knit group around Brazilian billionaire and 3G co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, said: “We’ve been building businesses for over four decades. We dream big.”But he added that 3G did not need to make acquisitions to boost margins at Kraft Heinz.Financial analysts have argued that Kraft Heinz, which is struggling to increase revenues, will need to buy another company to sustain high returns.We will evaluate any opportunity that makes strategic sense, always with the objective of growing for the long term whether in the US or internationallyAsked about Kraft Heinz’s next potential target, Mr Behring said: “We will evaluate any opportunity that makes strategic sense, always with the objective of growing for the long term whether in the US or internationally.”Mr Lemann and his partners are serial dealmakers who have built their fortunes in beer and fast food. The total value of deals they have backed, as either majority or minority stakeholders over the past three decades, amounts to $250bn — bigger than the economic output of Chile or Finland.Warren Ackerman, analyst at Société Générale, said: “The question really is: what does Kraft Heinz want — food or home and personal care assets?”Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningMr Ackerman said the aborted Unilever offer suggested that Kraft Heinz believed another US food company would not solve the problem of low sales growth: the majority of Unilever’s sales are in soap, deodorants and laundry products.“This perhaps suggests a pure play home and personal care company might be next — Colgate would be the obvious one but a cheaper alternative would be Kimberly-Clark,” he said.3G was forced to drop its offer for Unilever in February after strong opposition from the UK’s third-biggest company by market value. It was the first time 3G has been defeated in a big takeover battle.Additional reporting by Eric Platt in Omaha
91;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-05-03T20:24:23Z;Kraft Heinz earnings hit by North American sales slump;;Kraft Heinz, the packaged-food company behind brands like Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, reported sales fell 3 per cent in the first quarter, as snack food industry strives to adjust to more health-conscious consumers.The company’s shares slid 3.2 per cent in extended trading after it reported adjusted earnings of 84 cents a share, falling short of analysts’ estimates of 86 cents a share. Sales slipped to $6.36bn, down from $6.57bn a year ago in the first three months of the year. Wall Street analysts had forecast sales of $6.45bn.Organic net sales fell 2.7 percent versus the year-ago period, much steeper than the 0.7 per cent drop the market had forecast.The company said the results reflected sluggish demand in North America – with sales in the US, its biggest market, down 3.5 per cent to $4.6bn while those in Canada dropped 12.2 per cent to $443m.However, the company insisted that its cost savings strategy is helping to combat sliding revenues. “Although our top line results…reflect a slow start to the year, we remain on track with our key initiatives,” said chief executive Bernardo Hees.Kraft Heinz –which came together in a $100bn deal devised by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital in 2015 — has been looking to become leaner to offset declining sales. It aims to cut costs by $1.7bn annually by 2018.Kraft Heinz in February tried to buy Unilever for $143bn, but was rebuffed. Shares have grow more than 13 per cent in the past year.
92;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-04-27T16:16:07Z;Unilever hits out at failed Kraft Heinz bid attempt in AGM;;"Ouch. Unilever may have beaten off Kraft Heinz’s $143bn bid but the bruises still show.Paul Polman, chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting in London on Thursday that: “Ostensibly the bid was from Kraft Heinz, a company less than half our size. In practice, the prime mover was a Brazilian private equity firm, 3G, with a reputation for deep cost-cutting and single-minded focus on shareholder value.”Marijn Dekkers, the former head of Bayer who is chairing his first set of the Anglo-Dutch group’s annual meetings, said he was glad Kraft Heinz, had walked away quickly.The Kraft Heinz model was “unsustainable” in the long-term,” he told shareholders, as it was based on “deep cost reductions; a highly leveraged balance sheet; and a relatively low investment level in brands and R&D.”Apart from the odd awkward question, such as why Mr Polman was embarking on a €5bn share buyback, having previously been critical of such schemes – shareholders were supportive, with one praising the group’s “marriage of profitability and values”.Mr Polman ducked a question about whether Unilever, which is examining whether to ditch its dual-headed structure, would favour the Netherlands over London as its base.But he said he had met Sir Jeremy Heywood, the UK’s top civil servant, over Brexit policy – Mr Polman was a vocal supporter of the UK remaining in the EU – and would be back at Number 10, the prime minister’s residence, next week too over the issue."
93;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-04-09T16:05:59Z;Unilever and the UK’s next hostile takeover bid;An unequivocal defence of investment over cost cutting is needed;"When Kraft Heinz of the US made an offer for Anglo-Dutch Unilever earlier this year, the target declined the bid instantly. Its chief executive suggested that the UK takeover code needed firming up to protect “national champions”. UK Prime Minister Theresa May directed aides to assess the need for government intervention. Last year, by contrast, when Japan’s SoftBank announced its purchase of the UK’s most valuable tech company, Arm Holdings, Mrs May’s chancellor of the exchequer said the deal was proof that Britain was an “attractive destination globally for investors”.Why was one bid a national threat and the other a national affirmation? It is not that one target resisted and the other did not. The legitimacy of a takeover is distinct from whether management welcomes it. Nor should the fact that Unilever is a well-known corporate brand, whereas how Arm makes its money is little understood, make a difference.The key difference was surely that Kraft Heinz is an extension of 3G Capital, a private equity group dedicated to adding leverage and cutting costs (Kraft’s dishonest behaviour after it bought UK’s Cadbury, shutting down plants it had committed to keep open mattered too).Concerns about hyena-style capitalism are often legitimate. Short-termism among dealmakers, financial engineers and public companies is worrisome. At the same time, though, not all cost- or finance-driven strategies amount to asset-stripping or speculation. Capital should be ripped out of unproductive businesses. Balance sheets should be efficient. Having governments determining which corporate deal strategies are legitimate is a bad idea.It would be much better if companies defended themselves by laying out the advantages of what Unilever calls “investment-led growth” over slashing and borrowing. The only other option (once government intervention is put aside) is for companies to see off opportunistic buyers by pre-empting them: taking costs out and adding leverage themselves.Unilever’s management was fortunate in that Kraft Heinz was easy to discourage. The next bidder may not be. This week, the company rolled out its post-bid strategy. It reaffirmed its growth targets and maintained reinvestment as its top use for the cash it brings in. At the same time, though, it is accelerating its cost-cutting programme, borrowing money to buy back shares, selling its margarine and spreads division, and rearranging its remaining businesses so that, at some future date, a separation of its food businesses might be easier to complete.Unilever, then, is 3G-ing itself — halfheartedly. The new borrowing is not enormous, the cost cutting will be hard to verify and the spreads business may have gone anyway. Its choices may be right. But a more robust defence of investment-led growth from a company under threat — whether Unilever or some other — would be welcome. Unilever would have been a good candidate to mount such a defence. It has a very clear and differentiated growth strategy, which is high exposure to emerging markets. It could have argued that it was poised for a turnround in those markets after a tough post-crisis period.What is dangerous is not leverage, cost-cutting or spin-offs per se; it is the reflexive notion that these represent the only options for big companies that have fallen into productivity slumps. A headline-grabbing acquisition target that gave a full-throated rejection of this dogma would be a gust of much needed fresh air."
94;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-04-06T17:32:20Z;Unilever shake-up wins over investors;Failed bid by Kraft Heinz spurs plans to sell margarine unit and buy back shares;Investors broadly welcomed measures unveiled by Unilever on Thursday to boost returns after the multinational rejected a $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz.Following a wide-ranging business review, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group plans to sell its margarine unit, launch a €5bn share buyback and set targets for substantially higher profit margins.The company said it would double savings expected from an existing three-year cost-cutting programme, to €2bn.Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, a top 40 investor, with 0.7 per cent of Unilever shares, said the measures were “a proportionate response” to the Kraft Heinz bid. “We would expect these actions to improve the outlook on future returns for shareholders,” he said.Unilever’s shares closed 1 per cent higher at £39.78 — above the £39.50 informal offer in February from Kraft Heinz. The US food group, backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, the private equity group co-founded by three Brazilian billionaires, quickly dropped its bid in the face of Unilever’s opposition.Celine Pannuti, analyst at JPMorgan, said: “Even though the outcome of the strategic review was largely in line with expectations, management reached out to different shareholder expectations by reinforcing its steady growth-driven model and accelerating short-term value through faster margin and cash.”The FTSE 100 company has been under pressure to boost profitability and speed up the pace of growth since rebuffing the approach from Kraft Heinz.Paul Polman, Unilever chief executive, said although the Kraft Heinz bid had been “shortlived and opportunistic, it did raise expectations”.3G has set new standards of profitability in the consumer goods industry through aggressive cost-cutting, igniting an argument about the balance between investing for growth and boosting profits.Ulf Mark Schneider, Nestle’s new chief executive, told shareholders on Thursday at the Swiss group’s annual meeting: “Many companies are focusing on radical cost-cutting to deliver higher profits in the short term. This approach is not sustainable.”Unilever also indicated that it might be interested in acquiring Reckitt Benckiser’s food business, which includes French’s mustard. Reckitt said on Monday it had begun a strategic review of the business, since it was non-core.The review stopped short of radical measures sought by a minority of shareholders, such as a demerger of the food and personal care businesses.But it opened the door to such changes by saying it would review its dual-headed legal structure — the group is listed in both Amsterdam and London. Simplifying the structure could make it easier in future to demerge businesses or make sizeable acquisition, analysts said.Unilever said it would sell, or demerge, the spreads business, owner of brands such as Flora, which analysts value at €6bn-€7bn. Though the unit is highly profitable, revenues have been in decline in the face of changing consumer tastes for more natural products, such as butter.In a radical — though expected — departure for the conservative company Unilever said it would gear up its balance sheet and targeted a ratio of two times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The company’s net debt to ebitda at the end of 2016 was 1.3 times.Unilever’s strong balance sheet had made it vulnerable to Kraft Heinz, which had intended to use it to help finance its takeover.The company said it would maintain the “flexibility” for acquisitions. It added that in the absence of any deals, it would return further cash to shareholders beyond the €5bn it announced on Thursday that it plans to pay out in 2017.Some savings are to come from simplifying the business, including the decision to merge the foods and refreshment businesses into one unit. Foods includes Marmite spreads and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, while refreshments comprises ice cream, such as Magnum, and tea, including Lipton and PG Tips.The measures were behind Unilever’s target for increasing operating profit margins to 20 per cent by 2020 from 16.4 per cent currently.Cedric Besnard, analyst at Citigroup, said: “We view these targets as both preserving the economics of a growth model skewed towards emerging markets, whilst offering enough earnings growth to support recent re-rating.”Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein, said the measures had largely addressed investors’ hopes. “We believe much of today’s news was already in the stock.”This article has been amended to correct an error regarding where Unilever is listed
95;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Kraft Heinz: the next meal ticket;An analysis of the tasty options left on the Buffett-3G table;The financial engineers who run Kraft Heinz value returns on acquisitions through a “risk-adjusted” lens. The bigger the reward, the more the American food group and its backers, 3G Capital and Warren Buffett, are willing to venture out on a limb. Likely paybacks vary widely from target to target.A Lex analysis shows the group’s swashbuckling, if futile, pursuit of Unilever made sense. Kraft Heinz, with an enterprise value of nearly $150bn, would have got a bang for its buck with the similarly sized Anglo-Dutch group. A tie-up could have boosted earnings per share by perhaps as much as a fifth (at least before the recent rally in Unilever shares).More modest businesses may now be more receptive to the overtures of Kraft Heinz. But rewards will be commensurately humble.The deep pockets of the company’s Brazilian and Nebraskan patrons get disproportionate attention. However, Kraft Heinz stock itself represents formidable firepower. The forward P/E ratio based on 2018 estimated earnings is 22 times, a premium to most potential targets. Issuing shares then comes out to a rough cost of capital of less than 5 per cent, probably less than the company’s cost of debt.The group has said it wishes to keep its investment grade credit rating. With such a high valuation multiple, using its stock as a big chunk of its M&A currency is a plausible choice.Make your own calculations on the potential targets for the Buffett-3G backed food giantSnack company Mondelez, once part of Kraft, is thought to be one object of Kraft Heinz’s affections. Assuming it pays a 25 per cent premium, offers a quarter of the price in its own shares and knocks off a quarter of Mondelez’s overheads, Kraft Heinz’s earning per share could jump by a tenth. In this, as in other deals, cost cuts should cover the premium.Two other rumoured targets, Colgate-Palmolive and Clorox, happen to trade at higher respective multiples than Kraft Heinz. Each also represents a way to diversify into personal care and household goods.For the reputedly number-focused Kraft Heinz risk, then, is not just about deal tactics and valuation but also strategic direction. 
96;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-03-16T17:46:22Z;Unilever investors favoured talks with Kraft Heinz;Survey shows shareholders welcomed negotiation with Warren Buffett-backed group;"Unilever should have held talks with Kraft Heinz instead of sharply rejecting the $143bn bid that led to the speedy withdrawal of the US food group, according to a majority of its shareholders surveyed by a brokerage.According to the poll conducted by Bernstein, published on Thursday, 53 per cent of Unilever shareholders surveyed said they would have liked the Anglo-Dutch owner of Axe deodorants and Magnum ice cream to have negotiated with Kraft Heinz.Of those in favour of engagement, the majority said they wanted a 40 per cent premium to Unilever’s share price, instead of the 18 per cent premium proposed by Kraft Heinz, which is backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital.A week after dropping the bid, Mr Buffett told CNBC media that he had received calls “indicating the offer was unwelcome . . . And if it’s unwelcome, there’s no offer”.Unilever argued that the offer substantially undervalued the group — but it acknowledged the need to deliver value to shareholders more quickly and announced a sweeping review of its operations.Bernstein surveyed 96 investors, of whom 74 identified themselves as Unilever shareholders. There was a 50-50 split among the broader group.Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein, said: “It was interesting to note that a strong majority of non-shareholders approved of management’s decision not to engage . . . but [Unilever] shareholders were slightly against management’s decision. Perhaps this is because shareholders had money actually invested in the decision.”There were also regional differences: 60 per cent of UK investors supported the rebuff but only 41 per cent in North America and 44 per cent in Europe.A Unilever spokesperson said: “We have spoken to our top 50 shareholders and the feedback we have received from the vast majority is very different — they have been unequivocal in their support for our rejection of the bid. Around 70 per cent of our shareholders have held a position in the company for more than seven years.”According to Bernstein, top of investors’ demands, when asked what the outcome of Unilever’s review should be, was to boost profit margins and increase borrowings for acquisitions and share buybacks. Many investors also said they wanted the underperforming margarine business to be sold or spun-off.The aversion of Paul Polman, chief executive, to large-scale M&A was shared by many of the investors.Those who preferred Unilever to maintain its unique combination wanted the company to explain better the value of keeping the two businesses together.Unilever is understood to be tilting towards returning cash to shareholders, making medium-sized acquisitions and more aggressive cost cuts when it announces the outcome of the review next month.One large shareholder told the Financial Times: “There’s a big gap between Unilever’s existing cost programme and what the Kraft plan would have been. So we need to see some pretty compelling targets about what they can achieve; anything less and the market will put pressure back on Unilever.”Mr Wood said: “Overall, many investors now require a strong improvement in the share price, to compensate for Unilever’s refusal to engage with Kraft Heinz, and for the lost premium.”The shares have bounced strongly since the Kraft Heinz approach. At £40.48, they are trading above the £39.50 implied by Kraft Heinz’s 18 per cent premium to Unilever’s price before the ketchup maker confirmed its approach on February 17, after a report in the FTAlphaville blog."
97;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-03-15T21:14:44Z;Former security guard accused over Heinz insider trading;Work at board member’s home included access to emails about Buffett and 3G deal;The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused a former security guard for a Heinz board member of insider trading ahead of the food group’s takeover by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital in 2013.Todd David Alpert was working at the unnamed board member’s New York home as a dispatcher when the Heinz board was discussing the acquisition proposal from Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, according to a complaint filed with the US District Court of the Southern District of New York on Wednesday.The SEC said in the filing that Mr Alpert had “misappropriated material non-public information about the acquisition from the board member . . . in breach of a duty of trust and confidence and in breach of a confidentiality agreement”.Neither Mr Alpert nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.The commission said Mr Alpert bought 1,000 shares of Heinz stock and 30 call options which he sold on the day the deal was announced, from which he made a profit of nearly $44,000.The initial approach to Heinz in January 2013 was priced at $70 a share, but the offer was raised to $72.50 by the time an agreed bid was announced on February 14. The announcement of the deal sent Heinz’s shares up 20 per cent.The SEC settled an unrelated case against two Brazilian brothers for $5m in October 2013 over accusations that they were behind suspicious trading in call options ahead of Heinz’s takeover.Heinz has since taken over Kraft, creating a combined food group called Kraft Heinz.The SEC’s complaint claimed Mr Alpert’s work meant he was involved in “various aspects of the personal, day-to-day lives of the board member and the board member’s family”.This included answering phone calls and reviewing email messages sent to a designated “security email account”. Some of the emails contained information about the deal, including details on pricing and timing, the SEC said.Mr Alpert placed an order to buy 1,000 shares of Heinz’s common stock, according to the complaint. A few days later he purchased 10 call options, it said.On February 8, another email was forwarded to the security account, providing an update on the transaction and including a comment from Heinz’s chief executive that “tremendous progress” had been made, information to which the SEC claimed Mr Alpert had access. The SEC said Mr Alpert then bought 20 further Heinz options.On the day of the announcement, the filing said, there were five phone calls between Mr Alpert and his broker through which he sold his shares and options.In July, Mr Alpert admitted to the board member that he had traded Heinz’s stock based on the private information to which he was privy, which the board member considered a breach of trust and of his terms of employment, the filing said.Mr Alpert pleaded his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination when questioned by SEC staff, according to the filing.Kraft Heinz declined to comment.
98;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-03-14T17:31:39Z;Unilever: underlevered;Discouraging further approaches is the chief executive’s job, not that of legislators;The Pot Noodle is a snack available to anyone with spare change, a kettle and low standards. It would be an odd symbol of a British backlash against foreign takeovers if lobbying by manufacturer Unilever succeeds. The UK should remember the scorn France fielded after mooting national champion status for yoghurt maker Danone. Strong companies can defend themselves unaided.The food and consumer products group has been rattled by an abortive approach from US rival Kraft Heinz. Chief executive Paul Polman cannot be the only worried UK boss. US stocks have soared and US bond yields are low. Cash and shares are both cheap acquisition currencies. The dollar is strong against the pound. UK politicians and regulators have been relaxed about foreign bids.Kraft’s purchase of confectioner Cadbury in 2010 prompted rare controversy. The Takeover Panel, an independent watchdog, overhauled its rules. To forestall sieges, would-be acquirers must bid or walk away within 28 days. Mr Polman believes this has given Kraft an ambusher’s advantage. This is unconvincing, given targets have far longer to frame a defence.The government, for its part, rightly ignored proposals for legal reforms. These included restricting votes on bids to long-term investors and giving “other stakeholders” a say. The state should only circumscribe property rights in cases of glaring inequity.Besides, Unilever saw off Kraft Heinz. Discouraging further approaches is Mr Polman’s job, not that of legislators. RBC predicts that Unilever will only have net debt equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at the end of this year. Increasing that ratio up to two times would deter opportunists and finance €11bn in payouts and acquisitions.Many in the City would not even flinch at trebled leverage. Easy, tiger. Unilever is already adopting zero base budgeting, the cost-squeezing gambit of Kraft Heinz backer 3G. Higher debts could make a business currently proud of its long-term returns averse to investment too. All good things — a category that excludes Pot Noodles — should be enjoyed in moderation.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
99;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-03-05T05:00:58Z;Unilever’s brand of responsible capitalism should be lauded;A focus on sustainability drives long-term value, says Stewart Investors’ Jack Nelson;Since Kraft Heinz, the food company, withdrew its offer for Unilever, analysts have been calling for the consumer goods conglomerate to “accelerate earnings” and become “more aggressive”.Some are speculating about spin-offs and large acquisitions. Others suggest Unilever ought to gear up its balance sheet with debt in order to buy back its own shares.Radical corporate restructuring or a bout of financial engineering might benefit short-term market participants, but Stewart Investors is convinced it will be detrimental to long-term shareholders.Running any business involves striking a balance between the present and the future. Companies that ramp up profitability for a few years tend to suffer later as a result of that under-investment.The management teams of most listed companies struggle with this, and much of the blame should be laid at the door of short-term orientated stock markets and impatient shareholders. Average holding periods are now measured in months, not years, and many investors want immediate results.The cacophony of voices from “the market” seeking to pressure Unilever’s management into action seems premised on the misplaced notion that the company has been underachieving.In reality, Unilever has been particularly successful at striking the right balance between present and future needs and ambitions. This has enabled the company to deliver not only for its shareholders but also on its broader social purpose.Investors in Unilever’s London-listed shares have been rewarded with a return of just under 13 per cent a year over the past decade, versus a little over 5 per cent a year in the FTSE 100. Sustained for 10 years, this has meant a 230 per cent return versus 66 per cent for the index. This is a company that has delivered handsomely for its shareholders.Through its so-called sustainable living plan, Unilever is strengthening the agricultural practices of 600 000 farmers in its supply chains. It has reduced the water intensity of its factories nearly 40 per cent. It is helping reduce child mortality by educating more than 300m consumers in developing countries to use soap.No company is perfect. But these are not the achievements of a struggling organisation in need of a shake-up.Indeed Unilever’s commitment to sustainability seems a particularly popular target for critics keen to point out that the company is failing to allocate resources and time efficiently. This seems to betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the company’s history, value system and competitive advantages.Rather than an optional extra, the sustainable living plan is a central tenet of Unilever’s identity, aspirations and long-term strategy.The crucial point is that rather than a drain on resources or a distraction for management, sustainability leadership has helped to drive superior investment returns over time.Constructive partnerships with smallholder farmers have helped to make the company’s supply chains more efficient and resilient. Environmental efficiency measures have taken cost out of the business and resulted in margins higher than they would otherwise be.Innovative and empowering distribution models have built brand loyalty in emerging markets and positioned the company to grow sales for decades to come in countries such as Nigeria, India and Indonesia.These investments in the business involve Unilever making a choice to defer some of today’s profits in order to realise greater gains tomorrow. In many cases they may take years — not a few quarters — to bear fruit. And they cannot be captured properly by spreadsheets and financial models. It should come as no surprise, then, that many investors do not see much value in such initiatives.As a significant shareholder in Unilever on behalf of our clients, Stewart Investors will be encouraging Unilever’s allegedly “chastened” management to resist short-term pressures to take corporate action in the wake of the Kraft-Heinz approach.Instead we will be supporting them to continue doing what Unilever has done for 130 years: pioneering responsible capitalism and combining sustainability leadership with ample rewards for long-term, patient shareholders.Jack Nelson is an investment analyst at Stewart Investors, the asset manager
100;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-03-02T07:00:18Z;Companies with a declared purpose perform better;Britain is biased towards a short-term view of capitalism, says Will Hutton;"Big takeovers stir controversy but the clash between Kraft Heinz and Unilever, the consumer goods companies, broke new ground. As soon as Unilever signalled it was prepared to fight, Kraft Heinz beat a retreat.A battle between a representative of responsible capitalism and the red-blooded cost-cutters at Kraft Heinz was one that, in today’s climate, Kraft Heinz could not win. Society is asking harder questions regarding what constitutes good capitalism.But if Britain celebrates such companies, it should also recognise it has too few of them. This scarcity is reflected in Britain’s consistently poor levels of investment and innovation coupled with stubbornly low productivity growth. Against the background of multiple challenges such as Brexit and the digital revolution, the economy needs more great companies that put long-term value creation at the heart of what they do. What to do? Eighteen months ago, the purposeful company task force was convened. It includes a broad range of companies that want to think through a response. The overwhelming evidence is that companies with a declared purpose — a clear role in the world that offers them a reason for being — perform better on important metrics over time than their less-purposeful peers.Purposes can take any number of forms. Some want to be the best, as Apple, the technology group, and BMW, the carmaker, would both claim; some to be sustainable, to challenge incumbents, or to make what is available to only a few, available to all. But all involve a notion of human betterment that goes beyond meeting short-term financial targets. They also involve building relationships of genuine respect and reciprocity with customers, employees and suppliers. But the British financial, regulatory and ownership ecosystem is hostile to purposeful companies. The interaction between the way companies are incorporated and the short-term priorities of capital markets, made more acute by Britain’s uniquely dispersed and fragmented pattern of share ownership, is particularly biased against the delivery of purpose.Nor are matters helped by an extraordinarily transactional asset management industry, or any of the incentives — including executive pay — throughout the system. The UK government seems to recognise that reform is needed.For all its apparent blandness, the recognition that purpose counts is a profound step. To deliver purpose, a company has to transition from being essentially about a web of transactional contracts to one in which purposed relationships underpin what it is doing.Yet Britain’s business ecosystem is heavily biased towards a short-term, contractual view of capitalism. Our task force has broken new ground in its policy report, published this week, to argue that the response must be systematic. It must encompass company law and accounting, repurpose the investment industry, foster new shareholder structures, develop new sources of capital to finance purposeful companies and rethink executive pay.Declaring purpose must be legally enshrined in companies’ articles of association. The asset management industry should declare its purpose and implement it in its investment strategies. British companies have too few block shareholders they can rally behind their purpose.Company leaders should be rewarded for delivering purpose over the long term. Members of pension funds should have the default option of investing in purposeful companies. If set at 20 per cent per person, it could create up to £100bn by 2030 to invest in purposeful companies. British capitalism needs a new settlement with each initiative, building cumulatively to produce the change that is needed.The aim is the creation of an innovative, purposed capitalism populated by purposeful companies. Now is the moment to begin the journey. Will Hutton is co-chairman, with Clare Chapman, of the Big Innovation Centre purposeful company task force"
101;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Brexit effect shakes up London dealmaking;Currency falls and cheap capital clash with political uncertainty;"Over the past fortnight, two giant corporate takeover offers have spread alarm through Whitehall. Not since Pfizer’s abortive hostile bid for the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca in 2014 have attempted deals caused such a fluttering in UK government ranks.First came Peugeot’s proposal to buy GM’s European car making business, an event that prompted UK business secretary Greg Clark to rush to the bidder’s Paris headquarters in search of assurances about the future of two Vauxhall plants in Britain.Later that week came an even bigger shock, with the leak of a £115bn approach by the aggressive cost-cutting US conglomerate Kraft Heinz to acquire Unilever, Britain’s third-largest company. The bid was swiftly abandoned after a withering rejection from the target, but not before panicked ministers had asked officials to examine whether it would raise policy issues, such as over the future of Unilever’s headquarters, its UK listing and jobs.The revival of the contentious mega takeover bid is seen by some as a sign of animal spirits returning to company boardrooms. The world may still be riven with political uncertainty, observe City bankers, but offsetting this factor, they claim, are the drivers of currency devaluations and cheap capital. These are helping corporate bosses recover their dealmaking mojo.“I think we are going to see more very large-cap M&A,” says Alasdair Warren, head of European corporate and investment banking at Deutsche Bank. “This will partly be driven by relative currency values and people reacting opportunistically to the dislocation in values that has occurred because of Trump and Brexit, but also because people have realised that despite the increase in political turmoil, the world has continued growing.”One of the biggest mergers struck before the UK’s vote to leave the EU — the proposed €29bn tie-up of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse — was on the verge of collapse on Monday, partly due to growing concerns from politicians in Germany and the UK about the impact of Brexit.The big uncertainty in some dealmakers’ minds is how the government and ministers might react to an M&A boom at a time when they are also trying to navigate the shoals of Brexit — a process in which corporate relocations and job losses will inevitably form part of the political battleground. The possibility of an ugly face-off over Unilever certainly seems to have weighed with Warren Buffett, a key backer of the Kraft Heinz approach, who historically has avoided hostile takeovers.“This government is turning French — it is dirigiste and protectionist,” says one senior dealmaker. “And that makes Britain less favourable for M&A.”Exactly how far ministers will go to protect British companies is an issue given added urgency by prime minister Theresa May’s commitment to a new industrial policy. Unveiled in Birmingham last July at the launch of her Conservative leadership bid, she has vowed to create a “proper industrial strategy” that could step in to defend important sectors of the British economy from short-term stock market actors and raiders, citing pharmaceuticals as an example. She wanted to do “something radical”.Other developed nations are also looking harder at foreign takeovers. The US has long taken a restrictive view of overseas companies attempting to make acquisitions in the high tech and energy sectors. Recently the German government has followed suit, seeking to block Chinese takeovers of sophisticated engineering firms.But it is the UK where tensions are at their highest, as the two recent corporate takeover attempts have set government nerves jangling about the possibility of a fire sale of British companies linked to Brexit.Despite some bankers’ nervousness about increasing protectionism, many City practitioners still believe the decline in sterling since before the referendum vote has made UK assets more attractive to foreign buyers. Their assumption is that the pound has bottomed and might rally once Mrs May triggers Article 50, signalling the UK’s formal intention to leave the EU.“Currency alone doesn’t make the difference between doing a deal or not doing one,” says one banker. “But at a time when returns are hard to come by, the idea that a sterling rebound could give you a few bips of excess performance can make the difference between opportunistically acting and holding back.”There is little sign yet of a sustained pick up in takeover activity. The total value of deals involving UK target companies almost halved last year to $222bn from its near-record 2015 total of $432bn as bidders battened down the hatches ahead of the EU referendum. This year has seen only a modest recovery, and there has so far been little linkage between falls in the pound and surges in M&A.But two major British companies — chip designer Arm Holdings and pay-TV broadcaster Sky — have agreed to be acquired since the Brexit vote and any further increase in ambitious M&A by overseas bargain hunters could expose a contradiction at the heart of Mrs May’s industrial strategy.The prime minister has said that last year’s Brexit vote showed people wanted “more control of their lives” — including seeing the government defend them from predatory foreign acquisitions. But she has also promised to make post-Brexit Britain a “champion of free trade”.So far, hard choices have been avoided. When Japan’s SoftBank launched its £24.3bn takeover of Arm last summer, Mrs May waved it through — with commitments on jobs and the UK headquarters — and Mr Hammond called it “a great vote of confidence” in Britain.But big takeovers of consumer brand companies that are driven by the need for cost savings raise more awkward questions.“We had a lucky escape when Kraft pulled out,” says one senior government figure. “People are bloody relieved. It would have flushed out whether or not we are serious about this whole protectionism thing. But that deal won’t be the end of it, the sterling situation means there will be more bids down the line.”Some financiers think other big name companies are potentially vulnerable.Another driver of takeover activity is the continuing availability of finance, which puts even the biggest targets like Unilever in reach. “We are still in a world of very cheap capital and relatively low growth, and this is a world in which large businesses acquire, consolidate and drive out costs,” says Mr Warren.But many also dismiss the idea of a fire sale, pointing out that UK businesses have come through the referendum relatively unscathed.“Business owners have been a lot less negative about the impact of Brexit than economists or political commentators,” says Christopher Sullivan, an M&A partner at the lawyers Clifford Chance. “I don’t think it has changed vendors’ expectations or desire to get out.”Theresa May will try to construct a new framework for assessing foreign takeovers in the coming days with the publication of a plan for assessing foreign investments in “critical national infrastructure”.The review was ordered by the prime minister amid concerns in Downing Street about Chinese investment in Britain’s nuclear power sector; the question is how exactly “critical national infrastructure” is defined. Mrs May’s speech in Birmingham last year suggested that pharmaceutical companies might also be included but senior government officials say they expect the definition to be much more tightly drawn.The 2002 Enterprise Act only allows ministers to block mergers on grounds of national security, media plurality and financial stability.While expecting some tweaks to expand the government’s scope for intervention, the City remains unconvinced that the ministers will massively expand their grounds for intervention. “In the aftermath of Brexit the country needs to be open for business,” says Christopher Sullivan, an M&A partner at the lawyers Clifford Chance. “It is difficult in that context to set up new barriers such as an expanded public interest test for takeovers.”When the green paper on industrial strategy came out a few weeks ago, it made no specific reference to takeovers or M&A despite being 128 pages long."
102;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-26T18:46:31Z;Unilever’s best option may be to do nothing;After a bid attempt, the inclination to overreact needs to be resisted;"Don’t just do something — sit there. This old joke, which might do double duty as a Zen koan, is not to be dismissed. It is of particular use for the boards of public companies, who are under constant pressure to take action, even when inertia would be wiser.The pressure is never greater than when a company has rejected a premium bid from a rival. So Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, and Marijn Dekkers, its chairman, will be feeling the heat. They have seen off a $50-a-share cash-and-stock offer from Kraft Heinz, an 18 per cent premium to the share price before the bid became public, saying the bid undervalued their company. An iron law of convention dictates that Unilever must now perform a review aimed at discovering and realising the value that the suitor overlooked. It has done so. “The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,” the company said.A company in this position has a short list of options. It can announce a bold cost-cutting plan; pay a bigger dividend; do a share buy-back; split itself up; buy another company, or some combination of these.One or more of these choices may be fitting. This may indeed be true in Unilever’s case. But there are four good reasons for Unilever, given its particular circumstances, to be suspicious of all of them.That the bid from Kraft Heinz was seen off with such ease suggests that it was a misjudged effort by the Kraft Heinz team. It is absurd to contemplate a new strategy because someone else made a mistake. There is the old saw that any company receiving a bid is “in play”. But this is no game. A suitor with as much financial firepower as any in the industry has just been turned away. Imitators will think twice.Second, Unilever’s long-term record is respectable. This does not imply that management is doing a good job but it does suggest that its problems are not of the structural sort that may require a big transaction to solve. Over 20 years, Unilever’s shares have returned nine per cent a year on average, better than most benchmarks.Its performance does trail Nestlé — but Nestlé is, arguably, the best-run consumer company in the world. Over ten years, the performance has been closer to average and revenue growth has been modest, three per cent a year. Margins are lower than some competitors. So there is clear room for improvement.Unilever’s special strength, however, is its deep presence in the emerging world, where it earns more than half its revenue. It has been an uneven decade for the developing world. As a long-term bet, though, these make as much sense as ever.Next, doing big things — as companies under pressure do — is expensive, even if those costs are often hidden. Fat fees for bankers and lawyers are just the start. Restructuring costs that follow a big acquisition or spin-off are often left out of the “adjusted” profits reported when the deal is done. This is unfortunate, because the costs are real, and go on for years.Finally, Mr Polman and Mr Dekkers must realise that because the “normal” behaviour expected from leaders in their position is bold action, they will be dangerously biased in that direction. They know that if they do nothing, and Unilever’s fortunes do not improve, they will face more criticism, and possibly feel more regret, than if they had “at least tried something.” But this is irrationality itself. Choosing to do nothing is, ultimately, an action like any other, to be assessed in just the same way. If more business leaders recognised this, we would live in a richer, if less exciting, world."
103;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Dealmaker Michael Klein helped kill Kraft Heinz bid for Unilever;Financier called Warren Buffett to explain political hurdles;Warren Buffett was persuaded to drop Kraft Heinz’s $143bn takeover approach for Unilever by the corporate financier Michael Klein, making the dealmaker the unlikely executioner of what would have been the second-largest merger in corporate history.Earlier this month, Kraft Heinz, which is backed by Mr Buffett and Brazil’s 3G, revealed that it was seeking to acquire the Anglo-Dutch company behind brands such as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.Two days after the proposal became public on Friday February 17, Mr Buffett, the billionaire head of Berkshire Hathaway, awoke to a letter from Paul Polman, Unilever chief executive, explaining his hostility to the deal.Mr Klein, a former Citigroup executive who has worked alongside Tony Blair, former British prime minister, on some deals, then telephoned Mr Buffett to explain political sensitivities around the deal, according to people briefed on the discussion.In the UK, Theresa May’s Conservative government has been pushing for stronger industrial policy that safeguarded jobs, and MPs had already voiced opposition to the deal. In the Netherlands, home of half of Unilever, parliamentary elections are scheduled for March 15.Within hours of Mr Klein’s call, Kraft Heinz had pulled its bid.Mr Klein is better known as a consummate dealmaker. He helped to organise peace talks between Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore chief, and Mick Davis, Xstrata chief, which paved the way for an $90bn merger of the two commodities groups in 2013.Representatives at M Klein & Company, Mr Klein’s advisory group, could not be reached for comment.The failure of the Kraft Heinz approach for Unilever is a rare stumble for Mr Buffett and his partners at 3G.The latter is known for adopting aggressive cost-cutting tactics that are upending the consumer goods industry. They have taken stakes in the beverages group Anheuser-Busch InBev and Restaurant Brands International, the owner of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains.Last week, Unilever said the aborted bid had been a “trigger” for it to work harder and faster on delivering better returns to investors. It has launched a review of its business to be concluded by early April.This article has been amended. Warren Buffett says he did not speak directly to Paul Polman, contrary to an earlier version of this article. And Tony Blair and Michael Klein worked together on deals rather than founding a firm.
104;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-24T18:58:38Z;Unilever defends rebuff of Kraft Heinz deal;Consumer industry ponders which group might be next on the menu for 3G;"Unilever said on Friday that Kraft Heinz’s aborted $143bn bid had been a “trigger” for it to work harder and faster on delivering better returns to investors.It was the Anglo-Dutch group’s first public remarks since Kraft Heinz — backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital — revealed its approach a week ago.Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever finance director, told attendees at Cagny, the consumer industry’s annual gathering, in Florida: “It has certainly been a trigger for Unilever and we will not waste it. It showed us the challenge to unlock value quicker in the shorter term.”He blamed Unilever’s vulnerability as a takeover target on poor communication of its midterm plans and slow growth in emerging markets, which had contributed to its share price underperformance.Mr Pitkethly defended Unilever’s rapid rejection of the Kraft Heinz approach by highlighting the difference in business strategies between the two groups.Unilever would generate higher returns “indefinitely” and “sustainably” over the long term, while Kraft Heinz’s depended on “repeated portfolio change”, he said, in a reference to 3G’s serial dealmaking.Mr Pitkethly was tight-lipped on the details of a sweeping business review to boost profits that Unilever announced on Wednesday. But he indicated that the company would be sharper on driving down costs. “It’s clear we can go harder and deeper,” he said. The outcome of the review is expected in April.The big question dominating — but not directly addressed — at the conference was which company would be next on the menu for 3G.This made Kraft Heinz all too present — despite its absence at Cagny — though some delegates said they had spotted Alexandre Behring, Kraft Heinz chairman and 3G partner. It was Mr Behring who first mooted the idea of a deal for Unilever with its chief executive Paul Polman, last month.“They have a list of targets, A, B, C,” said one person who knows 3G well. “If A doesn’t work out, they’ll move quickly on to B.”Some of the industry’s biggest names — Mondelez International, Danone, Kellogg’s, General Mills and Procter & Gamble — showcased their strategies on cost-cutting, growth and ecommerce at the conference.We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 yearsMany of these sounded like “a defence against a possible bid”, said one analyst.Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever — which makes 60 per cent of its sales in home and personal care products such as Surf laundry and Sunsilk shampoo — has broadened considerably the spectrum of the food group’s potential targets.Cedric Besnard, analyst at Citigroup, said that food, home and personal care companies “with [an operating profit] margin below 20 per cent and a market cap below $140bn — and with no controlling shareholder — could feel the urgency to work on their portfolio and/or cost structure to avoid an unsolicited offer”.Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said US companies such as Mondelez and General Mills still seemed the most logical targets for Kraft Heinz as “Europe may be resistant politically to a takeover at least in this environment”.PepsiCo could not be ruled out, she said, given the potential to pass on the beverage business to Anheuser-Busch InBev, in which some of the 3G principals are shareholders, while retaining the Frito-Lay snacks business.Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Mondelez, attempted to bat away the attention, insisting that “the macro environment was hanging over a lot of presentations. I’m hopeful we distinguished ourselves with great hope and optimism”.Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone, the French dairy and nutrition company, was asked whether he felt vulnerable, given the company’s recent underperformance. “We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 years,” he said.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive — which leads consumer companies in terms of profit margins — said he “doesn’t want to be distracted by chatter”. Some Unilever investors have said privately they would like it to acquire some of the US company’s businesses, funded by disposals in its food units that include Flora margarine and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.“When you look at the bath and shower market shares of both companies, or oral care, body care, facial care, shampoos — there’s a lot of synergies available from putting those two businesses together,” said one investor who did not wish to be named.The industry’s sluggish growth and 3G’s voracious appetite are likely to spur deals between companies to forestall a 3G approach.Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli, which has $40bn assets under management, said: “The industry isn’t in a steady state right now. The cost of capital is very low. We’re going to see consolidation in both [household products and food]. 3G is clearly looking for a deal, but others could look for M&A as a defensive move.”But fresh from Kraft’s unwanted advances, Mr Pitkethly said: “It’s certainly been a busy old week. When Paul [Polman] and I announced earnings [in January] we said we expected volatility — but certainly didn’t expect a bid for the company.”———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverRobert Armstrong: Hyena capitalism receives a swift kick from the Unilever giraffe

105;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-24T09:47:19Z;Unilever deal talks highlight risk for financial PR;Conflicts of interest seen as inevitable given small pool of agencies with scale ;"With more than 400 agencies around the world to juggle, Sir Martin Sorrell’s international advertising group WPP is well accustomed to dealing with potential conflicts between rival brands and clients.But rarely has Sir Martin had to directly intervene, as he did last weekend, to keep one of his biggest and most important customers happy. WPP’s financial PR agency Finsbury and founder Roland Rudd had fallen into a messy conflict of interest over what would have been the second biggest takeover deal of all time, raising fresh questions about the ethics and relationships in the growing communications industry.With Unilever — the second largest advertiser in the world and one of WPP’s largest spenders — fighting off a hostile $143bn takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, Mr Rudd was hired on Friday to advise the US food group.But according to people close to the deal, which collapsed on Sunday night, Finsbury was removed from the Kraft advisory line-up after Unilever chief executive Paul Polman discovered the WPP-owned agency was acting on the other side to his company.An email exchange between Sir Martin and Mr Polman on Saturday night left little ambiguity, people familiar with the aborted deal said. Finsbury was replaced by rival financial PR firm FTI Consulting, while Tulchan acted for Unilever.“I just don’t think anyone [at Finsbury] thought about the Unilever clash and because it all happened so quickly Martin probably didn’t know what Roland was doing,” says one PR industry executive.The episode highlighted the challenges PR agencies face when they are owned by multinational holding companies with such diverse interests from advertising to strategic consultancy. “This is a deviation that is unacceptable in our world,” the outgoing Publicis chief executive Maurice Lévy told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. “When it comes to operations like a takeover, we have to be extremely clear to support a longtime client.”In the end that was exactly what Sir Martin did. But he also followed the money.The fees on offer for PR advisory firms for a big takeover deal can run to many millions of pounds. For example, Brunswick, the London-based PR company run by Sir Alan Parker, earned $20m from AB InBev’s £79bn takeover of SABMiller last year. But they pale in comparison to the advertising spend by Unilever’s global brands such as Dove and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. Finsbury was unlikely to earn enough to risk jeopardising Unilever’s long standing relationship with the company’s advertising agencies, according to one PR executive.“When the chief executive of one of your biggest clients phones up and asks you to get out the way, you generally don’t tell them where to go,” the executive adds.Finsbury, which declined to comment for this article, was bought by WPP in 2001 as the world’s biggest advertising and marketing group sought to diversify beyond its core business. It also owns Ogilvy Public Relations and Buchanan Communications.This is a deviation that is unacceptable in our world. When it comes to operations like a takeover, we have to be extremely clear to support a longtime clientThe cut throat industry has seen rapid growth and consolidation in recent years as PR groups have responded to the increasingly global needs of corporate clients.And yet PR executives told the FT such conflicts were unusual for Mr Rudd and his team. “I genuinely think this was a one off,” said a person close to the aborted deal. “The model has always been that you have multiple agencies working with multiple clients.”Takeover deals almost always involve a PR agency on each side, with companies only able to choose from a relatively small pool of financial advisers of sufficient scale. It is not surprising for a company to find a PR once on its own books now working for a rival or even potential acquirer.But even PR agencies which are not owned by a multinational media conglomerate face daily dilemmas when making sure they work with the right client. To illustrate the ever shifting loyalties in a fiercely competitive market, Finsbury acted for Cadbury in its doomed defence against Kraft’s 2010 takeover. Some rivals are less worried about having the same PR advisers. When Finsbury took on Marks and Spencer four years ago, the company had to get approval from its existing British retail client J Sainsbury.Other companies do care. In 2012 Bell Pottinger’s public affairs division had to drop its work for Kellogg’s after another part of the company was hired by Kraft’s global snacks business, Mondelez.Rachel Fellows, Kellogg’s UK corporate affairs director, told industry magazine PR Week at the time that the decision followed a “review of our internal structure”.Unlike investment banks and legal firms, which run strict conflict of interest checks before agreeing to take on clients, the rules in the PR industry are less rigid.“Conflicts are in the eye of the companies involved,” says one senior PR executive.Any advisers acting on a merger or acquisition in the UK are regulated by the Takeover Panel, which sets strict rules on what each of the parties can say publicly and when. But the panel says nothing about who PR agencies can and can’t act for in deals. The Chartered Institute for Public Relations does set down some principles on transparency and conflict in its code of conduct, urging members to clearly disclose any conflicts in writing “as soon as they arise”.But the sanctions are hardly severe and PR executives said that in practice each firm was left to follow its own internal rules on conflicts of interest.Bob Willott, an accountant who edits a marketing and financial newsletter for the PR industry, said: “I don’t think that the degree of ethics and conduct that is commonplace in the legal or investment banking industry has yet permeated public relations. This is a clear case for the PR industry to examine how realistic its code of conduct is.” ———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverJohn Gapper: Warren Buffett needs a new recipe for investing

106;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Unilever: an alternative pivot;The group cannot assume its world returns to normal after rebuffing Kraft Heinz;If last week’s bid approach by US food company Kraft Heinz to Unilever has done nothing else, it has sent the latter’s executives and bankers into a tizzy of action.The Anglo-Dutch group has promised a review of its businesses, not least because operating margins of 15 per cent look weak compared with rivals such as London-listed Reckitt Benckiser or even L’Oréal of France.One oft-cited remedy is to jettison the less-profitable foods division. Think again. There is another way.Clearly, Unilever cannot assume that the world returns to normal after last week’s terse rebuttal of Kraft. Simply look at Unilever’s share price which, at £37, is more than a tenth above the pre-offer level.Moreover, even a cursory glance at Kraft’s profitability versus its target suggests plenty of opportunity for margin enhancement.Any proposal to sell elements of the foods unit, in particular the mature Flora margarine business, would not go far enough. To have a significant impact, a sale of all of foods would be required, with shareholders in the rump company pocketing the income.Yet the foods business has an operating margin of 18 per cent, not too far from that of Unilever’s top performing personal care division, which Unilever boss Paul Polman would not wish to give up.Foods also earns far above the 10 per cent margins of either home care or refreshment units. Selling off foods would, therefore, dilute the group’s profitability.Consider a different approach. Spin out the home care and refreshment segment, together generating €20bn in revenues.If products in those businesses happen to share the same distribution platform as other Unilever wares — for example, from personal care — then the company should retain a minority stake big enough to influence marketing rights.Unilever would then deconsolidate home care and refreshment from the remaining group, lifting the operating margin by about 3 percentage points.That would represent some pick-up on Unilever’s latest outlook of less than 1 per cent improvement this year — itself a rise on an earlier forecast of a measly 40-50 basis points.Yes, Unilever would remain a mixed bag of foods and personal care products. Yet the promise of a cash return to shareholders plus improved profitability in the remaining business makes this spin-off plan attractive.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
107;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
108;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-22T15:35:11Z;Unilever to review business following Kraft Heinz bid;Company pledges to hit higher profit targets after aborted bid raised questions over operations;"Unilever has promised to boost profits and conduct a root-and-branch review of its business that could lead to asset sales just days after an aborted $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz, the US food group backed by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett.Unilever is under pressure to speed up returns to shareholders following the bid from Kraft Heinz, which has raised questions about the consumer products group’s structure and profitability.The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate said on Wednesday it would conduct “a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders”. Unilever said its review would be completed in early April.In a second statement, delivered a few minutes after the first, Unilever said it would boost operating profit margins to meet “the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance”.Previously, it had said the margin improvement would be at the lower end of the range. Unilever’s profit margins are half those of Kraft Heinz, suggesting that the business could be run more efficiently.The group, which owns food businesses such as Magnum ice cream as well as home and personal-care brands including Dove soap and Surf laundry powder, acknowledged that it had been shaken into action by the tumultuous events of the past week.On Friday, Kraft confirmed its $143bn approach, only to back off barely 48 hours later after encountering stiff opposition from Unilever chief executive Paul Polman and the company’s board as well as political resistance in the UK and the Netherlands.Unilever conceded that the returns it has been promising in a three-year plan unveiled last year — including $1bn of savings — needed to be delivered more rapidly to shareholders.“The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,” it said.Shares rose by 7 per cent on Wednesday afternoon, returning close to the level they hit following news of Kraft Heinz’s approach on Friday.James Targett, analyst at Berenberg, said the Kraft approach could spur Unilever into radical steps such as selling off underperforming foods and refreshments businesses that include Hellmann’s dressings, Flora margarine and Lipton tea to fund a large acquisition in personal care.Mr Polman has favoured small-scale acquisitions to push the group further into home and personal care, which now accounts for 57 per cent of sales.“The problem is that these acquisitions are too small to move the needle,” said one person who knows the company well.Unilever has been urged by some investors and analysts to use its strong balance sheet either to accelerate investments in the new acquisitions or buy back shares.The company’s review of its business has also raised questions about its future management. Samuel Johar, chairman of corporate headhunter Buchanan Harvey, said: “We should give the board credit for acting so quickly. I’m sure one of the issues the board will be considering is the succession of the chief executive who has been there for eight years.”Some analysts suggest that Kraft Heinz could still acquire at least some of the Unilever business. Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, said: “A future Kraft takeover of part of the Unilever business, perhaps part of its foods division, is still possible.”———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverJohn Gapper: Warren Buffett needs a new recipe for investing

109;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-22T13:13:15Z;Unilever to review options to ‘accelerate’ benefits to shareholders;;Unilever said on Wednesday that it has started a “comprehensive review” of options to deliver value to shareholders, just days after talks over a potential tie-up with Kraft Heinz fell apart.The company said that “the events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever”.It expects the review to be completed by early April.Separately, Moody’s Investors Service, the credit ratings company, said on Wednesday that it reckons Unilever may now be considering increasing payouts to shareholders or ramping up its M&A activity with the Kraft-Heinz deal off the table. It noted that Unilever has the “flexibility” to increase shareholder distributions within its A1 rating.Unilever shares rose to hit 3 per cent higher on the day.
110;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-22T12:01:38Z;Warren Buffett needs a new recipe for investing;Kraft Heinz’s failed Unilever bid shows the food industry has run out of growth;"Warren Buffett once observed that, “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.” So what happens when an investor with a holy reputation tackles an unholy task?One answer was given this week by Kraft Heinz, in which Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is a leading investor. It withdrew a $143bn attempt to take over Unilever amid hostility to its relentless approach to cutting costs and jobs. Mr Buffett, who sits on Kraft Heinz’s board, clearly wanted his reputation for saintliness to remain intact.Paul Polman, Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, runs the multinational as an exemplar of sustainability and stakeholder capitalism rather than the pure shareholder variety, and the abortive bid pitched two of Mr Buffett’s instincts against each other. One is to invest in processed food and drink companies such as Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz with reliable global brands; the other is to be liked.The latter does not bother Jorge Paulo Lemann, the Brazilian billionaire whose 3G Capital private equity firm is cutting through the food and drink industry. As growth has slowed nearly to a halt thanks to price deflation and competition from makers of healthier fare, 3G has reacted by rolling up consumer groups and slashing budgets.It troubles Mr Buffett and so it should, for it strikes at the heart of how he built his company, and his unique investment record. “At Berkshire, we only go where we are welcome,” he promised in his 2015 letter to shareholders in a defensive passage about how he works with 3G despite their conflicting methods. If nothing else, it displayed the tension in his own mind.It was once easier to be nice. Although Berkshire Hathaway has made much of its money in insurance, Mr Buffett was happiest investing in consumer brands, particularly in the US, with a “moat” to protect them: they were less vulnerable to competition because people always needed to eat, drink and buy household products, and instinctively turned to familiar names.A quarter century ago, his biggest non-financial investments — the “sainted seven” — were brands that included See’s Candies and Nebraska Furniture Mart. The sweet spot emerged in the 1980s as US companies started to go global. In his 1989 shareholder letter, he noted that overseas sales of Coca-Cola, in which he had just raised his stake, were “virtually exploding”.Mr Buffett embodies his belief in food brands. He drinks several cans of Coke a day, often accompanied by potato sticks made by Utz, a Pennsylvania company he has discussed buying, and picks up breakfast from McDonald’s on his drive to work. He ingests as he invests.He used to enjoy another advantage: owning strong brands in growing markets meant that he could leave the executives who ran them alone, rather than ripping up their way of operating. “Our role is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs . . . can maximise both their managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs,” he wrote last year.But the food and drink business has developed in ways that makes such cosiness impossible to sustain. Companies such as Unilever and Nestlé are larger and more global — collections of billion-dollar brands rather than owners of one or two. They are run by a global cadre: the top two executives at Kraft Heinz hail from Brazil.The industry has also stopped growing. The international acceleration has given way to falling sales at some companies and lacklustre expansion at others. Nestlé last week announced a “time out” from annual organic sales growth target of between 5 and 6 per cent. Even before Kraft Heinz’s bid, Mr Polman had adopted 3G’s cost-cutting mantra at Unilever.Hence Mr Buffett’s hesitation. His investments alongside 3G Capital first in Heinz and then Kraft have been highly profitable but sit uncomfortably with his preference for maximising happiness. Kraft Heinz has shed 13,000 jobs since the companies merged two years ago — as Mr Buffett says, 3G specialises in “eliminating many unnecessary costs . . . very promptly”.The Unilever bid has confronted him with a choice. He either has to behave with naked aggression in the industry he knows best or find other outlets for Berkshire’s capital. I doubt whether he could change personality at the age of 86 even if he wanted to, so he must amend his investment strategy.He is doing so. Berkshire holds 9 per cent of Coca-Cola but it has shed investments in Procter & Gamble and Walmart, and the “sainted seven” consumer companies have been overtaken in importance by a “powerhouse five” of industrial holdings. They include BNSF, the US railroad group that he acquired in 2009, and Lubrizol, which produces speciality chemicals.Neither makes tasty snacks but both meet his aim of investing in “large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires”. They are also growing profitably without the need to slash costs and jobs. The food and drink industry used to be like that but it is no longer sweet enough for Mr Buffett.john.gapper@ft.comAbandoning the Unilever bid was a rational decision / From Bert Hancock, Omaha, NE, US"
111;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-21T19:25:18Z;The $143bn flop: How Warren Buffett and 3G lost Unilever;The story behind the failure of Kraft Heinz to win over the Anglo-Dutch giant;Paul Polman thought it was just going to be an informal catch-up. But it quickly became clear that Alexandre Behring, chairman of Kraft Heinz, had something very specific on his mind when he visited Unilever’s art deco headquarters in London last month.Had Mr Polman, chief executive of Unilever since 2009, ever considered a collaboration with Kraft Heinz, Mr Behring wanted to know. Mr Polman took this as a sign of interest in Unilever’s spreads unit, home to brands such as Flora margarine, which his company considered “non-core”.When he pressed Mr Behring for more details, the Brazilian businessman offered to return soon with a more thorough presentation. It was clear now to Mr Polman that this was no ordinary visit. He quickly assembled a small group, led by chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly, to try to predict what the Kraft Heinz executives might be thinking.The team began to consider what it viewed as the worst-case scenario: a takeover bid. Even though its US rival was far smaller than Unilever — a multinational corporation with annual sales of €52.7bn and 168,000 employees — Kraft Heinz could still afford a debt-fuelled acquisition of the Anglo-Dutch company.The proposition was one to be taken seriously, given that 50 per cent of Kraft Heinz was owned by two formidable dealmakers, Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, the secretive private equity group that has been upending consumer industries from beer to fast food.Mr Behring, a partner at 3G, returned to Unilever’s headquarters on February 10. Over sandwiches, Mr Behring laid out his audacious plan: Kraft Heinz would acquire its rival for $143bn, the second-largest takeover in history.The cash-and-stock offer, which had the full backing of Mr Buffett and 3G’s founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, would create a global consumer powerhouse. Yet the proposal, to say nothing of the $50-a-share bid, which Mr Polman thought grossly undervalued his company, was appalling to the Dutch chief executive.“The idea of being acquired appeared to blow his mind,” one person said about Mr Polman’s reaction to the offer.Another insider said: “When they put something on the table, Paul was just utterly categorical that there was no merit. He gave a number of reasons why there was no interest in such an offer.” The offer was rejected immediately.Mr Behring was surprised by Mr Polman’s unequivocal response. He thought their first meeting had gone well. This misreading would be the first in a series of mistakes that resulted in the bid’s collapse only nine days later.When Kraft Heinz unexpectedly withdrew its bid on Sunday, it handed the first public defeat to a group of globetrotting investors who are not used to seeing their ambitions thwarted. The Financial Times interviewed more than a dozen people involved in the takeover battle to reveal how Unilever was able to beat back their offer.A deal would have created the world’s second-largest consumer company by sales behind Nestlé. For the maker of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, it would have more than tripled last year’s annual sales of $26.5bn and given the predominantly US-based group a deeper reach into emerging markets where Unilever dominates.From Mr Behring’s point of view, the timing was ideal. The 17 per cent slump in sterling since the UK voted to leave the EU in June meant he could buy some of the world’s most recognisable brands — from Dove soap to Ben & Jerry’s ice cream — in a once-in-a-lifetime sale.For the Brazilian billionaires behind 3G, a Unilever acquisition would cap nearly 25 years of ever larger deals, including investments in beverages group Anheuser-Busch InBev and Restaurant Brands International, the owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons.“The deal made perfect financial and strategic sense for them, but absolutely none for us,” says one person close to Unilever.Kraft Heinz had misread Mr Polman, who likes to talk about managing growth for the longer term. By investing in its brands and promoting initiatives such as environmental sustainability, Mr Polman has sacrificed short-term profits for longevity.In contrast, 3G has rapidly transformed the consumer industry by slashing costs, cutting jobs and raising profit margins. In a sector buffeted by slower growth and changing consumer habits, investors have cheered its austere management discipline, including a strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Rivals have recoiled at what they view as a model that ultimately destroys businesses by starving them of investment.Yet some investors have questioned whether 3G’s tactics are too mercenary. Mr Buffett, who has built up a grandfatherly image as a hands-off acquirer and advocate of well-run companies, has faced criticism even from his own shareholders about 3G’s more ruthless approach to dealmaking.“I tip my hat to what the 3G people have done,” he said in response to a question at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2015 annual meeting. He added that there were “considerably more people in the job than needed” at companies that 3G had bought. A combined 13,000 workers have been cut since Mr Buffett and 3G purchased HJ Heinz and merged it with Kraft Foods in 2015.Still, 3G’s critics in the industry have been forced to respond to its aggressive management style — including Mr Polman, who last year outlined a three-year plan to boost profit margins and growth.But 3G should have realised that Mr Polman would never fully embrace its philosophy. That would mean that Kraft Heinz may end up having to go hostile if it wanted to buy Unilever — a tactic Mr Buffett has vowed publicly that he would never use in his deals.Kraft also miscalculated on another front: the changes sweeping the UK following the Brexit vote. Theresa May’s conservative government has become hypersensitive to the notion that British companies can be bought for knockdown prices due to the economic repercussions of the referendum.A deal that could have also come with ruthless job cuts would encounter further political resistance — giving Mr Polman and his team another tool in their defence.Mr Behring left Unilever’s offices with Mr Polman promising to get a full response from his company’s board after their next meeting, set to be held later this month. Mr Polman immediately called and hired Nick Reid and Robert Pruzan of Centerview Partners as his financial advisers.Unilever’s team eventually grew to include Henry Stewart and Mark Rawlinson at Morgan Stanley, UBS, Deutsche Bank, law firm Linklaters and Tulchan Communications for public relations.As the group studied the Kraft Heinz bid more closely it came to understand what the US company was attempting to pull off. The cost savings from combining with Unilever’s packaged foods business alone were enough to justify a big premium for the whole company, even though the unit was only 40 per cent of its sales. By that logic, Kraft Heinz would then be getting the rest of Unilever effectively for no premium.The group studied 3G-backed takeovers and concluded Kraft Heinz would try to seem as friendly as possible and then increase its bid in increments until there was sufficient pressure from Unilever investors. This was 3G’s modus operandi. “We didn’t want to get in that situation, so we needed to hit them early. Our best chance was to get them off the pitch early,” said another person involved in the company’s defence.They decided that Mr Polman should press ahead with a long-planned trip to Southeast Asia to not raise suspicions.Because Kraft Heinz’s courtship was so young, secrecy became paramount to the success of its bid. But by last Wednesday, some investors and journalists had been notified about unusually high options trading in Unilever’s US-listed shares.The next day, Kraft Heinz reported lacklustre quarterly results that investors saw as a sign that the company’s cost-cutting had reached a limit. Shares in the company sank 5.5 per cent.Meanwhile, the Kraft Heinz board, which includes Mr Buffett, was holding a tense meeting. They feared that news of their bid was about to spill into the market, said two people briefed on the mood at that gathering. “The goal was to try to delay the leak as much as possible,” one of the people said.By mid-morning on Friday, they were proved correct. The FT’s Alphaville blog revealed the details of the Kraft Heinz bid. Within half an hour, the US company confirmed it had “made a comprehensive proposal to Unilever about combining the two groups”. It added that the offer had been rejected but suggested that the door was still open.Unilever slammed the door shut an hour later. In an unusually terse rejection, it said the Kraft Heinz offer “fundamentally undervalues” the company and that the proposal had “no merit, either financial or strategic”.Kraft Heinz had expected its first offer to be rejected but was caught off guard by the harsh language Unilever used. “Everyone thought there was a relationship of mutual respect but clearly they went out strong on the culture stuff . . . making Kraft Heinz look like the bad guy and Unilever as the angel,” a person close to the US company said.Kraft Heinz’s advisers at Lazard and law firm Paul Weiss, its top management and 3G executives regrouped later on Friday to find a new way forward. Additional advisers including PR companies Finsbury and Joele Frank were brought on. Shares in both companies soared to close the week. The US group was willing to pay substantially more.However, more fissures appeared. UK politicians started voicing their concerns about another large British-based company being scooped up on the cheap by a foreign rival. Unilever could have ended up becoming the third major UK company to be acquired since the Brexit vote after chip designer ARM Holdings and pay-TV broadcaster Sky.Under strain ahead of negotiations with the EU, the May government has further pigeonholed itself with its tough talk on a strong industrial policy that protected British companies and jobs. Shuttling between London and Paris to deal with the fallout of a proposed Peugeot-Vauxhall deal that could see thousands of jobs shed, Greg Clark, UK business secretary, spoke with Mr Behring and Sue Garrard, head of communications at Unilever.Downing Street instructed officials to look at Unilever’s business in the UK and whether a Kraft Heinz bid would raise any policy issues, including over the future of the company’s British headquarters, its UK listing, jobs, and research and development.Back in London on Saturday, as Mr Polman tapped into his network of contacts, he was informed that Finsbury was working with Kraft Heinz on PR. Within seconds, Mr Polman blasted off an email to Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive of WPP, the advertising company that counts Unilever as one of its most important clients.Finsbury, which is majority owned by WPP, was removed from the Kraft Heinz side by the end of the day.On Sunday morning in London, people close to Kraft Heinz said the US company was determined to make a series of concessions, including taking on Unilever’s name after the merger as well as offering guarantees to maintain R&D investments and headquarters in the Netherlands, UK and the US.But Mr Behring, Mr Lemann and Mr Buffett received a letter from Mr Polman outlining his hostility to a deal. They decided then it would be better to retreat sooner rather than later. “It was a surgical decision,” said a person close to the trio. “There is little space for emotions in these circumstances.”At 5:31pm a joint statement by Unilever and Kraft Heinz put to rest any hopes of a deal. It said: Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.Although it would be foolish to rule out a 3G-inspired comeback of Kraft Heinz for Unilever, the Brazilian management cannot return for at least six months under UK takeover rules.The ultimate decision to pull the plug on the effort was made by the two key billionaires backing the transaction — Messrs Buffett and Lemann, who wanted to avoid a potentially dirty and public takeover battle.One person close to Unilever said: “From the lunch, Kraft Heinz should have got the impression that they had got it all wrong.”Another says 3G and its portfolio companies have a clever way of doing business: “Extreme aggression with a smile, so we gave them extreme rejection with a smile.”Undeterred by defeat, 3G’s Mr Lemann and his lieutenants are already planning their next move. A $15bn war chest is at their disposal, ready to hunt the next consumer goods monster.Additional reporting by Jim Pickard● January 2010 Kraft Foods, under Irene Rosenfeld, agrees to acquire UK chocolate-maker Cadbury for $19bn● October 2012 Kraft Foods splits off its snacks business into a new company called Mondelēz International to be led by Irene Rosenfeld.

112;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Who wrote the chat-up lines in Kraft’s clumsy courtship?;Advisers Lazard seemingly failed to recognise how unwanted the move on Unilever was;Would you go on a date with someone from Lazard? Fear not, this is not some new kind of new FT reader service (mind you . . . actually, no). But it is a question raised by events at the weekend — which appear to suggest that certain investment bankers can misread courtship signals.In advising Kraft Heinz to plight its troth to Unilever, Lazard seemingly failed to recognise quite how unwanted those affections were.Unilever’s very public rejection of the US group’s advances was brutal. “Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever,” wooed the cheesy orange American, even after all was lost. To which the Anglo-Dutch object of its affections pointedly refused to respond. Awkward, or what?It was akin to Mr Darcy’s “You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you” being met with “Like, whatever” by Elizabeth Bennet.Of course, Lazard did not expect the wooing to play out in public, in the manner of a botched proposal in a crowded restaurant. But surely it knew how Unilever felt, given the group’s emphatic dismissal of Kraft Heinz’s proposition at a board meeting some 10 days earlier.Close friends of the non-couple confide that Unilever felt the two business models were “polar opposites” that did not attract.They also point out that, with 60 per cent of the potential union — Unilever’s household and personal care products — offering no synergies, the partners literally had little in common.But what most appeared to gall Unilever was the idea that it was expected to cover the bill, on credit — by having debt raised against its own pristine balance sheet.And that is to say nothing of Unilever’s shrilly disapproving Westminster chaperones, who all could still remember the unpleasantness surrounding Kraft’s purchase in 2010 of lots of Cadbury’s Milk Tray.Why, then, would an adviser tell a deluded suitor: “You’re in here, mate”?One possibility is that Lazard, which understandably refused Lombard’s invitation to kiss and tell, did not have its heart in such a pursuit, but was influenced by the passionate nature of Kraft Heinz’s Brazilian backer, 3G.Last year, 3G and Lazard saw their confident wooing of brewer SABMiller, on behalf of drinks group AB InBev, prove effective.As one observer recalled: “They came to the UK with 40 per cent of the shares in their back pocket, thinking all they had to do was win on price.”And when they found their smooth talking worked, they thought they understood London courtship rituals — even though AB InBev-SAB was an entirely different combination of synergies, personalities and politics.What this past weekend has shown is that sometimes you shouldn’t pay too much heed (or fees) to your friends in the bar. Too much Dutch (or Brazilian) courage can be misplaced — and result in an embarrassing slap in the face.Vast and looseVast Resources may be many things, but vastly resourced is not one of them, writes Kate Burgess.The tiny Aim-quoted mining company, known as African Consolidated Resources until 2015, needs gazillions to develop its mining projects in Zimbabwe and Romania. And it will struggle to raise them in the market.Last year, Vast Resources’ board entered into fiendishly complicated deals with financiers allowing it to draw down cash in return for issuing warrants and convertible shares.The result was massive share dilution and a two-thirds fall in the share price. The arrangements gave Lombard flashbacks to equity credit lines at the turn of the century nicknamed “death spiral loans”, which we thought were dead. With these, the more the shares fell, the more financiers made.Vast has written to its vastly patient shareholders, professing to have learnt its lesson and saying there is “no current need to issue new equity during 2017”. A southern African investor has stepped in to lend $4m and pay a further $4m to buy half of Vast’s share of a mine.But until the business has extracted itself entirely from its southern African projects, the company still looks vastly stretched.GreenwashIt is usually politicians who try to have things both ways. But even the civil servants at the Department for Work and Pensions are at it now, it seems.In their latest green paper, they argue that it might not be desirable to have The Pensions Regulator clear takeover deals, because: “This could lead to corporate activity being delayed or even halted altogether, negatively affecting the sustainable growth of [pension scheme] sponsors.”By contrast, not having a pension check delivers sustainable growth stories like BHS, presumably. Perhaps they should have called it the Sir Philip Green paper.matthew.vincent@ft.comVast Resources: kate.burgess@ft.com
113;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-20T18:54:28Z;Unilever chief now under pressure to deliver on reforms;Seeing off Kraft Heinz bid should be ‘wake-up call’ for group, analysts say;"Relief coursed through Unilever’s riverside London headquarters on Monday after the group saw off Kraft Heinz’s $143bn takeover proposal barely 48 hours after it was revealed.Paul Polman, chief executive, who led the board’s efforts to lobby against the offer “was very determined”, says one person present at the weekend meetings.But, while Mr Polman succeeded in warding off the US group’s proposal, with the backing of some shareholders, many analysts warn that the century-old company could not simply return to business as usual.“This doesn’t mean that Unilever is out of the woods,” says Warren Ackerman, an analyst at Société Générale. “This near miss should be a wake-up call for Unilever that maintaining its independence and culture is not a given.”The pressure is now on Mr Polman to accelerate, or at least deliver, on reforms he outlined last year, which form the backbone of a three-year plan to improve profitability and growth at the UK’s third-largest company by market value.Andrew Wood, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says that despite the kudos of seeing off Kraft Heinz, “we believe that this has been a somewhat humbling and chastening experience for Polman and Unilever”.He adds: “How can a €53bn sales company — with €112bn market cap, before the bid was announced — be put under threat from a US corporation less than half its size in sales?”Unilever’s share price fell more than 6 per cent on Monday but remains higher than it was before Kraft Heinz’s interest emerged on Friday.One top-15 shareholder praises Mr Polman, whose model of long-term growth based on sustainable business practices is at the opposite end of the cost-cutting profit-driven model of 3G Capital. The private equity group, led by Jorge Paulo Lemann, the Brazilian billionaire, is the biggest shareholder in Kraft Heinz along with Warren Buffett, head of Berkshire Hathaway investment group.“Polman is doing a good job,” says the shareholder. “The Kraft Heinz model is very different — it is based on cutting costs and maximising margins, not reinvesting back into the brands.”Unilever is an unusual hybrid of food, home care and personal care businesses with no directly comparable rivals.But even Mr Polman acknowledges that the group’s operating profit margins, especially in its home care and foods business, are still too low — its core operating profit margin of 15 per cent is half that of Kraft Heinz.In addition, the company’s free cash flow conversion, of 82 per cent, is well below the average for home and personal care companies, of 100 per cent, according to Bernstein.To sharpen its performance, Unilever last year adopted three policies aimed at generating €1bn of savings by 2019, all with echoes of 3G’s practices.These include zero-based budgeting — when managers have to justify costs each year from zero — and a plan to incentivise senior managers with shares to generate a more entrepreneurial culture.First, Unilever has said it will target an improvement in its operating profit margin of 0.4-0.8 percentage points (up from 0.2-0.4 percentage points); second, it is aiming for underlying sales growth of 3-5 per cent — the actual growth rate last year was 3.7 per cent — and finally it has committed to increasing the rate at which it converts earnings to free cash flow to 90 per cent.Another consequence of Kraft Heinz’s approach could be to increase Unilever’s resolve to sell its underperforming margarine and spreads business, which accounts for 5 per cent of sales but continues to suffer from falling revenues.Some investors could also ramp up the pressure on Mr Polman to be more ambitious on M&A by seeking a large takeover, such as of the US group Colgate-Palmolive. So far his policy has centred on small bolt-on acquisitions, such as Dollar Shave Club and prestige skincare brands.Mr Polman argues that more value is generated for shareholders by acquiring small businesses and then ramping up sales.The question is whether his measures go far and fast enough. Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies says: “Fortunately, Unilever has a plan, albeit a less hair shirt one [than Kraft Heinz].”If Unilever had to go further, he says, it might consider selling more, or even all, of its food businesses, such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes.“With Unilever looking even keener to exit its spreads business but with a spinout difficult with such a weak top line, might there be a deal to be done with Kraft Heinz for either spreads or spreads plus Hellmann’s, or even the whole smorgasbord?”Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, which holds a 0.66 per cent stake in Unilever’s UK-listed shares, says: “We backed the management’s decision to reject the bid by Kraft Heinz and we have no concerns with the strategic direction of Unilever.”But he adds: “The challenge for Unilever management now will be to deliver the recently announced strategy of improving margins and above-market growth.”Additional reporting by Kate Burgess and Miles Johnson———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever● FT View: Unilever was a deal too far for Kraft Heinz

114;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-20T18:33:34Z;Unilever was a deal too far for Kraft Heinz;The world has changed, making megadeals based on cost cuts harder;Profit has many good qualities, but does not yet have the right to vote. Workers do, and politicians listen to them. So there was probably some anxiety in London and Amsterdam late last week when the news arrived that Kraft Heinz was preparing an offer for the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever, which employs 169,000 people worldwide. No minister in either capital could be under any illusion that the suitors’ plan for Unilever was anything other that cutting costs and eliminating jobs. That is simply what Kraft Heinz does, and Unilever, with margins that trail many competitors’, is a juicy target.In 2012, back when they were separate companies, Heinz and Kraft, the American packaged food companies, had combined revenues of just under $30bn, a blended operating profit margin of 15 per cent, and employed 55,000 people. In early 2013, 3G Capital, a private equity firm, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway teamed up to buy Heinz. Then, in early 2015, Heinz took over Kraft. By late 2015, when Kraft had been part of the merged company for only half a year, combined sales were down a bit, yet the margin had risen to 21 per cent. Kraft Heinz also employed about 13,000 fewer people than its predecessor companies had.Why exactly 3G and Berkshire decided to drop their approach over the weekend is unknown. Perhaps, facing firm public resistance from Unilever, they decided that the savings from buying a company only partly in the food business and based across an ocean were not great enough to justify the risks of a nasty takeover fight. It is entirely possible that neither Mr Buffett or Jorge Paulo Lemann, the leader of 3G, got a first- or even second-hand message from a government official. But political risk would have been on their minds regardless, especially given Kraft’s history in the UK. When the company bought the British chocolatier Cadbury in 2010, Kraft committed to keeping Cadbury’s plant in Bristol open. It was closed almost immediately. Britain has not forgotten.It is easy to pillory Kraft Heinz’s version of large-company capitalism as short-sighted. Indeed, it may turn out to be just that. The remarkable improvement in margins may come at the cost of long-term sales. Given Kraft Heinz’s excellent brands, this will take years to find out. Further, the history of “roll-up” companies — those that do one deal after another in an never ending quest for growth and margin — is not happy. As with Tyco 15 years ago and Valeant more recently, they tend to over-reach. Kraft Heinz probably has more discipline than either of those, yet the risks remain.The situation is not so simple, though. If Kraft Heinz has an opposite at the other end of the capitalist spectrum, it is Nestlé. The company is famous for patiently investing and reinvesting to build market positions across the globe and across decades. Even so, last week, Nestlé said that it would not be able to meet its mid-single digit growth target. It is simply very hard to grow a multinational packaged food business in the current global economy. So surely one legitimate approach is to admit that the industry is mature, focus on costs and take capital out of the business to be deployed elsewhere. The problem arises only when this approach is applied too broadly, to please markets or management teams with a short-term agenda.Equally, while all mergers should be exposed to rigorous antitrust scrutiny, governments surely should not interfere in deals simply on the grounds that consolidation leads to job losses. Down that road lies governments picking winners, crony capitalism, poor allocation of capital and stagnation. That is not to say that the wrenching character of the modern global economy does not need to be addressed. It does. The point is that government should not place all the burden in this domain on companies, especially not by blocking transactions.Pragmatically, however, companies must recognise — as Berkshire and 3G seem to have done — the world has changed. The Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump both indicate popular unhappiness with global capitalism’s hard edges. This means that governments will make life difficult for companies that make those edges particularly visible. From the point of view of global prosperity, this is probably too bad. All the same, companies that fail to acknowledge that the rules are changing will be made to suffer.Divine intervention may well have been invoked / From Peter Werdmuller, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
115;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-20T14:05:14Z;3G Capital has up to $15bn to deploy in next megadeal;Private equity group keen to do a takeover after Kraft Heinz’s failed bid for Unilever;"3G Capital, the private equity group that spearheaded Kraft Heinz’s failed $143bn bid for Unilever, has up to $15bn to deploy on its next megadeal, according to several people close to the group.3G, which frequently invests alongside Warren Buffett, is determined to identify and execute a major takeover soon following the collapse of the Unilever deal on Sunday, said two people briefed on the company’s situation.New York-based 3G has raised $10bn in its latest fund and has the option to ask investors to contribute a further $5bn, these people added.3G did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Alongside cash from veteran investor Mr Buffett and its funds, 3G typically secures large amounts of debt to finance its deals by raising borrowings against a target company’s balance sheet.This structure enabled 3G to contemplate Kraft Heinz’s $143bn bid for Unilever.Kraft Heinz is jointly controlled by 3G and Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, and the abrupt withdrawal of the US food group’s offer for Unilever was the first time the private equity company has been defeated in a takeover battle.Kraft Heinz, noting strong opposition from the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company to its bid, said on Sunday its “interest was made public at an extremely early stage. Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction.”The failed tilt at Unilever revealed that 3G is ready to expand its reach beyond food, beverages and fast-food restaurants, the three consumer sector categories in which it has grown through its investments in Kraft Heinz, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Burger King, respectively.3G-backed companies rely on acquisitions to allow them to increase their profitability since the group can impose strict cost discipline and streamline operations.Jorge Paulo Lemann, the Brazilian billionaire and co-founder of 3G, regarded the acquisition of Unilever as an opportunity to use Kraft Heinz to generate significant cost savings with Unilever’s food business, while giving the private equity group a new foothold in household and personal care businesses, said people involved in the takeover battle.The cash element of Kraft Heinz’s $50 a share offer for Unilever involved funds from 3G and Berkshire Hathaway, plus debt raised from capital markets.The other 40 per cent of the consideration consisted of shares in the enlarged company.Kraft Heinz’s bid for Unilever is likely to revive speculation the group could be interested in acquiring Mondelez International, the snack company that was split out of Kraft Foods in 2012. It has a market capitalisation of about $65bn.Bill Ackman, the activist hedge fund investor who owns 5.6 per cent of Mondelez, has repeatedly floated the idea that the maker of Cadbury’s chocolate and Trident gum should sell itself to Kraft Heinz.Kellogg, General Mills and Campbell Soup — which have market values of between $18bn and $35bn — are considered as potential acquisition targets for 3G by several analysts, who would expect any of these three to be rolled into Kraft Heinz.However, given Kellogg and Campbell Soup have capital structures that would make it hard for a 3G-backed entity to buy either company unless a deal is friendly, General Mills is believed to be a more realistic takeover target.One person who has spoken with 3G’s managing partners said recently the group has been looking at the possibility of setting up a “new platform”, which meant it could opt to acquire a company without rolling it up into Kraft Heinz.In the personal care and household products category, potential takeover targets for 3G could include Colgate-Palmolive, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox. These three all have market valuations well below $150bn, which is what Kraft Heinz would likely have had to pay to win over Unilever.———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverFT View: Unilever was a deal too far for Kraft Heinz

116;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Kraft Heinz/Unilever: nowhere men;Risk of a brawl with European governments was too daunting for Buffett and 3G Capital;A juggernaut has executed a handbrake turn. On Friday, Kraft Heinz cheerfully expected to take over Unilever for $143bn or more. On Sunday, the US food giant made a humiliating reversal. The risk of an extended brawl with European governments and the board of the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group was simply too daunting for backers Warren Buffett and 3G Capital.The investors have come to epitomise the “citizens of nowhere” style of capitalism that has helped trigger populist revolts across the globe. And while their desire, if not desperation, for conquest has not abated, it struck a discordant note at this moment in history.Unilever’s shock defeat of Kraft Heinz mars an otherwise brilliant record of striking audacious, complicated deals that have boosted shareholder returns. In 2013, the Sage of Omaha and his Brazilian counterparts acquired Heinz. Just two years later, they added Kraft. Principals at investment group 3G are no strangers to punchy deals. They are shareholders of brewer InBev, which first snatched Anheuser-Busch in 2008, grafting on UK-listed SABMiller last year.Though huge, the numbers would have been the easy part in repeating the trick with Kraft Heinz and Unilever. The takeover would have been valued at almost $170bn in total, assuming the US group raised its offer from $50 a share to $55 a share, keeping $30 a share in cash. Kraft Heinz’s own enterprise value is less than $150bn.Even if Mr Buffett and 3G together put in $25bn of equity, the deal would still have required $60bn of new debt. The new Kraft Heinz ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would have soared to 6 times, before any merger benefits. If those had produced $3bn of cost and other improvements, Kraft’s earnings per share would have jumped nearly 15 per cent.Only titanic targets such as Unilever can deliver that much payback, explaining why Kraft Heinz would even risk such a play. The group must now lower its sights to Mondelez, General Mills or some middling US food group. Its next pursuit is unlikely to implode in two days. The lesson for other companies planning vast cross-border deals in the face of rising hostility to globalisation is that politics beats economics every time.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Today, we’ve chosen Kraft Heinz’s failed approach for Unilever. Would this vast deal have made sense? Does its collapse show other cross border mega deals are doomed, given growing hostility?

117;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-20T08:17:40Z;Kraft Heinz drops $143bn pursuit of Unilever;Warren Buffett and Jorge Paulo Lemann feared public battle would have been damaging;"Shares in Unilever fell 8 per cent on Monday morning after Kraft Heinz, the Warren Buffett-backed US food group, dropped its $143bn pursuit of its consumer products rival only two days after publicly confirming its interest.Kraft Heinz said in a joint statement with Unilever that it had “amicably agreed to withdraw its proposal for a combination of the two companies”.A takeover would have created the world’s second-largest consumer goods group by sales behind Nestlé, combining brands such as Kraft Mac & Cheese and Heinz Tomato Ketchup with Unilever’s Dove soap and Magnum ice cream.The companies said: “Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard. Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.”The announcement came after a report in FT Alphaville on Friday forced Kraft Heinz to confirm it had approached its Anglo-Dutch rival about a combination to create a juggernaut in packaged foods and household items.Kraft Heinz said in a separate statement that its “interest was made public at an extremely early stage. Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction.”It added: “It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value. We remain focused on driving long-term value while always putting our consumers first.”Two people close to the talks said Warren Buffett and 3G Capital’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, Kraft Heinz’s main shareholders, decided on Sunday morning to withdraw the bid after they concluded that a protracted public battle to take over Unilever would have caused more damage than good.Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Mr Lemann’s 3G control just under 50 per cent of Kraft Heinz shares. The duo, who would have contributed significant new capital to fund the deal, were also spooked by the hostile response from UK politicians, according to one of these people.The British government had raised concerns about another large company being acquired by a foreign group in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU.Another person said the early leaking of Kraft’s interest in Unilever made it hard for the US company to negotiate a deal that would have been attractive to both sides.“Kraft Heinz was ready to make a lot of concessions, including taking on the Unilever name, to make this deal happen but unfortunately it leaked too early and that made it hard to negotiate,” this person said. Kraft Heinz was prepared to “substantially increase” its offer.Both companies began meetings with the UK government over the weekend after British prime minister Theresa May ordered senior officials to examine the proposed takeover to see if it warranted government intervention.The Kraft Heinz bid would have been a big test for the UK government’s industrial policy. Mrs May had already called for greater powers to prevent predatory takeovers, citing Kraft Foods’ 2010 takeover of UK chocolate maker Cadbury, where the acquirer later reneged on promises to retain factories in Britain.Sir Vince Cable, business secretary during the coalition government, tweeted: “Good news #kraft back off #unilever takeover. But many less famous names are sitting ducks thanks to post #Referendum devaluation.”The decision by Kraft Heinz to walk away, marks a significant victory for Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive who becomes the first consumer industry leader to defeat 3G in a public takeover battle.A deal would have brought together two companies with radically different business cultures. With a stable of slower-growing brands, Kraft Heinz is heavily concentrated in the US and was formed in the last few years through debt-laden deals.Using 3G’s approach to management, it implements aggressive cost-cutting strategies to generate margin expansion that allow it to repay the debt and bolster shareholder returns. Meanwhile, Unilever is better known for its strong brands and presence in some of the biggest emerging markets. Under Mr Polman, it has also attempted to focus on trying to better balance profitability with environmental sustainability.The company said on Friday that the $50-a-share cash and stock offer, an 18 per cent premium to its closing price on Thursday, “fundamentally undervalues Unilever”.It added: “Unilever rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever’s shareholders. Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions.”The unusually strong rejection meant the US group faced an uphill battle to strike a deal. One person close to Kraft Heinz said the US company had a cordial dialogue in the weeks leading up to the proposal, which was made about 10 days ago, and was surprised by the terse language in the public rejection on Friday.The end of Kraft Heinz’s bid for Unilever will also restart speculation over its next big acquisition target, as analysts had previously thought the US company was more like to go after targets such as Mondelez International, the snacks company, or cereals group General Mills.Unilever’s UK-listed shares fell more than 8 per cent to £34.86 when markets opened on Monday morning, having risen 13.4 per cent to £37.97 by the end of last week, making its equity worth £114bn.Kraft Heinz shares are also expected to fall on Monday. The stock had climbed 10.7 per cent to $96.65, giving it a market value of $130.2bn, as its investors anticipated the benefits of the company’s next megadeal.Unilever was defended by law firm Linklaters and bankers at Centerview Partners, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Deutsche Bank. Kraft Heinz was working with law firm Paul Weiss and bankers at Lazard.Additional reporting by George Parker———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever● Analysis: Culture clash is biggest obstacle to takeover

The shares enjoyed their best day since 1987 on Friday, when news of the potential tie-up broke.Just two days after declaring its interest, Kraft Heinz said it had “amicably” agreed to end its merger plans, sending Unilever shares down 8.6 per cent publication time following a 13.5 per cent surge at the end of last week. That puts them on course for their worst day in 2008.“Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard. Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever”, said a statement from the Warren Buffet-backed Kraft Heinz on Sunday.A takeover would have combined brands such as Kraft Mac & Cheese and Heinz Tomato Ketchup with Unilever’s Dove soap and Magnum ice cream.Unilever shares had hit their highest on record to £45.00 after confirmation of the deal following reports in FT Alphaville on Friday.

120;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-19T19:11:46Z;Kraft case showed limits to UK’s power to intervene;Unilever approach was warning shot to May after takeover pledge;The abrupt withdrawal of the $143bn bid for Unilever by Kraft Heinz has sent a wave of relief through the UK government — but the episode will serve as a warning to Theresa May after the prime minister’s pledge last year to do more to block predatory takeovers when British jobs are at stake.Immediately before she became prime minister last July, Mrs May made a speech on the economy that named two big deals: the 2010 takeover of Cadbury by Kraft Foods, and the failed bid in 2014 by US drugmaker Pfizer to buy its British rival AstraZeneca.Kraft Foods, which later split off its snacks business, reneged on a promise to retain factories and jobs in Britain.When UK companies were bought or faced closure, Mrs May said, “workers have a stake, local communities have a stake, and often the whole country has a stake”.Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch company, has 7,500 staff in the UK, based at its London headquarters and three research facilities at Port Sunlight, Colworth and Leeds.A proper industrial strategy, Mrs May added, would not automatically block foreign takeovers of British companies “but it should be capable of stepping in” to defend key sectors.The Kraft Heinz bid for Unilever had opened Mrs May to criticism that she was presiding over a fire sale of UK plc thanks to the sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote. But while Unilever is safe, it is not the only case where the UK government is having to seek details of a foreign company’s intentions — nor the only case to illustrate the limits to what Mrs May can do to intervene.The prime minister faces another challenge to UK manufacturing with plans by French carmaker PSA to acquire General Motors’ European operation Opel, which includes Vauxhall of the UK. The prime minister is due to meet Carlos Tavares, PSA’s chief executive — a renowned cost-cutter — next week as talks between the two businesses move towards a conclusion.Greg Clark, the UK business secretary, travelled to Paris last week to offer PSA, owner of Peugeot and Citroen, assurances comparable to the ones given to the Japanese carmaker Nissan, in an effort to save the Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.Vince Cable, the former business secretary, called the announcement that the Unilever bid was off “welcome news”, but added: “The problem remains that large numbers of less famous names than Unilever are in play simply as a consequence of the heavy devaluation of the currency.“There remains a strong argument for the government to tighten up the public interest test for takeovers, given the problem will recur.”Mr Cable said particular attention should be paid to deals that affected the UK’s standing in science and technology.A Number 10 spokesman said on Sunday that Mrs May was still committed to reviewing takeover rules, as stated in her speech last July. “The prime minister has said the government should be ‘stepping up, not stepping back’ where questions of national interest arise.”Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, said he was bidding “good riddance” to the Unilever deal. “The risk of asset-stripping had this takeover proceeded looked high, whilst the likelihood of this delivering long-term economic benefits for the working people of this country seemed low,” he added.Despite such calls for a stouter defence of British jobs, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has argued strongly that if the UK is serious about forging a future outside the EU as a global trading champion, it cannot intervene to prevent flows of foreign investment. “We can’t go down the Danone route,” Mr Hammond said at a cabinet meeting last October, referring to action taken by the French government a decade ago that appeared to be intended to prevent a takeover of the yoghurt maker Danone.The Unilever battle also served as a reminder of the legal constraints on the UK government. British ministers are only allowed by law to prevent foreign takeovers on grounds of national security, financial stability and media plurality. They can, however, use other policy levers such as state industrial assistance, research grants and infrastructure to try to win concessions from a foreign bidder in a takeover.The UK government’s recently launched industrial strategy includes a promised new regime to cover foreign investments in “critical national infrastructure”, although that is expected to focus on sensitive sectors, especially nuclear power.
121;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-19T18:37:57Z;Unilever chief off the hook as Kraft Heinz abandons takeover;Paul Polman faced down ambitious adversaries in buyout group 3G Capital;"Kraft Heinz abandoning its $143bn takeover proposal is a big let-off for Unilever chief executive Paul Polman, the defender of the unique culture at the Anglo-Dutch soaps-to-spreads group.Only 11 weeks ago, Mr Polman played host to scores of analysts and investors at Port Sunlight “to go back to the roots of this company [and] what made it great”.Now one of Unilever’s six main research centres, Port Sunlight in north-west England was the model village and home of Unilever founder William Hesketh Lever. More than a century ago, Lord Leverhulme, as he later became known, aimed to improve hygiene in Victorian England by manufacturing Sunlight Soap.The weight of that history hangs heavy on Mr Polman’s shoulders. The 60-year-old Dutchman’s stated goal, since taking over in 2009, has been that under his leadership, Unilever will endure for another century.Now that Kraft Heinz, backed by private equity group 3G Capital and investor Warren Buffett, has dropped its takeover proposal, Mr Polman can concentrate on his philosophy of long-term growth and sustainability at the group.Mr Polman has consistently argued — some would say preached — that the route to corporate longevity lies through responsible business practices rather than prioritising profits and investors.One of his first acts as chief executive was to tell investors that unless they bought into his long-term sustainable view of business: “don’t put your money in our company”.The second of six children, Mr Polman was brought up in a Dutch Catholic family close to the German border and displayed an early interest in business. He made pocket money selling Dutch cheese and cream to German customers, who would pay him in Deutschmarks, earning more on the exchange rates than on the products.He has spent a lifetime in three of the world’s largest consumer products group — 27 years at Procter & Gamble followed by three years at Swiss food group Nestlé before becoming the first outsider to head Unilever in 2009.He has improved the group’s profitability and transformed it into a business that now sells more personal care products than food and makes most of its sales in emerging markets.For Jorge Paulo Lemann, the founding partner in the 3G team, the withdrawal of the takeover proposal will be a bitter blow as the billionaire financier is unaccustomed to being involved in deals that unravel.Mr Lemann’s father was Swiss but emigrated to Rio de Janeiro in the early 20th century, where Jorge Paulo was born into a comfortable life. While still a teenager, he lost his father to a tram accident and has credited his mother with instilling in him an ambitious drive.His business mantra is to “Dream Big” at which he has been spectacularly successful in the beer industry, though in food Kraft Heinz has found it hard to dismiss the charge that its cost-cutting, while boosting profits, has contributed to falling sales.Mr Lemann was educated at Harvard and is a former Brazilian national tennis champion. He decided to make money in beer, after observing that the richest men in Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina were all brewers. He and his Brazilian private equity partners Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, transformed Brahma, a domestic brewer into Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest, through a series of increasingly audacious deals including last year’s $79bn takeover of the UK’s SABMiller.Mr Lemann is the biggest individual shareholder in AB InBev but stepped down from the board in favour of his son. Unlike Mr Polman, Mr Lemann keeps a low profile and rarely gives interviews, perhaps a legacy of the kidnap attempt on his three youngest children in 1999, which prompted him to leave Brazil with his family for Switzerland.At 77, Mr Lemann shows no sign of easing up. Since co-founding New York-based 3G in 2004, he has been the driving force behind the acquisitions of Burger King, and alongside Mr Buffett, Heinz in 2013 and Kraft two years later. Within 18 months of taking over Heinz, 7,000 jobs had been cut.He relies on a close-knit team of — mostly Brazilian — partners. These include Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz; Alexandre Behring, the food group’s chairman who is also a director at AB InBev and Carlos Brito, AB InBev’s chief executive.———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever● Unilever rejects $143bn Kraft Heinz takeover bid

Mr Polman believes that his focus on sustainability — the subject of his many tweets — attracts the best and brightest.Nevertheless, Mr Polman has been taking several pages out of 3G’s book. He recently introduced zero-based budgeting — when annual budgets are torn up and managers have to justify each new expense — and a new pay system designed to nudge senior managers into becoming what he has described as “mini-entrepreneurs”.Though the threat of a hostile takeover battle has evaporated, the experience may drive Mr Polman to push through harder structural changes at Unilever, including for example, selling the underperforming spreads business, a move that many investors have been calling for.Polman has shown a responsible attitude / From John Beadsmoore, Great Wilbraham, Cambs, UK"
122;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T19:53:03Z;Culture clash is biggest obstacle to Unilever takeover;Kraft Heinz’s cost-cutting ways at odds with ‘sustainable’ ideals of $143bn target;"When Paul Polman became chief executive of Unilever, the consumer goods company which on Friday rejected a $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz, he told investors to steer clear unless they were prepared to sacrifice short-term profit for “sustainable” ideals.The same message has been delivered to the maker of Kool-Aid drinks and Oscar Mayer hot dogs, with a flat rejection of a deal that would be the second-biggest in corporate history.A terse exchange of statements on Friday marks the beginning of what could become a battle of wills, pitting the evangelistic Mr Polman against the hard-headed private equity investors who two years ago swore to strip $1.5bn of costs out of the iconic ketchup maker.They are Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who cut their teeth on a series of private equity deals in Brazil in the 1980s.Their hallmarks are determination, ruthless execution and the mantra that “costs are like [finger]nails; they always need to be cut”.With the help of Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and founder of Berkshire Hathaway, their 3G Capital vehicle orchestrated a series of takeovers of US food groups, culminating in the merger of Kraft Heinz in 2015.3G’s strategy has been a private equity approach of acquiring business, cutting costs to boost profits and then embarking on a new acquisition cycle.Heinz’s operating profit margins were boosted by 10 percentage points within two years of 3G’s deal, thanks to techniques that included slashing every one of the company’s budgets to zero, and then demanding an explanation from any manager who requested an increase.“It is a radically different philosophy,” says one frequent visitor to the huge, handsome Art Deco building that houses Unilever’s global headquarters in London.Unilever was created more than a century ago out of Victorian philanthropist Lord Leverhulme’s ambition to reduce disease through manufacturing soap. Mr Polman sees himself as the voice of responsible capitalism, encouraging long-term investors and preaching the need to balance long-term sustainability with profitability.He has also presided over investments of about £1bn a year in developing the company’s product range, a decision that has helped the owner of brands including Ben & Jerry’s and Viennetta ice creams to sustain sales growth, which last year was 3.7 per cent.“[Cutting costs] might work if you’re OK with having no sales growth and making Mac and Cheese,” says a person familiar with management’s thinking. “But Unilever has brands like Magnum and Dove. You have to invest behind those brands.”Analysts say that, from the point of view of Kraft Heinz, the attractions of the deal are clear.Unilever has 13 brands with annual sales of more than €1bn, including Dove soap, Magnum ice cream, Sunsilk shampoo and Lipton tea. Most promising for 3G capital is that Kraft Heinz’s operating profit margins of 30 per cent are twice those of Unilever’s 15 per cent, offering good cost-cutting opportunities.Whereas the US group has been unable to stem revenue declines, Unilever has been selling off slow-growing food businesses and increasing its exposure to faster-growth home and personal care.Acquiring Unilever would increase Kraft Heinz’s exposure to emerging markets. It makes 75 per cent of its revenues in its home market, whereas Unilever makes 58 per cent of its sales in emerging markets.That could also help allay the fears of antitrust regulators over a deal that would combine the fourth and fifth-largest packaged food companies in the world, according to research group Euromonitor.While a combined Kraft Heinz-Unilever would leap into the top spot in food, ahead of Nestlé, it has few national overlaps, although analysts say the companies would be likely to sell a small number of business units to secure antitrust approval.Perhaps most importantly, analysts say, the Anglo-Dutch company is cheap. Until news of Friday’s takeover bid sent its shares up 13 per cent, it had been underperforming the FTSE 100 on concerns about its performance in emerging markets and Mr Polman’s downbeat outlook of a “challenging” year ahead.Sterling has fallen sharply since the UK voted to leave the EU. And Kraft Heinz, which made a $50 a share cash and stock offer, has been buoyed by the “Trump trade” — the rise in US equities in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidential election victory.While the US group may be an enthusiastic bidder, analysts say it has a fight on its hands.Unilever has a complicated shareholding structure, with a dual listing in the Netherlands and the UK, and a related class of securities traded in New York. The Leverhulme Trust, a charitable foundation that holds a sizeable portion of the stock, on Friday declined to discuss the proposed takeover deal.“The idea to be owned by those guys [3G] is revolting to management, the board and many of its shareholders,” says one person who has spoken to Unilever’s management.A higher offer might test the resolve of shareholders, however. “Kraft will likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome,” according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets. “Unilever’s focus on sustainability might make it very resistant to any further approach from Kraft.”Still, Unilever’s stern rejection of Kraft Heinz’s offer is unlikely to spook 3G and its tight knit team of advisers, who have a long-running record of closing complicated multibillion-dollar deals. Kraft Heinz has offered to establish three Unilever headquarters: in the UK, the Netherlands and the US, people briefed on the offer said.In 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev — a brewer backed by the same three Brazilians as 3G — overcame several attempts by UK-based rival SABMiller to kill its takeover approach. The management of the British group eventually caved to a slightly higher offer.While it remains unclear how much financing, if any, will come from Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor has made no secret of his intention to do more deals with 3G. He also has the firepower: Berkshire had a cash pile of $85bn at the end of September and with profits continuing to pour in from its insurance to railways business portfolio, analysts expect it to have more than $100bn by the end of this year — unless it makes a big acquisition.At Berkshire’s annual meeting last year, Mr Buffett praised 3G’s managers and defended them against a shareholder’s suggestion that they were undermining Kraft Heinz through overzealous cost-cutting. Many companies had fat that should be cut, he said, adding: “I’ve never seen anyone run things more superbly than 3G.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan, Stephen Foley, Miles Johnson, Rochelle Toplensky and Arash MassoudiPaul Polman — a man of principlesPaul Polman has a reputation as a capitalist with a conscience, writes John Murray Brown. So when the Dutchman became chief executive of Unilever in 2009, on his first day in the office he announced he was scrapping quarterly reporting, arguing that he wanted investors to adopt a more long-term mindset.“I figured the first day they hire you, they’re not going to fire you,” he told the Washington Post in 2015.Unilever’s corporate role, he said, was as that of an non-government organisation, which sometimes made him sound like Bono, the U2 vocalist and campaigner, than a typical chief executive.Unilever has a history of social activism from its foundation as the Sunlight Soap company helping improve the health and hygiene of Victorian England.But under his leadership the company launched a variety of initiatives ranging from cutting coal from its energy use to slashing the calories in its ice cream products.It was first among the world’s top 10 food companies in Oxfam’s Behind the Brands 2015 ratings for policies on land and water usage and women’s rights, putting it ahead of Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Kellogg and Mars.His thinking had evolved after a career in the engine room of some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies, including a 27-year stint at Procter & Gamble.His views on leadership are similarly straightforward. “You are not here to make friends. If you want a friend, you buy a dog. You are sitting here because you have to make tough decisions,” he told the Financial Times in an interview last September.He professes to not be motivated by money too — perhaps easy to say when you earn €10m a year.———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever● Unilever rejects $143bn Kraft Heinz takeover bid● Trading in Unilever jumped ahead of Kraft Heinz bid● Dealmaking rattles Unilever bonds● Lex: Unilever/Kraft Heinz: knives out● MPs hit out at post-Brexit ‘fire sale’ after approach for Unilever———————-"
123;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T18:49:42Z;Trading in Unilever jumped ahead of Kraft Heinz bid;Unusually high volumes in short-dated call options in days ahead of offer;Traders in the options market made large and unusual speculative investments in Unilever shares in the days before Kraft Heinz revealed a takeover bid for its rival, prompting renewed focus on suspicious trading ahead of takeover offers becoming public.Trading volumes in short-dated call options in Unilever’s US-listed shares jumped on Wednesday to the highest level since 2011, ahead of news of Kraft Heinz’s offer on Friday that sent shares in the Anglo-Dutch company surging.The activity follows a similar jump in trading in call-options in the US investment company Fortress earlier this week just one day before it announced it was being bought by SoftBank.They also echo trades that occurred in Heinz call options one day before the company was bought by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital that resulted in the US Securities and Exchange Commission fining two Brazilian brothers $5m.The timing of the large purchases of Unilever call options, which go up in value significantly when the value of the shares they are linked to rise, prompted experts to predict scrutiny of the trades by regulators.“US regulators and prosecutors frequently open insider-trader investigations based on suspicious trading activity in front of transactions that are nothing like as significant,” said Roger Burlingame, a former assistant US attorney now a white-collar defence lawyer at Kobre & Kim.Such trades will “prompt the SEC or DoJ to go and see who was behind the trade and their trading history”, he said.Henry Schwartz, chief executive of Trade Alert, an options data company, said the activity strongly indicated prior knowledge of a reason for Unilever shares to move up in the month before the options expired.“Data shows today’s bid was not a surprise to everyone,” he said. “Unusually high option volume was seen in Unilever options and Kraft Heinz beginning Wednesday.”The US Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority declined to comment on whether it was looking at the move in Unilever’s shares ahead of the announcement. Typically, it would take weeks for the regulator to act upon suspicious trades.Short-dated call options before a takeover announcement are just one red flag that authorities might look for when trying to catch insider traders.“A short-dated call option in front of a major takeover is so likely to draw attention it can show the innocent intent of a trader of any sophistication — in other words, no one who knows what they’re doing would try to insider trade in a way that would so obviously draw scrutiny,” said Mr Burlingame.Jim Strugger, head of derivatives products at MKM, however, said that it was common to see suspicious activity in options trading ahead of takeover activity.“This is an age-old situation,” he said. “You would be more hard pressed to find an announced deal where there wasn’t something shady. Pretty much every time [there is a deal] you find something that at least has a little scent about it.”
124;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T18:19:07Z;Dealmaking rattles Unilever bonds;Possibility of a multibillion-dollar takeover from Kraft Heinz spooks investors;Ambitious dealmaking can spell pain for corporate bond investors.Unilever’s bondholders were offered a reminder of that on Friday as prices for the Anglo-Dutch consumer group’s debt fell after the company rejected a $143bn takeover approach from US rival Kraft Heinz.Bonds that were sold only last week by Unilever dropped, with half the €1.2bn issue sliding 2 per cent to 98.37 cents on the euro, leaving them poised to settle below par for the first time since their sale.Older Unilever bonds did not escape either, as investors anticipated that billions more of debt will be needed to finance the deal if it happens. A €700m bond fell from 102 cents on the euro to as low as 97 cents.Although Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz’s approach, the decline in the bonds underlines the sharp effect mergers and acquisitions can have for corporate debt markets that have swelled in size during the era of easy money in the US. The corporate bond markets were also rattled after the announcement of AT&T’s bid for Time Warner and 21st Century Fox’s pursuit of Sky.“There is the initial uncertainty so the natural tendency is for spreads to widen on news of an acquisition, particularly if the acquiring company is going to be taking on more debt or if the acquiring company is more lowly rated than the target company,” said Lisa Coleman, head of global investment grade corporate credit at JPMorgan Asset Management.Kraft Heinz’s credit rating is five notches lower than Unilever’s, which investors say is likely to leave a shadow over Unilever’s bonds until the outcome of the proposed acquisition is clear. The US company said on Friday that it looked forward to reaching “agreement on the terms of a transaction”.“I doubt they will fully recover because there is still some uncertainty about whether Heinz is going to approach again,” said Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management. “The reality is from Heinz’s point of view, Unilever’s balance sheet has the capacity for more debt leverage,” he added.Ernesto Bisagno, a vice-president at rating agency Moody’s, added that the Kraft Heinz offer would be “credit negative for Unilever’s bondholders”, pointing to an increase in leverage from Unilever’s currently “moderate” levels.
125;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T18:17:47Z;Unilever rejects $143bn Kraft Heinz takeover bid;Deal for Anglo-Dutch consumer group would be second largest in history;Unilever has rejected a $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz, the food conglomerate backed by three Brazilian billionaires and Warren Buffett, setting the stage for a battle between two of the largest consumer goods companies in the world.The Anglo-Dutch company behind brands such as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream said that the $50 a share cash and stock offer, an 18 per cent premium to its closing price on Thursday, from Kraft Heinz “fundamentally undervalues Unilever”.It added: “Unilever rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever’s shareholders. Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions.”With Kraft Heinz expected to continue its pursuit, funded with fresh capital from Mr Buffett and Brazil’s 3G, both sides were preparing for a showdown between companies with two radically different cultures.Kraft Heinz was formed through debt-laden takeovers backed by Mr Buffett and the Brazilians’ New York-based private equity group, which together own 49 per cent of the company. It is known for its aggressive cost-cutting tactics.Meanwhile, Unilever has a stable of well-known brands, but sales have recently suffered in some of its biggest emerging markets, one reason why its share price has underperformed the FTSE 100 index over the past 12 months. The company is known for its focus on trying to balance profitability with environmental sustainability.Kraft Heinz has proposed maintaining three headquarters for the combined company, in the US, the UK and the Netherlands. But the approach comes at a sensitive moment for the UK, with its politicians and large businesses trying to navigate the uncertainty around Brexit.The vote to leave the world’s largest trading bloc has caused a drop in the value of sterling, making UK assets significantly cheaper for non-UK cash-rich acquirers.The Labour party MP Iain Wright, chairman of parliament’s business committee, said that the weak pound could mean “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality” by foreign buyers that “won’t have the long-term interests of the UK at heart”.If the deal were to go ahead it would make it the second largest in history, after the $183bn takeover of Germany’s Mannesmann by Vodafone of the UK in 2000, according to Dealogic.Kraft Heinz was forced to disclose its approach after a report on FT Alphaville that said the US group had made an offer to Unilever, citing people briefed on the matter. The report caused shares in Unilever to surge, prompting the statement from the US company.Kraft Heinz said it had made “a comprehensive proposal to Unilever about combining the two groups to create a leading consumer goods company with a mission of long-term growth and sustainable living”.It added: “While Unilever has declined the proposal, we look forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. There can be no certainty that any further formal proposal will be made to the board of Unilever or that an offer will be made at all or as to the terms of any transaction.”For each existing Unilever share, Kraft Heinz offered $30.23 in cash payable in US dollars and 0.222 shares in a new holding group.Shares in Unilever closed up 13.4 per cent to £37.97 per share in London on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of £113bn. It is the world’s fourth-largest consumer goods company by sales, with revenues last year of €52.7bn.Kraft Heinz shares were up almost 8 per cent in afternoon New York trading at $93.89.Many of Unilever’s top shareholders said that the bid drastically undervalued the company’s assets. Mike Fox at Royal London Asset Management, which holds a 0.66% stake in Unilever’s UK-listed shares, said that the price was “unacceptable”.“There is no way either Unilever’s management or shareholders can accept an offer at this level,” Mr Fox said. “For a lower quality business it would be unacceptable, but for a business of Unilever’s quality it is nowhere near the right price.”Unilever’s bonds also dropped sharply as jittery investors worried that Kraft Heinz’s dealmakers would leverage the Anglo-Dutch company’s strong balance sheet to pay for its bid.Under UK takeover rules, Kraft Heinz has until the close of business on March 17 to make a binding bid for Unilever or walk away for six months.The company is this weekend expected to launch a charm offensive to convince UK stakeholders that the deal would not be a repeat of the takeover in 2010 of Cadbury by Kraft Foods, where Kraft reneged on promises to retain factories and jobs in Britain.Like many other consumer goods companies, both Kraft Heinz and Unilever have been suffering from a slowdown in growth as brand-fickle consumers in mature markets increasingly turn to start-ups for more exciting new products.Earlier this week, Kraft Heinz shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since the merger in 2015 that formed the company, after it reported a fourth-quarter sales decline and said that it expected to push through deeper cost cuts.Unilever relies on emerging markets for 58 per cent of sales, more than its peers, and it is heavily dependent on them for growth.It has added premium brands and is exploring new ways of marketing to consumers.Last year, it paid $1bn to buy Dollar Shave Club, as much to increase its presence in the male grooming market as to develop the ecommerce subscription model on which the California-based acquisition is based.Kraft Heinz came together in a $100bn deal orchestrated by Mr Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital in 2015 and has been focused on driving down costs aggressively in the companies it has bought, aiming to save $1.7bn annually by 2018.Analysts have been predicting further consolidation in the industry and speculating that 3G could strike again, two years after its previous big deal, with some seeing Mondelez International as a possible target.Mondelez shares fell 1 per cent on Friday as investors discounted the chances of Kraft Heinz turning back its sights on the US-listed group.In January, Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, rattled investors after warning of “challenging” conditions in the first half of this year after a sluggish 2016.Additional reporting by Kate Allen and Miles Johnson in London and Mamta Badkar and Adam Samson in New York
126;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T17:54:40Z;MPs hit out at post-Brexit ‘fire sale’ after approach for Unilever;Concerns raised that deal would undermine UK government’s fledgling industrial policy;British politicians have warned that Kraft Heinz’s $143bn takeover approach for Unilever threatens to rob the UK of one of its best-known companies.In the latest sign that overseas corporate raiders are benefiting from the post-Brexit slump in sterling, MPs on Friday hit out over “fire sales” of British businesses that would undermine the government’s fledgling industrial strategy.Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat party leader, said: “This deal would not be happening without Brexit. The government’s industrial strategy has been completely undermined by its determination to leave the single market.”His concerns were echoed by Labour MP Iain Wright, chairman of the Commons business select committee, who warned that the Brexit-induced drop in sterling could mean “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality”. He warned that foreign buyers “won’t have the long-term interests of the UK at heart”, and suggested Unilever was now in danger of being “asset-stripped”.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, claimed Unilever was one of many groups at risk. “With sterling depreciating against the dollar and the euro since last summer, unwelcome takeover bids aimed at buying UK business assets could well increase,” she said. “This makes the need for a proper industrial strategy all the more important. At the moment all we are getting from this failing Tory government is more of the same, mismanagement and uncertainty.”A government spokesperson said the Unilever bid was “an important potential deal for a major company in the UK and its workforce” and it would monitor the situation closely.Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever is the latest in a series of cross-border deals seemingly based on the UK’s weakened currency or future trading relationships following the June referendum. Last July, SoftBank, the acquisitive Japanese conglomerate, paid £24bn to acquire iPhone chip designer Arm Holdings, the UK’s leading technology company. At the time, SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son said: “I am one of the first people to bet with a big size on the UK after Brexit.”Over the following six months, foreign takeovers of UK groups picked up, with Dealogic recording 446 deals in the second half of 2016, compared with 428 in the first half.Analysts on Friday argued that sterling weakness had been a key factor in Kraft Heinz’s calculations.“An approach for Unilever is a sure sign of the surge in dollar buying power and the decline in sterling,” said Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Investment Research. “Today’s 10 per cent rise in Unilever’s share price means this is cash neutral for a US purchaser compared with if it had approached seven months ago.”Fund managers also suggested that the bid was made possible by post-Brexit exchange rates and persistent low interest rates. Steve Clayton, fund manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund which owns Unilever shares, said: “This is cheap money meeting industrial logic.”For Unilever’s 7,500 staff in the UK — based at its London headquarters and three research facilities at Port Sunlight, Colworth and Leeds — the logic may appear less compelling.Former business secretary Vince Cable said the Heinz Kraft bid was “really alarming” and presented the government, which last month launched its new industrial strategy, with a dilemma. “Either they sit back and say Britain is open for business, which is a bit pathetic,” Mr Cable said. “Or they try to fight it, which is what I would have done.”Analysts noted that UK competition authorities have already had a bad experience of adjudicating on a bid from Kraft — for chocolate maker Cadbury — which resulted in “broken promises” on investment.Mr Wright said a takeover of Unilever by Kraft could mean “job losses and the loss of production facilities in the UK and that’s a massive concern”. The Labour MP questioned what the government could do this time to ensure promises made by any potential acquirer of Unilever are kept.He suggested an agreed bid would be “a big test” of new powers granted to the Competition and Markets Authority in the aftermath of Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury. In that deal, “promises were made and they then reneged on them, and that leaves a really bad taste”, he said.However, Mr Cable said there were mechanisms that the government could use to prevent any deal against the national interest — noting that a potential purchase of Unilever was “even bigger than Pfizer-AstraZeneca in terms of scope, and we managed to see that one off”.Additional reporting by Kate Allen
127;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Unilever bonds fall as markets weigh debt effect of possible Kraft Heinz deal;;Unilever bonds have fallen sharply this afternoon, with markets anticipating an impact on the company’s debt if an acquisition from Kraft Heinz were to go through.A €700m bond fell from 102 cents on the euro to 97 cents in early afternoon trading, before edging higher to 99 cents. The bond matures in 2028.Unilever’s bonds are moving on market expectations of the consequences of an acquisition, which could lead to an increase in the company’s overall leverage.The slight recovery in the price came after Unilever clarified its rejection of the offer of $50 per share in cash and stock.Kraft Heinz’s share price is still rising, and is 8.1 per cent up on the day. Unilever is up 11.6 per cent, slightly below the highs it hit earlier this afternoon.Senior Moody’s analyst Ernesto Bisagno said on Friday that the Kraft Heinz offer would be a credit negative for Unilever bondholders, “as 2017 pro-forma combined leverage would likely rise significantly – excluding cost savings and synergies – from the moderate 2.0x Unilever currently shows on a standalone basis.”“Also, Kraft Heinz’s current rating is Baa3 and thus five notches lower than Unilever’s A1 rating,” he added.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg
128;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T14:44:02Z;Unilever/Kraft Heinz: knives out;The deal makes sense strategically and its logic rests on cost savings;What would Lord Leverhulme, the philanthropic founder of Lever Brothers, have made of 3G Capital? On Friday Kraft Heinz, backed by the private equity group, confirmed it had presented a $143bn cash and shares bid to Unilever. The success of its overture will hinge on whether his successors will embrace a tougher version of shareholder capitalism.Strategically, the combination makes sense for Kraft. Its profits are generated overwhelmingly in the US, whereas Unilever is much stronger in emerging markets. The European company also has a position in personal goods, where margins tend to be higher. Both companies have struggled to increase sales recently.Any deal is likely to face stiff political opposition, just as bids for Cadbury and AstraZeneca did. Kraft Heinz will doubtless tout the backing of folksy investment hero Warren Buffett, who owns 43 per cent of it.But the deal’s logic rests on cost savings. Kraft would need to cut more than $3bn from Unilever’s annual costs to cover the premium offered and still enhance earnings. It would only need to get Unilever’s operating margins half way to its own level for the deal to wash its face, on current terms.Unilever has rejected those, and its shares rose 11 per cent after news of the approach. Kraft Heinz will need to offer more. Two things suggest it could. One is the possibility of fresh equity from Mr Buffett and 3G, raising its firepower. The other is its own record: Kraft Heinz’s margins before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have doubled since 2013, driven by cost reductions.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Would a Kraft takeover sacrifice Unilever’s culture and heritage for short-term gains, or would it be a long-overdue shake-up of a sleepy company?

129;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Mondelez falls as Kraft pursues tie-up with Unilever;;Mondelez shares dropped 5 per cent in early trading on Friday after Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever lessened the odds that the US group would be an acquisition target.Speculation of a potential take-over by Kraft of Mondelez was a “key factor supporting multiples for the group at such a high level,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Growe.“While this potential transaction (between Kraft and Unilever) does not count out a future acquisition … it certainly delays the potential at least a couple years,” he said.Mondelez trades at 20.6 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, a premium to 19.9 times for the S&P 500 food products industry group, and 18.1 times for the broader S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data.Mr Growe added that Kellogg, General Mills and Campbell Soup — all of which compete in the same sector — could also come under pressure as investors mull over the potential Kraft-Unilever deal.Kellogg was down 1.9 per cent in pre-market trading, while Campbell Soup shed 1.8 per cent. General Mills suffered a steeper fall of 4.6 per cent after it issued a profit warning.Kraft said early on Friday that it had made a $143bn takeover offer for Unilever, which would place it among the biggest deals in corporate history and would have significant ramifications for the sector.
130;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2017-02-17T13:28:08Z;Unilever ‘sees no merit’ in Kraft Heinz offer;;Unilever has said it has no interest in negotiating a takeover deal with Kraft Heinz, after the US group made a $143bn offer for the group.Earlier on Friday Kraft said it looked “forward to working to reach agreement” on a deal, but in a statement later in the day Unilever said it “does not see the basis for any further discussions.”Unilever confirmed that Kraft had made an offer worth $50 per Unilever share in a mix of cash and shares, but said the bid “fundamentally undervalues Unilever”.It added that it “sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever’s shareholders”.By publication time shares in Unilever had pulled back slightly from their earlier record highs, but shares were still up 12 per cent for the day, their biggest rise in almost 30 years at £37.55 ($46.73).Here’s the FT’s scoop here and FT Alphaville breaking the story this morning.
131;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

Organic net sales rose 1.6 per cent versus the year-ago period.Profits surged to $944m, or 77 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $285m, or 23 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 91 cents topped analysts’ estimates of 87 cents.The company — which came together in a $100bn deal orchestrated by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital in 2015 — has been focused on cutting costs. It aims to save $1.7bn annually by 2018, up from its previous goal of $1.5bn.Ken Goldman, an analyst at JPMorgan, said Kraft Heinz was “one of the better stories in food” but added that “it is clear in our view that Street expectations got ahead of themselves and that management’s new announcements, in particular stepped up investments at the expense of profit growth, were not welcomed by investors”.Three of the four big US equities indices found their progress checked on Thursday. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 2,347.2, receding modestly after striking a new all-time high earlier in the day.The Nasdaq Composite also slipped 0.1 per cent to 5,814.9, while the Russell 2000 index declined 0.4 per cent to 1,399.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 20,619.8.The CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s equities volatility gauge, climbed earlier on Thursday to its highest level since the end of January, but retreated later in the day to end 0.2 points lower at 11.76.The earlier rise in the measure came even as the S&P 500 has pushed to new heights this week, reflecting a slight uptick in hedging activity as traders pay close attention to Washington.The Trump administration has said it will unveil some of its business tax reform plans over the next couple of weeks — something that may include a proposal to cut the US corporate tax rate.While the Vix has ticked up, it still remains at historically low levels, according to Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI. Indeed, the average since 1990 is 19.64, according to Bloomberg data.“Investors have shown few signs of giving up on being long stocks and short volatility,” said Mr DeBusschere.Still, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned this week that “potential delays and uncertainty about the ultimate effect of the policy changes (that are expected from the Trump administration) could set markets back, at least temporarily”.

It has been the longest such run since a 63-day stretch that began in April 2014.The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market expectations for future price moves, spent much of August at the lowest levels in two years before ticking slightly higher this week.Traders and analysts suggested a variety of causes for the sideways action, including uncertainty ahead of a September meeting in which Federal Reserve policymakers could raise interest rates. In the short term, investors were holding fire ahead of Friday’s release of the US government employment report — data that could influence the Fed.“This is a big week for economic data, but it all comes in on Friday,” said Randy Frederick, vice-president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 2,170.9, with seven of its 10 main sectors in the red. Oil stocks suffered most, tracking weaker crude prices after weekly data showed US petroleum consumption declining and inventories growing.Among those hit were Murphy Oil, down 5.6 per cent at $26.72, Chesapeake Energy, off 2.5 per cent at $6.35 and Anadarko Petroleum, losing 4.1 per cent to $53.47.Materials stocks weakened as well. Mosaic, a fertiliser producer, dropped 1.3 per cent to $30.07 as investors gave back some gains from the prior day’s news that Canadian rivals PotashCorp of Saskatchewan and Agrium were exploring a merger, a move that could tighten the oversupplied potash market.Seed company Monsanto dropped after US antitrust regulators sued to block Deere, the farm equipment maker, from buying its precision planting unit. Monsanto slipped 0.9 per cent lower to $106.50, while Deere declined 1.4 per cent to $84.55.Meanwhile, food stocks strengthened after snacks giant Mondelez International this week disclosed it had abandoned its pursuit of Hershey, the US chocolatier.Analysts believe that low margins in the food business could yet usher in a wave of takeovers. Kraft Heinz rose 1.7 per cent at $89.49, JM Smucker gained 1.5 per cent to $141.79 and Hormel Foods added 1 per cent to $38.26. Mondelez edged up 0.6 per cent to $45.02 after a big jump on Tuesday, while Hershey inched up 0.2 per cent to $99.89.The S&P 500 finished August down 0.1 per cent for the month and is up 6.2 per cent since the start of the year. Howard Silverblatt of S&P said the recent period had been “boring, but not for stock pickers”, because since mid-July more than 100 issues were up at least 10 per cent and 22 were down that much.On Wednesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 18,400.9, while the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.2 per cent to 5,213.2.
135;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-08-30T18:22:07Z;Mondelez looks beyond Hershey after deal talks fail;Snackmaker still interested in acquisitions but could become a target itself;Far from being disappointed by the news that Mondelez International, which makes Cadbury’s chocolate and Oreos, has given up on buying Hershey, investors sent its shares up 3.6 per cent on Tuesday.Hershey, which sells Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, had refused to entertain negotiations without at least $125 a share on the table — far above Mondelez’s initial bid of $107.Analysts said they think Mondelez’s acquisitive chief executive Irene Rosenfeld has better options. The company is heavily focused outside the US and some investors were not particularly excited about buying a rival that was far more American at a time when consumer tastes were changing.“Monday’s release is a positive development for Mondelez shareholders, in our view,” said UBS analyst Steven Strycula. “Since Mondelez/Hershey discussions made headlines in late June, buyside feedback has been decidedly negative.“Many investors we had spoken to viewed Hershey as a distraction and deviation from Mondelez’s otherwise attractive investment case (emerging market play and margin expansion).”Hershey investors were less impressed as its shares tumbled 11 per cent to $99.50. The trust that controls the Pennsylvania-based company is in turmoil because of governance and director changes following an investigation by the state’s attorney-general. In these circumstances, many observers believe a takeover would never be approved.Mr Strycula said that Mondelez, whose shares were up at $44.54 at lunchtime on Tuesday, is trading near 20.5 times consensus 2017 earnings per share estimates, which is below the broader food industry at 22.5 times.Food and beverage companies, including Mondelez, have been through some gruelling years.While we are disappointed in this outcome, we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions …The acquisition and merger of Kraft and Heinz by 3G has shaken up the industry, by demonstrating how much profit margins can be improved through cost cutting.At the same time, brand name food producers have had to grapple with a revolution in consumer habits that has forced them to reformulate their packaged food, and buy smaller companies with healthier options while still convincing shoppers that indulgence is sometimes good.Within this environment, Mondelez appears to have three clear options now that it has pulled back from Hershey.The first would be to maintain its appetite for acquisitions and pursue other candy or snackmakers. Pablo Zuanic, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, pointed to potential combinations for Mondelez including Europe’s Ferrero, best known for chocolate, and Perfetti Van Mellem, maker of Mentos and chewing gum.The second would be to buy up smaller snack or candymakers that fit into its strategy of selling healthier products. Mondelez has promised to generate half of its sales from so-called “wellbeing” snacks, up from one-third currently, amid increasing regulatory pressure across the globe to reduce sodium and sugar in food.In her statement on Monday, Ms Rosenfeld alluded to further dealmaking ambitions.“While we are disappointed in this outcome [with Hershey], we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions, and confident that our advantaged platform positions us well for top-tier performance over the long term,” she said.Finally, Mondelez could become an attractive target for a rival, such as Kraft Heinz, a possibility that is being discussed by analysts amid speculation that 3G may be on the prowl again. Other names in the mix are cereal groups General Mills and Kellogg.Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners fund, which gained a seat on the Mondelez board, has stopped agitating for a merger with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack division, but that is a combination that still interests some analysts.$125Hershey had refused to entertain talks without at least this figure per share on the tableAlexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note to investors that “an acquisition of Hershey would delay any potential merger between Mondelez and Frito-Lay, which we consider to be a much more attractive target due to its overseas exposure.”But Susquehanna’s Mr Zuanic said that the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to be the more likely outcome. Mondelez and Kraft split into separate companies in 2012, with the former focusing on international snacking. A merger would bring the two halves back together.“A merger with PepsiCo could not be ruled out but we see that more as a long shot,” he said. “But in the end we think Mondelez will just run out of time and will be taken over by Kraft Heinz.”
136;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-08-04T20:17:31Z;Kraft Heinz: profits up but sales still down;;Kraft Heinz is proving itself adept at cutting costs — but less so at boosting sales.The packaged food giant, formed out of last year’s $100bn mega merger between Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, saw net sales drop 4.7 per cent to $6.78bn for the June quarter on a pro forma basis as the strong dollar and consumers’ ever growing appetite for fresher and less-processed food continue to put pressure on its brands.The company, whose products include Heinz Ketchup, Oscar Mayer hot dogs and packaged meats and Kool-Aid drinks, said the sales drop came despite a 1.6 percentage points increase in pricing.Currency headwinds had a negative 4 percentage point impact on net sales. But even stripping this out, organic sales fell 0.5 per cent during the period. In the US – Kraft Heinz’s single biggest market – sales were down 1.9 per cent at$4.69bn.Nonetheless investors appeared to be willing to overlook the weak sales trend in return for another big jump in profits.Net income came in at $779m, compared to a loss of $344m in the prior year period as aggressive cost-cutting once again helped fatten profit margins.Excluding one-off costs, adjusted net income was 85 cents a share, easily beating the 71 cents a share analysts were expecting. Adjusted Ebitda was up nearly 18 per cent at $2.08bn.Kraft Heinz is run by leaders of 3G Capital, the Brazilian private-equity firm best known for its ability to slash operational costs via zero-based budgeting.Management is aiming to realise $1.5bn in annual cost savings by 2017 and better than expected progress on this front has prompted the company to raise its quarterly dividend payments to 60 cents a share, up from 57.5 cents a share.
137;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-06-14T14:45:13Z;Brands push into personalised packaging;Consumer goods companies seek to emulate Coca-Cola’s ‘Share A Coke’ campaign;A 400g bag of Oreo biscuits retails for $1.99 in the US, but put the same cookies in fancy wrapping with a customised message and hey presto — customers will pay $10 for a “personalised” product.“That’s value creation, and that’s all unlocked with digital,” said Dion Weisler, chief executive of HP Inc, the personal computer and printing company.Mr Weisler was touting the virtues of digital printers on the sidelines of Drupa, “the Olympics of printing” conference that took place in Düsseldorf this month.Digital printing was developed in the 1990s, but only in recent years has the technology improved for it compete with analogue presses in price and quality.This means consumer goods companies are experimenting with personalised labelling for their products courtesy of digital printers. Think jars of Nutella, with your name on it.At Drupa, digital printing could be found on everything from personalised children’s shampoo bottles to high-end perfumes.Each brand is hoping to replicate the success of Coca-Cola’s “Share A Coke” campaign, which began in 2011 and involved HP digital printers putting people’s first names on billions of bottles and cans. Among other things, this campaign helped revive Coca-Cola’s stagnant sales in Europe.For Mondelez, the maker of Oreos, the personalised packages were its first direct-to-consumer initiative in the US. “We had a great response, including two marriage proposals — they both said yes,” said Valerie Moens at Mondelez.“Once people arrived at the Oreo [web] site, purchase conversion was three times higher than the industry average.” The project is now running in China in collaboration with ecommerce group Alibaba.Mondelez declined to comment on how it must pay for the customised packaging generated through digital printers, but an industry expert said it would be “well over double the price” compared with analogue equivalents.However, labels generated by digital printers are generally less expensive than those produced by analogue methods for jobs of less than 3,000 metres, said Bob Leahey, associate director at InfoTrends, a market research firm. For mass runs, analogue is cheaper.Short-runs are rising in popularity as brands engage in a war for shelf space by tailoring products by region, ethnic group, gender, family size and language.Digital printing remains in its infancy in packaging, but is more mature in commercial printing — producing books and magazines, for example.Last year it accounted for under 3 per cent of global printing and packaging by volume. But by value it was worth $111bn — amounting to a 15 per cent market share, according to Smithers Pira, a consultancy.Smithers forecasts growth this year of 8 per cent in commercial printing involving digital printers, but more than 20 per cent in packaging.In the most successful cases involving brands and digital printing, customers have queued to pay higher prices for special packaging.When Melbourne department store Myer offered customised jars of Nutella for A$12.95 each last December, they sold more than 400,000 across the state of Victoria and it became the top-selling item for Christmas.Ben Perkins, director of consumer research at Deloitte, said the practice of turning everyday humdrum items into personalised gifts is “quickly drifting into the mainstream”.For the moment, customers are willing to pay more for these products, but at some point they may question whether the higher costs are justified, he added.Jake Grant, analyst at BMI Research, warned that brands’ pursuits of personalised marketing campaigns were mainly short-term moves, and not a panacea to boost growth. The more the campaigns were used the less effective they might be, he added.This may explain why some brands are now using digital printing to move away from personalisation to randomisation. In Israel, 2m Diet Coke one-of-a-kind bottles were produced using an algorithm in the printing process.Among the most effective users has been Kraft Heinz. Its cream of tomato soup costs 50p in a UK shop, but customers are happy to pay £2 or £3 to send a customised “Get Well Soon” can — still cheap enough for the company to claim it costs less than a card.“The only problem is that it takes three to five days and by that time you are either well or dead,” said Sean Smyth of Smithers Pira. “But it’s the thought that counts.”
138;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-06-01T17:12:31Z;Big Food gets a salty message from the FDA;Processed meal makers under pressure to cut down sodium in recipes;Big Food is under pressure to further reduce salt in meals after US health officials released guidelines aimed at slashing sodium consumption by a third over the next decade.The US Food and Drug Administration, which issued the draft voluntary guidelines on Wednesday, said that Americans consumed on average 3,400 milligrams of sodium daily — almost 50 per cent more than existing federal guidelines.The US’s largest food companies from snack makers such as PepsiCo and Mondelez to ready-meal producers such as Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup have already had to set goals to reduce the amounts of salt and sugar in their offerings in response to a sea change in the way Americans are eating.A salty diet has contributed to around a third of Americans suffering from high blood pressure, and the FDA cited research that estimates that lowering the intake by 40 per cent could save 500,000 lives and nearly $100bn in healthcare costs over a decade.The draft plan includes a less stringent two-year target and also said that the guidelines would also include restaurants not just packaged food companies.“The majority of sodium consumed comes from processed and prepared foods, not the salt shaker,” the FDA said in a statement. “This makes it difficult for all of us to control how much sodium we consume.”While the FDA acknowledged the efforts of the big food companies in making changes to their recipes, it said that “many foods continue to contribute to high sodium intake, especially processed and prepared foods, including foods eaten away from home”.Americans are placing more emphasis on the quality of what they eat, demanding more wholesome, natural foods containing fewer unnatural ingredients used in additives and preservatives. In July, Vermont will be the first US state to introduce mandatory labelling of genetically modified ingredients. These shifts have been helped by the spread of social media, which has amplified consumer voices in the debate.“This is clearly a step in the right direction on a pretty big issue,” said Alexia Howard, a food company analyst at Bernstein. “What tends to happen is that the food companies’ wheels will start to turn ahead of this before the voluntary guidelines actually come into effect.”Analysts said that it was too early to tell the extent to which the proposed guidelines would impact food companies, but those most likely to be affected were the makers of soup and baked goods.The Grocery Manufacturers Association said it welcomed dialogue with the FDA on the issue and claimed the industry had reduced sodium levels by 16 per cent between 2008-2013.However, it stopped short of endorsing the draft guidelines, saying that: “We believe additional work is needed to determine the acceptable range of sodium intake for optimal health. This evaluation should include research that indicates health risks for people who consume too much sodium as well as health risks from consuming too little sodium.”Mars, the family-owned maker of pasta sauces and chocolate bars, said that the draft guidelines would not mean the company would be forced to accelerate its commitment to reduce sodium in its foods by 20 per cent over the next five years.Mondelez said it would review the proposed targets as they relate to its product portfolio, noting that it had pledged in 2010 to reduce sodium and had a plan to decrease its use by 10 per cent across all products by 2020.The FDA is providing 90 and 150 days for public comment on the two- and 10-year targets respectively.
139;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-05-17T20:14:40Z;US stocks fall on Fed rate rise expectations;;The S&P 500 wiped out Monday’s rally and the Nasdaq Composite fell the most in more than a month amid growing speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise rates as early as next month.Data on Tuesday showed that consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent last month — the biggest gain since February 2013, while US manufacturing expanded for the first time in three months.Elsewhere, Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, said recent inflation readings had been “encouraging” while early signs pointed to growth rebounding from a soft first quarter, meaning that June should be a possibility for a move.With that in play, futures prices suggest traders see a 14 per cent chance of a move at the June meeting, and a 29.5 per cent chance in July, according to Bloomberg calculations. That is up from the 4 and 19.4 per cent chances the futures market saw on Monday.The S&P 500 consumer staples sector led the decline on the benchmark index, falling 1.9 per cent led by a 4.3 per cent drop in shares of Kraft Heinz. Nine of 10 major sectors on the S&P 500 finished the day in the red with a rally in oil prices, helping the energy sector remain in the green.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite logged its biggest one-day drop since April 7.
140;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-05-06T20:09:08Z;S&P 500 logs second straight weekly drop;;US stocks reversed their losses on Friday after the latest data showed the economy added fewer than expected jobs last month, but it wasn’t enough to keep the S&P 500 from posting its second consecutive weekly lost.Data on Friday showed the US economy created just 160,000 jobs last month prompting analysts to abandon their calls for a rate rise by the Federal Reserve in June.The S&P 500 finished the day in the green but posted a 0.4 per cent decline for the past five trading days. That also marked the S&P 500′s longest weekly losing streak since February.Consumer discretionary stocks led the advance on the benchmark index, rising 1.6 per cent for the week — and one of just two sectors to post a weekly gain. The advance in the sector was led by Kraft Heinz, which reported stronger than expected results on Wednesday, taking its weekly gain to 7.5 per cent, leaving it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 energy sector, which has been among the biggest gainers so far this year, posted the biggest drop this week, falling 3 per cent.Meanwhile, bearish sentiment returned to the oil trade with Brent crude, the global oil marker, declining 6 per cent over the week to $45.27 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US crude marker, posted a 3 per cent fall to $44.57 a week.
141;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-04-12T17:53:12Z;Corporate winners and losers amid the oil price crash;Airlines are beneficiaries of cheap fuel but consumer goods groups are not getting a big boost;Oil price crashes have profound consequences. The fall in crude after the 1997 Asian financial crisis ushered in today’s oil and gas supermajors after a flurry of megamergers that included BP’s tie-up with Amoco, Exxon with Mobil and Texaco with Chevron.The latest collapse in oil is having an enormous impact — even though the benchmark Brent price has rebounded in 2016, it is still about 60 per cent down since mid-2014.Oil and gas: Debt fears flare upRosneft runs to stand stillSaudi Arabia loses oil shareUS oil and gas sector reboots to surviveOil price: ‘Shot in the arm’ misses economic targetBut the consequences of this oil decline have not been the ones that history might suggest would occur, either within or outside the oil industry.Thousands of jobs have been axed as rigs have been idled and investment slashed across the sector.However, with the exception of Royal Dutch Shell’s acquisition of smaller rival BG Group, there has so far been nothing like the wave of large deals that followed the late 1990s oil downturn.That is because this downturn was preceded by a period of virtual “free money” following the 2008 financial crisis, says Tony Hayward, chairman of Glencore and former chief executive of BP.“Much of the industry was massively overleveraged in a way it wasn’t in 1998 and 1999,” he adds, and that is leading to bankruptcies in the US shale industry, and preventing consolidation.But what of the rest of the corporate world?Conventional wisdom says cheap fuel is good news for airlines, makers of gas-guzzling cars, and other companies able to produce or ship goods less expensively for shoppers with wallets fattened by lower pump prices.Conversely, a low oil price is supposed to be bad news for power generators using renewable energy and electric carmakers.But the reality has been more complicated in an oil price rout that has been deeper and longer than many experts predicted, and is happening in a world that has changed considerably since previous crashes.One of the biggest differences between the latest oil price downturn and past declines is the way consumers have responded to the extra cash in their pockets coming from cheaper fuel.Moody’s says lower oil prices will not translate into the expected strong spending on some consumer goods because many people are focused on saving.Expectations have failed to match reality in many parts of the power sector, too, thanks to the pronounced changes the industry has experienced since previous oil crashes.For one thing, the oil-fired power plants that generated as much as 18 per cent of global electricity in 1980 now produce about 5 per cent, so lower crude prices do not threaten wind farms and solar parks as much as might be imagined.The number of countries with renewable energy targets has soared from just 73 in 2010 to 164 in 2015, data from the International Renewable Energy Agency show.That is one reason the oil rout has failed to dent healthy annual growth in renewable power-generating capacity.Sales of fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles have jumped, but government incentives have to some degree protected the much smaller electric car industry.Monthly sales of electric cars and other vehicles in the US have fallen since the oil price started to decline in mid-2014, but they have risen in Europe, according to figures from Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm.For consumers, lower oil prices mean less expensive petrol, leaving more money in their pockets to spend on other items, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.This increase in disposable income is, in theory, good news for consumer goods companies — selling food, soap powder and toiletries — which also gain from lower fuel costs. But the reality is more nuanced.Consumers in oil-importing countries, such as India, benefit. But Sarah Solomon of Euromonitor International says those living in oil-exporting countries like Russia “are seeing their economies squeezed. Added to this, many emerging markets are experiencing currency weaknesses and this increases import costs, pushing up inflation, which can more than offset lower energy prices.”Unilever said in January that lower oil prices were helping its laundry business through reduced input costs, but hindering the sales growth of bulk tea, much of which is sold to Middle Eastern countries.Finally, as Ms Solomon points out, consumers do not necessarily spend the savings they make on lower energy bills. Globally, savings as a percentage of disposable income increased slightly in 2015.Moody’s said last month it now expects the effect of low oil prices on US packaged food companies, such as Kraft Heinz, to be “moderately positive” instead of “strongly positive”.Brian Weddington of Moody’s says: “Consumers have remained cautious spenders, which has resulted in heavy price competition . . . Thus, we expect that companies will reinvest much of the cost savings from cheaper fuel in promotions and marketing to at least maintain sales volumes.”Airline executives finally have a smile on their faces. After seeing fuel become their single biggest cost in the era of high oil prices, carriers are now celebrating the plunge, writes Tanya Powley.But while airlines are natural winners, how quickly they can reap the full benefits from cheap oil has varied significantly across the industry.This largely comes down to an airline’s hedging contracts. Fuel typically accounted for about one-third of carriers’ operating costs before the oil rout, and many airlines opt for the predictability that hedging oil purchases several months forward allows.US carriers, which are generally less reliant on fuel hedging, have enjoyed the biggest boost so far from cheap oil.Executives at American Airlines will be lauding their decision to abandon hedging in 2014, which has enabled it to enjoy lower fuel costs faster than many rivals. This contributed to record net profits for 2015.In January, Delta Air Lines said its fuel costs for last year were down 44 per cent compared with 2014.European airlines have had to be more patient. Both flag carriers and budget airlines on the continent tend to hedge 12 to 18 months out, so some have had to wait until this year to secure big benefits from cheap oil.“Most large European airlines are starting to see major benefits now,” says Oliver Sleath, analyst at Barclays. “They’re moving from paying an average effective rate of $90 to $100 a barrel in 2015 down to $60 to $70 a barrel in 2016.”The axing of investment projects by oil and gas producers has taken its toll on manufacturers that count energy companies among their most important customers, writes Michael Pooler.The energy sector accounted for one-third of corporate capital expenditure globally in 2014, but investment cuts will shrink that share to a quarter by 2017, according to Standard & Poor’s.In the US, the fortunes of the energy and manufacturing industries are particularly intertwined. This is highlighted by how the US manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, a measure of the sector’s health, started falling when the oil price began declining in mid-2014.“Oil has generally been a leading indicator for industrial confidence in the US,” says Matthew Spurr, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Once manufacturers realised we were in the lower-for-longer scenario, the PMIs started to reflect that.”Those affected include Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction machinery. Cheap commodities contributed to a 15 per cent fall in revenue in the company’s 2015 results, with the effect of lower crude prices hitting its unit that supports drilling and well servicing.The oil price collapse is also reverberating in South Korea, the world’s biggest shipbuilding nation. Its three giants of the industry — Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering — have recorded much reduced orders for energy platforms and drill vessels.Elsewhere, an expected lift for chemicals companies that make their products from oil derivatives has largely not materialised.This is partly due to reduced demand for chemicals in the energy industry, says Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein.Falling oil prices have led to a boom in sales of large, fuel-hungry cars, writes Peter Campbell.In the US, Europe and China, sales of sport utility vehicles and so-called “crossover” cars have outpaced traditional saloons.Large vehicles have higher margins for carmakers, and are also attractive for consumers because they offer better visibility and more storage space.SUVs became the best-selling type of car across Europe for the first time last year, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm, after sales rose 24 per cent to 3.2m units.SUVs accounted for 22.5 per cent of all cars sold in Europe, with demand rising in the 29 countries analysed by Jato. More than 1m crossover cars were sold last year.“Similar to the shift towards SUVs in the US car market, Europeans are clearly favouring these vehicles,” says Felipe Munoz, an analyst at Jato.“Both economic and social factors such as the lower fuel prices and the growing appeal of SUVs’ benefits had a big influence on this sales boom.”Between 2010 and 2014, unit sales of SUVs rose from 12 per cent of the Chinese market to 23 per cent.In the UK, several big manufacturers have seen demand for large cars rise in recent years.In February Jaguar Land Rover said the Range Rover Evoque, the luxury compact SUV built in Halewood, Mersyside, was the fastest-selling vehicle ever.Last month Nissan expanded production of its Qashqai crossover at the company’s Sunderland plant, after saying that annual output of 300,000 cars was not enough to meet rising demand.Tumbling oil prices have hurt the biofuels industry around the world, writes Pilita Clark.The sector’s fortunes depend heavily on government support for renewable fuels in most countries. But where crude prices go, biofuels generally follow, so the oil rout has had a negative impact on the industry.“It’s been significant,” says Claire Curry, analyst at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research group.In the US, the biggest biofuels producer, ethanol prices have fallen from nearly $3.50 a gallon since mid-2014, to less than $2 this year. Ethanol is usually blended with petrol for use in cars and other vehicles.The shares in some large US biofuels companies have followed a similar path to ethanol prices. For example, the stock of Green Plains of the US has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year.In Europe, Germany’s CropEnergies, one of the sector’s larger producers, suspended output at its Ensus refinery in the UK just over a year ago.That contributed to an 11 per cent decline in CropEnergies’ revenues during the first three-quarters of its 2015-16 financial year, but has helped ease concerns about too much capacity in the industry.The sector’s woes have also paved the way for some consolidation.For example, last year Pacific Ethanol of the US bought Aventine Renewable Energy, an Illinois-based ethanol producer.Global investment in biofuels had already dried up before oil prices began to fall, plunging from more than $25bn in 2007 to well below $5bn in 2014, as governments curtailed their support.This is the sixth part of a Financial Times series entitled ‘Oil: Lower for Longer’, looking at the consequences of the fall in crude prices.
142;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-04-04T16:17:38Z;Food stocks: different baskets;The sector is a defensive play, with a notable exception — Kraft Heinz;It has been a nauseating ride. The S&P 500 index, since mid-2015, has traced a lopsided W: starting at 2100, breaking below 1900, back to 2100, 1900 again, and back up past 2000 again now. Stomachs have been calmer among owners of defensive stocks and packaged food, in particular, has been a good bet. Tyson is the best performing S&P stock since last August. Hormel, Campbell Soup and Post are not far behind. Nearly every food stock trades at close to 20 times earnings, good and frothy by historical standards.The high valuations are not mysterious. People will eat, so revenues will be stable. Big food companies generate cash, too. Free cash flow yield above 3 per cent is the norm, to go with a little bit of sales growth. This makes an appealing place to hide money when the 10-year treasury yields less than 2 per cent.It would be dangerous, however, to think that all food stocks are the same. Consider, for example, Kraft Heinz, the biggest of the lot, with an enterprise value of $125bn. It has the high valuation to match its peers but cash flow is a bit below average and sales growth, retrospective or prospective, is scarce. Instead, it is a margin expansion story. In the fourth quarter, its operating margin was over 24 per cent, a meaty 9 percentage points higher than it had been a year before. Analysts estimates have margins hitting 29 per cent in 2017.The expectation of further margin expansion is striking given that the company’s profitability is already far and away the best in the industry — where the average operating margin is in the mid-teens. Maybe 3g Capital, the firm of cost-cutters behind the Kraft Heinz deal, have created some special sauce.How far costs can be cut before the top line suffers in the food industry is an open question, though. Owning most food stocks is a bet on consistency. Kraft Heinz is a step into unknown territory, potentially profitable, but hardly defensive.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
143;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2016-01-14T06:02:26Z;Mergers on the menu for food and drink industry;Rivals left playing catch-up after $62bn ketchup maker deal between Heinz and Kraft;"For those who like putting ketchup on their macaroni and cheese, the $62.6bn takeover last year by Heinz of Kraft — purveyors of the American pasta staple that comes in a blue box — will have been a winning combination.But for the growing number of consumers who are turning away from packaged food, the merger was a defensive one, aimed at addressing low sales growth by cutting costs in order to make two of America’s best-known, but ultimately tired, brands more profitable.Saving $1.5bn a year, the merger will shed 5,000 jobs, or 10 per cent of the combined workforce, and close seven manufacturing plants.Kraft Heinz, as the combined company is known, has already made financial sense for some of its investors, notably Warren Buffett. In November, the head of Berkshire Hathaway investment group, reported a $4.4bn windfall from the deal.He worked with 3G Capital, the private equity group co-founded by Brazil’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, the driving force behind the growth of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, on a buyout of Heinz in 2013. The two then moved on to consolidate Kraft in March 2015.The merger was one of the largest M&A deals last year and the biggest in food, signalling a trend towards greater consolidation among large, legacy food brands, especially among companies in the US such as General Mills or the Campbell Soup Company.“For the US, M&A activity will continue to be robust as companies continue to look for sales growth and margin improvement,” says Diane Shand, senior director at Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency. “Moreover, the Kraft and Heinz merger sets a precedent for larger cost-cutting programmes and further consolidation in the industry.”Within developed economies, food M&A is being driven primarily by the changing tastes of younger consumers, who are shunning processed food in favour of natural, healthier and more local products. The growth of this segment of the market has been fast, in contrast to that of most large packaged food companies.According to OC & C, a consultancy, revenue growth of the world’s 50 biggest food companies slowed to 1.7 per cent in 2014, from 2.9 per cent in 2013 and from 5.6 per cent in 2012.As FX (François-Xavier) de Mallmann, global co-head of consumer retail and healthcare at Goldman Sachs, says: “We expect consolidation to accelerate, especially in the US, where a number of legacy brands and categories are growing less fast. Capital markets and, in selected cases, activists, are putting pressure on these companies to manage their cost base more efficiently and increase cash flow generation, which many believe can be better achieved through greater scale.”The Kraft and Heinz merger sets a precedent for larger cost-cutting programmes and further consolidation in the industryA second driver of M&A activity is larger food companies’ appetites for innovative start-ups, as the former forage for faster-growing revenue streams in the grocery aisles. The demand has made younger companies highly sought after and pushed up their valuations sharply.General Mills, best-known for Cheerios breakfast cereal and Pillsbury dough, bought Annie’s, a packaged food group that uses organic and natural ingredients, in 2014; Coca-Cola last year took a minority stake in Suja Juice, an organic juice-maker, and Hormel, the producer of Spam, paid $775m last year to acquire Applegate Farms, an organic processed meats producer.In Europe, Unilever, which makes Lipton tea and Flora margarine, has developed a taste for premium ice cream to add to its Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s brands. It made two recent purchases: Talenti, a Minneapolis-based upmarket sorbet maker, and Grom, the Italian ice-cream maker that says it does not use flavouring, colouring, preservatives or emulsifiers.Akeel Sachak, global head of consumer at Rothschild, says that the changing preferences of the millennial consumer explain this new-found enthusiasm on the part of multinationals to enter the natural and organic food market. “This has hitherto been mainly the preserve of hippy-type entrepreneurs from California and a select band of visionary larger consolidators such as Hain Celestial and WhiteWave,” he says.Companies such as Hain, which owns the Linda McCartney vegetarian brand, and WhiteWave have been growing partly through acquisition of organic and natural food companies. Hain, a New York-based group with a market value of $4.1bn, last year acquired Mona Group, a European company that makes soy and nut-based drinks. This followed its acquisition of Rudi’s Organic Bakery, a Colorado-based producer of gluten-free products.WhiteWave Foods, based in Denver, has followed a similar strategy. The owner of the Silk and Alpro plant-based milks, paid $550m last year to buy Vega, which produces plant-based snack bars and powdered shakes.Food is still relatively fragmented compared to beverages or homecareA third M&A driver is specialisation — becoming bigger in one category — a strategy being pursued in coffee by JAB Holding, the billionaire Reimann family’s investment group. JAB, which also owns the Coty cosmetics business, offered $13.9bn in December 2015 to acquire Keurig Green Mountain, maker of coffee systems, in the US. The deal will make it the main challenger in the coffee capsule market to Switzerland’s Nestlé, which owns Nespresso.Low interest rates, economic recovery and still buoyant stock markets suggest that 2016 will be another strong year for food deals. These factors made 2015 a record year for global dealmaking, with $4.6tn of activity across all industries.Michael Collinson, managing-director of European consumer and retail at William Blair investment bank, sees no reason for M&A activity to taper off, especially given the appetite among private equity groups for food assets.“Food is still relatively fragmented compared to beverages or homecare,” he says. “It’s a much more accessible market to private equity, partly because of the size of the companies and the valuations paid.”"
144;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2015-11-10T05:03:51Z;Bloated US food and beverage sector needs a new bliss;US food and beverage companies are facing tremendous upheaval as consumers shun processed products;In his book Salt, Sugar, Fat, Michael Moss recounts a food industry meeting in 1999. A room full of chief executives listened to a speech on how their companies were being blamed for their contribution to rapidly rising rates of obesity in the US and what they could do to alleviate the problem.Fast forward a decade and a half from that meeting, at which the executives apparently chose to ignore the speaker’s recommendations, and the industry is experiencing tremendous disruption in the face of consumers who are increasingly shunning processed foods and carbonated drinks in favour of healthier fare.This upheaval has forced many food and beverage companies, from Kraft and Heinz through to General Mills, Campbell Soup, Kellogg’s, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, to reassess their place in corporate America. This quest sometimes comes with a shove from private equity firms or activist investors, eyeing such companies’ vulnerability and ripeness for reducing excess costs.Nearly three years ago, 3G Capital, the Brazilian cost-cutting king, took over Heinz, which was established in 1876. Earlier this year Heinz merged with Kraft to create Kraft Heinz. Activist investors have been circling the industry, pushing, and often achieving, intense efficiency targets. The message is clear: find new relevance or say goodbye to your independence.This is where longevity comes in. US companies may not be as old as some European or Japanese companies, but this does not mean they do not deserve the badge of longevity.Some have been around since the early 1800s. They have endured tremendous tumult: the civil war, the Great Depression, two world wars and numerous developments in technology and consumer behaviour, globalisation, oil shocks and the recent global financial crisis. The very fact that they still exist means there is a tremendous amount to learn from them.Campbell Soup’s roots go back to 1869, the same decade as the abolition of slavery in the US. Coca-Cola was invented in 1886. McDonald’s, though established at the much later date of 1955, is still considered a company with history. That is particularly true when considering that the “characteristic” age of a company listed on a US stock exchange is just eight years, according to research by Credit Suisse, the bank.But as Jim Collins, author of best-selling books such as Good to Great and Built to Last, says, you cannot really have longevity without greatness. “It is about enduring at a high level. Just hanging on isn’t any good,” Collins says.He argues that it is not enough for a company to have a long life because it is winning financially. It needs to be missed if it were to disappear, and the company’s raison d’être should not vanish when the founder leaves. To achieve this it has to be able to continue innovating by constantly challenging itself and setting intimidatingly lofty goals to withstand the sands of time and not drown in them.Mars has managed what many family-owned companies have not: it has reached the fourth generation. Victoria Mars, the current chairman, is the great-granddaughter of Frank Mars who, with his son Forrest, invented the Milky Way — the chocolate bar, that is. Succession planning is a serious matter at Mars, starting 15 years in advance. Every member of the family, with or without direct business involvement, is engaged in the process. Victoria Mars said in a recent interview: “[It is about] getting the whole family to understand what this legacy is that we have and what is the responsibility that comes with that. [In general] it is not the business that is going to be the problem, it is the family that causes those problems.”Financial success and innovation are inextricably linked. Without innovation it is difficult to keep the consumer on board and, as a result, profits will be elusive. Apple is a classic example. The late Steve Jobs took Apple from near bankruptcy to being the most valuable company in the S&P 500, thanks to inventions such as the MacBook and the iPhone that convinced shoppers across the globe they could not live without them.It is harder to do this in the food business. Technological advances that remove food further from its natural state are unlikely to grab the interest of consumers who want to buy healthy and fresh products. The push in the US for labels that identify genetically modified organisms is a case in point. And the bigger and more diverse the company, the less of an impact inventions have on profit.When food companies started out, they were hugely innovative, launching an era of processed meals that claimed to free up mothers’ time, while snacks and fizzy drinks claimed the hearts of children and adults across the nation. Advertising helped make brands such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, M&M’s, Oreo, Campbell Soup, Oscar Mayer and Cool Whip household names.With McDonald’s, Ray Kroc managed to give Americans the ultimate fast-food experience from the mid-1950s, with an attention to detail and an insistence on freshness that is hard to imagine as the company struggles with its current image of serving unhealthy food.A lack of in-house innovation coupled with a shift away from core products has left many older companies looking for acquisitions, buying what they do not have: organic and fresh products. General Mills has been buying companies such as Annie’s, which makes organic food for children. Other companies end up just merging with each other.Looming over the industry is the shadow of 3G, whose unsympathetic cost-cutting has become an industry benchmark, and whose thirst for acquisitions appears unquenchable. This has left many chief executives with an uncomfortable dilemma: face a takeover bid from 3G or face it as competition.Either way, it is a difficult choice. And while cuts are needed at many companies, it is doubtful that they and bolt-on acquisitions alone can propel a company far into the future, particularly if the most innovative people are let go in the name of saving money.Deere is a Midwestern company that transformed US agriculture through innovation in tractors and ploughs, and stands today as one of the world’s largest manufacturers of farm machinery.The company’s roots go back to 1837 when blacksmith John Deere developed a polished-steel plough. He quickly expanded into retail and based his business in Moline, Illinois, which is still its base and which is now reliant on the company for much of its economy. John Deere gave Moline its first bank and was mayor for two years, but was also at pains to understand its customers. An article in a 1936 Fortune magazine says Deere’s salesmen “not only speak the farmer’s language but speak it with his twang”.It is people that make the business, and part of feeling valued and motivated is the understanding that one’s employer wants to create something previously thought unattainable. It is about being given the freedom to try, fail and hopefully succeed.Good communication from the top is paramount. “Communication with the employees, making sure they know why they and the company are valued and the realisation we can be great together, that is when a company sustains,” says Mary Kier, who has written on corporate longevity and recruits top executives as a managing director of ZRG Partners, a headhunting firm.Without the inspiration of innovation, a company will struggle to be significant. For better or worse, many of America’s biggest and oldest food companies grew out of tremendous innovation in the field of processing, and finding the so-called “bliss point” of the ultimate combination of sugar, salt and fat to create cravings.Innovating around moderation and health instead of excess is no easy task. But for more and more companies, including some US corporate survivors, this is the path to not only remaining relevant, but deciding what is relevant.
145;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2015-08-11T00:03:37Z;Kraft and Heinz sales fall short pre-merger;Investors expect big things from Buffett-3G Capital partnership;Kraft Heinz said that revenues in the final quarter before their merger dropped at both companies, as investors cast a keen eye on the performance of the latest Warren Buffett-3G Capital partnership.America’s third-largest food and beverage company said revenues in its Kraft unit dropped 4.9 per cent to $4.5bn, short of analyst expectations, because of lower volume and prices.However, the business posted earnings per share of 92 cents, a 15 per cent increase year on year and ahead of market estimates, thanks in part to an asset sale and unrealised gains from hedging activities, the company said on Monday.Bernardo Hees, chief executive, said the company was “focused on the difficult and challenging process of integrating our two businesses. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us as we continue to design our new organisation.”Kraft Heinz was created on July 2 out of the combination of the two companies, which produce some of the biggest processed food brands in the US — in some cases, such as Heinz Ketchup, across the world.The second-quarter results are the first reported by Kraft Heinz since the merger. However, the date of the tie-up means that the companies were still separate during the three-month period.Investors are expecting big things from the combination. 3G has proved it can slice large costs off companies it controls, and its success at improving operating margins at companies it has taken over has made them a benchmark for rivals in the food sector.Under a consumer revolution in taste preferences and demand for value, the industry is being forced to spend more wisely, cut costs and introduce products that fit demands for healthier foods with more natural ingredients.Heinz was taken over by the Buffett-3G partnership in 2013. In a sign that it is still being streamlined in a tricky macroeconomic environment, second-quarter sales dropped and the company fell into a deeper loss.Heinz reported a loss of 91 cents a share, compared with a 14 cents-a-share loss a year ago, on a 4.1 per cent drop in sales to $2.6bn. With much bigger overseas operations than Kraft, Heinz was hit hard by the strong dollar. It also divested a UK business.However, excluding extraordinary items, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 6.7 per cent to $739m, thanks to better pricing in North America as well as cost cuts, the company said.Kraft Heinz produced unaudited results showing combined earnings for the quarter. These showed a fall in revenue to $7.1bn from $7.5bn, and a decline in net income to $390m from $494m.Kraft Heinz said it was “confident” it would meet its estimates for the merger, including cost cuts of $1.5bn by the end of 2017.Its shares fell 2.3 per cent in after-hours trading to $76.99.
146;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2015-08-06T18:13:10Z;Pressure on Mondelez to take a bite out of costs;Example of 3G offers Bill Ackman a menu for more ambitious targets;"Oreos can be consumed in a single bite these days, thanks to the introduction of Oreo Thins. But Mondelez International, maker of the chocolate and cream biscuit, may need to bite off a bigger chunk out of its costs, following news on Wednesday that Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square fund had built a 7.5 per cent stake in the food group.It is not the first time that Mondelez, and its chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, have faced pressure from activist investors to cut costs. Early last year, the company allowed Nelson Peltz on to its board to make a case for savings, after he abandoned his public push for the company to merge with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack business.Mondelez has since pledged to improve its operating margin, adjusted for extraordinary items, to 15-16 per cent, and drive further expansion after reaching that target. It has two $1.5bn cost-cutting plans: one focused on making its supply chain more efficient, which will end next year; and another aimed at both supply chain and overhead cost-cutting, to be achieved by 2018. As part of these, it has been slashing headcount and implementing “zero-based budgeting” where all costs have to be approved anew each year.So far, the plans have been working. In the first half of 2015, Mondelez’s adjusted operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 13.4 per cent, Bernstein estimated. Investors appear pleased: the shares are up 28 per cent year-to-date, compared with the S&P 500’s 1.4 per cent gain.However, peers in the food industry have already proved costs can be cut far more dramatically — and from a less flabby starting point.In April, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestlé, said the purchase of Kraft by Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital, showed how costs could be “pulverised”.“3G’s partners are known in our industry for ruthless cost-cutting and have already proven numerous times that they are capable of reducing operating costs in particular by between 500 and 800 basis points, which has a revolutionary impact on all the other members of the industry,” he noted.Even though Mondelez has been meeting its cost-cutting targets, Pershing Square reckons these could be substantially more ambitious — partly because Mondelez is a relatively new company. It was itself created from a split from Kraft in 2012 and reflects 15 years of acquisitions — from Nabisco, to Cadbury to Danone’s biscuits business — which Mr Ackman’s fund does not think have been fully integrated.Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, points out that after 3G bought Heinz in 2013, it managed to improve the company’s operating margin by 700 basis points, which was more than twice Mondelez’s own ambitions at the time. At one point, she says Mondelez had more than 100,000 suppliers, which would have been more than one supplier for every employee.“There is massive margin opportunity [for Mondelez],” Ms Howard said.In recent years, the food industry has undergone massive upheaval as changes in consumer tastes and demands have forced the likes of companies from Mondelez to Coca-Cola to reassess their place in the global consumer market. Many have had to win over new consumers among the emerging middle classes of China, Africa and India.For Mondelez, this has meant increased marketing expenses, making its cost-cutting measures elsewhere more important.But other analysts believe Mondelez has scope to race ahead with further cost cuts, while still expanding its business thanks to the strength of its brands.Erin Lash of Morningstar estimated that if Mondelez can drive out $2.5bn in annual costs starting in 2020, or nearly 10 per cent of the company’s cost of goods sold and operating expenses — which would be similar to the Kraft Heinz target — it would generate operating margins approaching 20 per cent.“If Kraft-Heinz ultimately makes good on its aims to extract costs, management at other industry bellwethers, including Mondelez, will need to fall in line or risk being taken out,” she said.Mr Ackman knows both Ms Rosenfeld and 3G well, and the threat is that if the former is not able to achieve the cost cuts he wants, then the latter might be induced to make a bid and do that work themselves.The ironic endgame here could be that, after only a few years separated from Kraft, Mondelez could be brought back into its fold under the cold embrace of 3G."
147;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2015-08-06T04:28:26Z;Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman seizes 7.5% Mondelez stake;Activist aims to force the US food group to slash costs or put itself up for sale;Bill Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager, has seized a 7.5 per cent stake in Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury’s chocolate and Trident gum, in an attempt to force the food group to slash costs or put itself up for sale.The stakebuilding marks the second time in three years that US-based Mondelez has had to contend with an activist, following agitation by Nelson Peltz for the company to merge with PepsiCo’s snacks arm.Hedge funds have been attracted to the food sector amid a wave of consolidation and a willingness by some of the biggest operators to radically cut costs to juice shareholder returns.Mr Ackman’s bet is that Mondelez, which has a market capitalisation of $73bn, can be pushed to go further in its restructuring than plans already announced. The company has introduced zero-based budgeting, where managers build budgets from scratch and justify each expense.An alternative course envisioned by the hedge fund manager is that Mondelez could sell itself to Kraft Heinz, the food group being rolled together by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital of Brazil. The two investment groups jointly owned Heinz, which acquired rival Kraft earlier this year.A takeover by Kraft Heinz would essentially reverse a 2012 deal that split Mondelez and Kraft into two companies, the former an internationally focused snack company, and the latter a US-focused processed foods group.Mr Ackman and his fund, Pershing Square, refused to comment beyond a statement confirming its 7.5 per cent interest. The stake, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, has been built through a mixture of shares, futures contracts and options.*Mondelez said: “We welcome Pershing Square as investors in our company. We’ll continue to focus on executing our strategy and on delivering value for all our shareholders”.Mr Ackman knows both Irene Rosenfeld, Mondelez chief executive, and 3G Capital well, putting him in a unique position to play them off against each other.Pershing Square was an investor in Cadbury when Kraft launched a hostile bid for the chocolate maker in 2009 and Ms Rosenfeld, then chief executive of Kraft, stoked controversy in the UK by backing away from an apparent promise not to close Cadbury factories.The hedge fund is also an investor with 3G in Burger King, another food company where the Brazilian firm has installed management to impose cost cutting and zero-based budgeting.Mondelez and other US food groups have been grappling with a revolution in tastes at home, where consumers are embracing healthier eating habits and more natural ingredients.This has triggered consolidation among some companies while others, whether beverage makers like Coca-Cola or snack makers like Mondelez, are adapting recipes, cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Mondelez’s relatively strong second-quarter earnings announced last week sent its shares higher.Mr Peltz dropped his demand for the Pepsi merger last year to focus on pushing for cost cuts and Mondelez gave him a seat on its board.*An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect breakdown of the mix of shares, futures and options acquired by Pershing Square.
148;KHC;Kraft Heinz Company;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
