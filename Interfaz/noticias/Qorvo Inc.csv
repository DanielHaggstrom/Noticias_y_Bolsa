But the unseasonably warm weather also took a toll because of the brand’s exposure to sweaters and outerwear.The report also showed that Gap did not receive much support from its other brands. Comparable sales fell 9 per cent at Banana Republic and 2 per cent at the Gap brand.Total same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 5 per cent in December, worse than analysts estimates for a 3.9 per cent decline.The retailer, which has faced increasing competition from fast-fashion retailers such as H&M and Zara, has relied on the strength of the Old Navy brand during its turnround, and its disappointing December figures have delivered a blow to its share price.“Our worst fear was that Old Navy would underperform significantly and that’s happening,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst at FBR. “If Old Navy starts to go downhill, then all bets are off on a company turnround.”Gap shares fell more than 40 per cent last year.Shares in The Container Store dropped 41.1 per cent to $4.22 after the purveyor of storage items issued a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook and received an analyst downgrade.The Texas-based company said it expected earnings in the range of 19 to 22 cents a share, below estimates for 29 cents. Meanwhile, it expects same-store sales to decline between 3 and 5 per centThe news came alongside disappointing third-quarter results. The retailer swung to a loss of $1.7m, or 4 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.2m, or 13 cents a share in the previous year. Sales rose 3 per cent to $197m. This missed analysts forecasts for earnings or 5 cents a share, on sales of $200.3m.“At a time when the consumer’s willingness to invest in the home is high, The Container Store has struggled to gain traffic and comp store sales,” Daniel Binder, an analyst at Jefferies, said. “We believe this reflects increased competition in the home furnishings space, which may require more aggressive tactics if The Container Store wants to stem share loss.”An analyst downgrade only served to exacerbate the retailer’s woes. Analysts at JPMorgan cut the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and removed their price target.Shares in Qorvo fell 2.5 per cent to $44.49 after the chipmaker lowered its revenue guidance for the fiscal third quarter late on Thursday. The Apple supplier said it now expected December quarterly revenue of about $620m, compared with its previous expectations for $720m to $730m.This was also below analysts’ forecasts for $723.8m. The news comes at a time when concerns are mounting about weakening demand for Apple’s iPhones.Despite a robust US job report, markets were weaker by the close of trading on Friday after a dismal week of losses on China slowdown fears.The S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,922.03, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 1 per cent to 16,346.45 and the Nasdaq Composite shrunk 1 per cent to 4,643.63.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
1;QRVO;Qorvo Inc;2015-11-06T17:46:17Z;Chipmakers and banks lead Wall Street;Broad market slips after solid employment figures point to tighter central bank policy in December;Chip manufacturers Qorvo and Nvidia rallied with US banks on Friday as Wall Street digested a blowout employment report for October.A $1bn share buyback plan and adjusted earnings beat announced after market close on Thursday helped make Apple supplier Qorvo the biggest S&P 500 riser in morning trading.Qorvo shares were up 19.4 per cent to $53.88, with Nvidia’s stock also boosted by higher than expected third-quarter profits.Nvidia reported earnings per share of 44 cents, well above market estimates for 24 cents per share, leading analysts at Jefferies to move their price target up to $38 from $34. The launch of virtual reality headsets will give further momentum to the stock, they argued.“We think as the ecosystem rallies ahead of the official launches of Oculus Rift, HTC’s Vive, and PlayStation VR, this raises awareness of the secular forces favouring Nvidia and improves sentiment for the stock,” they said in a note.Nvidia was up 14.1 per cent to $31.62. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions jumped too on better than expected adjusted earnings, with shares up 7.4 per cent to $86.22.The gains were in contrast to broad weakness in equities following the release of job figures that heightened expectations of a December rate rise by the Federal Reserve.Financials and information technology were the only sectors to gain as the benchmark S&P 500 index slid 0.4 per cent to 2,091.38.Rising rates indicate higher bank profits as the gap between the amount they charge borrowers and the bank’s own cost of borrowing tends to increase. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan all rose more than 2.7 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,830.70, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was flat at 5,127.98. Implied equity volatility, as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index, rose from 15.05 to 15.29.TripAdvisor weighed on the S&P after missing on adjusted third-quarter profits and revenues late on Thursday. The travel booking site reported adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents, shy of the 54 cents expected by the market, and also lowered expectations for the fourth quarter, citing an accelerated investment in new products.Shares fell 9.6 per cent to $75.16 as analysts at Credit Suisse nudged their price target down one dollar to $82.“While this is a sharper-than-expected downward reset to our near-term estimates, we are willing to underwrite what is effectively an investment to improve the conversion rate and ultimately increase the value of TripAdvisor’s ad inventory,” said the analysts.Weight Watchers continued to bulk up after beating on earnings and raising its full-year guidance. Shares in the dieting brand jumped 36.3 per cent to $28.08 and are now up 240 per cent since mid-October, when Oprah Winfrey endorsed the business and bought a 10 per cent stake.Investors less keen on dieting pushed Monster Beverage Corp shares up 14.4 per cent to $151.34. The owner of energy drink brands such as Monster Energy and Relentless beat on sales and earnings on Thursday.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
