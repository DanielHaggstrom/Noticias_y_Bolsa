Accusing the defendants of “countless attempted delays and diversions”, the organisation praised the judge for allowing the trial to go forward.“Now it’s time, through the bellwether trial for Summit and Cuyahoga counties, to shed light on the actions of the remaining opioid defendants in that litigation [that is] opioid distributors and a manufacturer — in the first federal trial that begins on Monday,” it said in a statement.Opioid makers and distributors are facing mass litigation from US states, counties, and cities seeking to recoup some of the costs of the crisis, which has led to mounting healthcare and law enforcement bills. Two million Americans are suffering from opioid use disorder, according to the Center for Disease Control, and the outbreak of overdoses has contributed to a drop in US life expectancy.The companies, which all deny responsibility for the crisis, did not respond to requests for comment.Shares in the defendants fell in after-hours trading in New York. Teva Pharmaceuticals, the only remaining manufacturer, fell 1.6 per cent to $7.38, after losing 3.5 per cent during the trading day. Drug distributor stocks also dropped: Cardinal Health lost 3 per cent to $50.02, McKesson fell 3.1 per cent to $147.56, and AmerisourceBergen was down 1 per cent to $89.64.Other opioid makers were also brought lower by the news. Even though they have settled the cases with these particular bellwether counties in Ohio, they face other lawsuits related to the crisis.Endo International, which settled these cases for about $10m, was down 2.4 per cent to $4.76, and Mallinckrodt, which settled the two cases for about $30m, fell 3 per cent to $2.66. Johnson & Johnson, which settled with the two counties for $10m, was up slightly after-hours, after losing 6 per cent to $127.70 during the day, due to investor concerns about a recall of one batch of its talcum powder.Judge Dan Polster met with executives from the defendants on Friday, in an attempt to form a deal before the trial starts on Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the week that the distributors had offered about $18bn to settle, while The New York Times said the deal would include the distributors, Teva and Johnson & Johnson, and would be worth about $50bn in cash and addiction treatments.As well as the total value of the deal, the sides have been debating over what period the payments should be made and the split between cash and in-kind payments.

2;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2016-01-11T22:18:29Z;McKesson slides on generic drugs unit weakness;Energy companies under pressure amid sharp decline in price of oil;McKesson slid on Monday after the healthcare supply chain company warned over weakness in its biggest unit.The San Francisco-based company cut the top end and raised the bottom end of its adjusted profit outlook for the year ending in March and said it expected bottom-line growth of 7 per cent to 12 per cent the following year.The 2017 outlook trailed Wall Street forecasts, which call for a 12.6 per cent increase.McKesson said the gloomier forecast comes due to “weaker generic pharmaceuticals pricing trends”.The pharmaceuticals distribution business overall accounts for about 95 per cent of the company’s revenues, according to Bloomberg data.The trend in generics is “partially offset” by a cut in McKesson’s corporate tax rate, the company said.McKesson’s shares skidded 10.33 per cent to $163.55 by the close.The shares have tumbled 23.4 per cent over the past 12 months.Celgene, a large US biotechnology company, said it would promote chief operating officer Mark Alles to chief executive as Bob Hugin moves to an executive chairman role. It also said it expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.50 to $5.70 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $5.67 a share.The shares dropped 5.46 per cent to $103.03.Under Armour came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the stock to “underweight” from “equal-weight”.The analysts said the sportswear company was “losing market share for the first time in three years in apparel, and more surprisingly, [average sales prices] are falling at an accelerating pace”.The shares slid 6.72 per cent to $69.96, cutting their 12-month gain to about 3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan dropped as copper prices sold off by more than 2 per cent. The company’s credit rating was cut by Fitch Ratings after the market closed on Friday to triple B minus, from triple B.The rating agency said the move reflected its view that the “commodity prices recovery will be prolonged”.Freeport is one of the world’s biggest copper miners and has taken a beating as the price of the industrial metal has fallen by more than a quarter in the past 12 months.Its shares fell 20.33 per cent to $4.31, extending their decline over the past year to 80 per cent.Many energy companies came under pressure amid a sharp decline in the price of crude oil. Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 7.05 per cent to $9.62 a share.Meanwhile, Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure company, fell 7.98 per cent to $18.69.General Motors shares rose after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.The investment bank said worries that the global automotive cycle had peaked after a blistering year for sales were “overstated in the near-term”.The US carmaker’s shares climbed 2.44 per cent to $30.25. They were down about 16 per cent over the past 12 months.By the close, the S&P 500 had nudged up to 1,923.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 0.3 per cent to 16,397.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was about 0.1 per cent down at 4,637.63.
3;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2015-09-18T14:15:57Z;McKesson buys UDG Irish unit for €407.5m;All-cash pharmaceuticals deal is second European move in weeks;McKesson Corp, the acquisitive US pharmaceuticals group, has continued its European expansion with the €407.5m purchase of UDG Healthcare’s Irish drug business.On Friday, McKesson — which is best known in the UK for owning the Lloyds Pharmacy chain — said UDG had agreed to a sale of its Irish supply chain services business and UK travel health business in an all-cash deal.Shares in Dublin-based but London-listed UDG rose 6 per cent after the announcement. Liam FitzGerald, the company’s long-time chief executive, also informed investors that he would retire next March, and be replaced by Brendan McAtamney, UDG’s chief operating officer.McKesson’s purchase of the UDG businesses represents its second move into the UK and Irish retail drugs market in a matter of weeks. In late July, it agreed to buy J Sainsbury’s 281 in-store pharmacies for £125m. It is aiming to expand rapidly across the EU, having bought Celesio, the German drug distribution group, at the beginning of 2014 for $8.6bn, including debt.Peter Gray, UDG’s chairman, said the sale of the drug distribution business, formerly known as United Drug, will leave the group more focused on higher-margin operations.UDG’s distribution business accounted for just over half the total revenues of €1.1bn for the six months to last March, but had an operating margin of just 2.2 per cent, compared to an operating margin of 10 per cent in the group’s other divisions. After the disposal, UDG will consist of packaging, marketing services and medical devices distribution businesses.“It gives us the resources to continue building our higher-margin, higher-growth divisions,” Mr Gray said. He argued that the assets being sold would be better utilised in a global group such as McKesson.UDG plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt, and will have about €100m in cash on the balance sheet when the transaction closes.Mr FitzGerald said UDG had long recognised that it did not have the scale to be a significant force in the global pharmaceutical distribution business. McKesson, with annual revenues of $180bn, is many times bigger.However, he added that the focus for the company’s remaining businesses — especially its Ashfield marketing services business — would be on expansion through acquisitions. Future deals are likely to be focused on the US, Japan and Europe.When he became chief executive in 2000, the company’s operations were mostly in Ireland, whereas now it operates in 20 countries.
4;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-12-18T19:21:07Z;Oracle on fire after success in the cloud;US stocks bounce back on gains for tech and battered energy;Oracle shares soared to their highest level since 2000 — the year the dotcom bubble burst — after the Silicon Valley company offered the most convincing evidence yet that it is adapting to the radical change in the way corporate customers buy software.Although Oracle’s revenues edged up just 3 per cent and profits dipped last quarter, the share price was electrified by signs of progress in its cloud computing division.Oracle is one of an older generation of software companies, including Microsoft, that built their fortunes selling annual software licences to business customers.That model is now threatened by the emergence of cloud computing, in which companies such as Oracle host software applications online and businesses pay for it as they use it.Richard Davis, a technology analyst at Canaccord, said Oracle was starting to convince Wall Street that it was serious about competing in the cloud.“We believe investor opinion on Oracle’s stock, which in our conversations ranges from indifference to dislike, will change for the better,” Mr Davis saidOracle’s cloud revenues surged 45 per cent to $516m in the quarter to November 30, persuading its famously competitive co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison to declare that its cloud revenues would eclipse those of rival Salesforce.com next year.Shares of Oracle climbed 9.3 per cent to $45.35, their highest level since September 2000.Rite Aid shares jumped 12 per cent after the US pharmacy chain raised its profit forecast for the year.The company said it expected full-year profit to be between $315m and $370m and revenue to be between $26.25bn and $26.4bn.The news came just three months after Rite Aid was forced to lower its guidance as generic drugs squeezed profitability at its core pharmacy business.The latest guidance puts earnings closer to the $298m-$408m level the company set out at the start of its fiscal year in June.Rite Aid, the third largest drugstore chain in the US, said while margins at its pharmacy business are still under pressure — they fell 228 basis points during the third quarter — higher prescription sales and a new agreement with McKesson, its main supplier, which lowered its drug purchasing cost, had helped take out some of the sting.Shares in Rite Aid, down 15 per cent over the past six months, rose 72 cents to $6.78 compared with a low of $5.39 at the start of December.Shares in convenience store operator The Pantry added 3 per cent to $36.44 after its Canadian rival, Alimentation Couche-Tard, swooped on the company in a deal worth $1.7bn including debt.The move will consolidate its position as one of the largest convenience retailers in North America.The two companies said they had agreed to a definitive deal under which Couche-Tard will acquire The Pantry for $36.75 per share in cash, a 27 per cent premium to The Pantry’s closing price on December 16, when reports of a potential tie-up first emerged.Hertz shares rose 6 per cent to $22.55 after Carl Icahn, the rental car company’s largest shareholder, raised his stake in the company to 11.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent.Mr Icahn revealed a stake of just under 8.5 per cent stake in Hertz in August and has since seen the departure of chief executive Mark Frissora and won three board seats at the company.Gains in the technology sector and a steadying of the battered energy industry underpinned a climb in the S&P 500 index of 2.4 per cent to 2,061.2 by the end of the US session. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.2 per cent to 4,748.4.
5;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-07-31T17:33:27Z;Stocks: the value is out there;The trick is in seeing where the overvaluation lies;The problem, we are assured, is localised. Yes, reliable measures of valuation for stocks – as a group – are elevated. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio is a fluorescent 60 per cent above its 130-year average. Q, which compares stock prices to the replacement value of company assets, has been higher only in 1929 and 1999. Profits as a proportion of US output – a measure that the competitive logic of capitalism implies must be mean reverting – is at postwar highs on an after-tax basis.But Janet Yellen, Fed chairwoman, called out shares only in social media and biotech as stretched. And strategists echo the message: pick your sectors and your stocks carefully and you can protect capital.What look like value stocks are still out there. Kellogg’s earnings report on Thursday was middling, but it generates solid returns, has a non-terrifying forward earnings multiple of 15, and yields 3 per cent. But overvaluation is emphatically not restricted to a small number of sectors. Of the constituents of the S&P 500, 69 have seen their share prices double in the past two years. Some of Ms Yellen’s targets are on the list: Celgene, Netflix, Facebook, Biogen Idec. But is Goodyear Tire an emblem of the new economy?Another example: McKesson, a famously well-managed company in the old-fashioned drug distribution industry. Its shares have gone from $90 to $190 over two years. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 12 to 18 over the same period (its trailing ratio is at an all-time high). Analysts expect EPS growth averaging 18 per cent a year for the next four years. Can McKesson do it? Sure. Does its valuation leave room for error? None whatsoever.There are plenty of other examples just like this one. This locality is getting awfully big.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
6;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-05-22T11:49:40Z;Magnetar Capital sues McKesson over Celesio deal;;McKesson is being sued by a hedge fund which claims that the US drug distributor’s purchase of Germany’s Celesio was unfair to minority shareholders.Magnetar Capital, which owned over 3 per cent of Celesio when the deal was struck in January, filed a lawsuit in Frankfurt on Wednesday alleging that the German company’s smaller shareholders should have been offered nearly a third more in the takeover deal, which valued Celesio at $8.6bn including debt.The complex takeover led to McKesson and Celesio’s majority shareholder, family-owned German company Haniel, scrambling at the start of the year to find a fresh deal to create one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical distribution groups after an initial offer fell through at the start of January.At issue was a convertible bond partly owned by activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which also owned shares in Celesio. The dilutive impact of the bond meant that McKesson was unable to secure the 75 per cent of Celesio shares it needed before the deadline in its original offer.The first offer had initially been opposed by Elliott, which built a big position in Celesio while arguing McKesson’s initial €23-a-share offer was too low.A deal was then struck for Haniel to buy Elliott’s convertible bond then sell it to McKesson. But Magnetar argued on Wednesday that the price paid for the convertible bond valued Celesio’s shares at €30.95, rather than the €23.50 offered to other shareholders in the deal.The hedge fund calculates that McKesson should have paid an extra €370m to Celesio’s minority shareholders and bondholders.“If McKesson’s transaction is allowed to stand without addressing the divergent prices paid to different shareholders, this precedent would upend safeguards designed to ensure fair treatment of all shareholders in corporate takeovers in Germany,” Magnetar said in a statement.Magnetar complained to the German regulator BaFin in January that the second offer violated the so-called minimum price rule, which demands that all shareholders be offered the same price for their stake within a certain timeframe.But the hedge fund was told it was not the German regulator’s role to enforce particular claims and that it should pursue its grievance in the civil courts, according to one person familiar with the deal.“McKesson does not comment on pending litigation,” McKesson said. “We followed all relevant German laws in our transaction, and we launched our recent tender offer, after concluding agreements with Haniel and Elliott, with full approval from German securities regulators [BaFin].”BaFin said that it did not intervene with third party shareholder disputes in takeover offers, pointing out that shareholders could pursue their claims in a civil court if they felt their offer was unfair.The Celesio deal was closely watched in financial circles in Germany because of the unusual sequence of offers. Under German takeover law, a second bid after a first bid fails is not normally allowed within a 12-month period. Bankers have also suggested the deal paved the way for fresh activism in German companies, where large family-owned stakes in companies are more prevalent than in other countries.
7;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-01-24T00:09:54Z;McKesson finalises Celesio takeover;;McKesson, the US drug distributor, has won its hard-fought takeover of Celesio in a deal that values the German pharmaceutical group at $8.6bn, including debt.McKesson said on Thursday evening that it had secured ownership of close to 75 per cent of Celesio’s shares after striking an agreement with German investment company Franz Haniel to acquire its stake.The US group also confirmed it would buy convertible bonds in the company owned by Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund, which amount to about 8 per cent of Celesio’s stock.The deals mean McKesson can now enter into a so-called domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with Celesio, allowing it to wrest control of Celesio and gain access to its cash flows.McKesson did not disclose the terms of the deal with Elliott. However, people familiar with the situation said the drugs group had paid a “significant premium” for the convertible bonds.The takeover was initially opposed by Elliott, which rapidly built a big position in Celesio while arguing McKesson’s initial €23-a-share offer was too low.The hedge fund, which is growing in stature as one of America’s most energetic activist investors, eventually agreed to sell to Haniel last week when McKesson raised its bid to €23.50 a share.“It is a fair assumption to make that Elliott would not have made so much noise about getting the price of the deal bumped by €0.50 if there was not a premium for the other part of the deal [purchase of convertible bonds],” said a person familiar with the structure of the agreement.Haniel agreed to sell its stake to McKesson last October in a deal to create one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical distribution groups. The family-owned group has been eager to broker a deal to sell Celesio as it looks to make fresh investments in Germany. The sale will leave German retail giant Metro as the largest holding in the Haniel portfolio.Stephan Gemkow, chief executive of Haniel, said on Thursday that “the two companies are an excellent fit, and I wish them – and especially their employees – every commercial success.”John Hammergren, chief executive of McKesson, said the increased scale and improved supply chain efficiencies would benefit his customers.Additional reporting by Alice Ross, Anousha Sakoui and Andrew Ward
8;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
9;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-01-20T21:41:17Z;Elliott increases stake in Celesio to 24%;;Elliott Associates, the activist hedge fund, has increased its stake in Celesio to more than 24 per cent, days after an $8.6bn takeover of the German drugs wholesaler collapsed.The move could herald an attempt to salvage a deal with McKesson, the US pharmaceutical distributor, whose planned acquisition failed to secure enough shareholder support to go ahead last week.New York-based Elliott now owns shares equivalent to 24.08 per cent of voting rights in Celesio and a further 7.93 per cent through convertible bonds, according to a filing to the Frankfurt stock exchange on Monday.This would make it easier for McKesson to reach the 75 per cent shareholder approval needed for a takeover if agreement was reached with Elliott and Haniel, the German family-owned investment company which controls 50 per cent of Celesio.Haniel agreed to sell its stake to McKesson last October in a deal that would have created one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical distribution groups.The takeover was initially opposed by Elliott, which rapidly built a big position in Celesio while arguing McKesson’s €23 a share offer was too low.The hedge fund, known for its aggressive approach to boardroom battles, eventually agreed to sell last week when McKesson raised its bid to €23.50 a share.However, the combined stakes of Elliott and Haniel were not enough to clear the 75 per cent approval threshold set as a condition of the deal.Stephan Gemkow, Haniel chief executive, appeared to hint that the deal could be revived when he said: “It is a pity that the takeover has failed for the time being.”Analysts said it was possible McKesson would make another bid because of its desire to establish a European bridgehead as the industry consolidates.Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, has forged alliances with Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen of the US over the past two years, putting pressure on Celesio and McKesson to find transatlantic partners.“We believe the pressure for a deal is increasing with further tie-ups in global drug procurement, and Celesio and Phoenix [another German-based wholesaler] are the two remaining sizeable EU assets available,” said James Vane-Tempest, analyst at Jefferies.On a fully diluted basis, Haniel and Elliott are believed to own about 41.8 per cent and 27.1 per cent of Celesio, respectively, according to analysts.McKesson could buy out Haniel and Elliott once the pair reached a combined 75 per cent holding, triggering a mandatory bid for the remaining shares, the analysts added.The Elliott stake disclosed on Monday was as of January 13, raising the possibility that the fund has bought further shares in the subsequent week.Elliott and McKesson did not respond to requests for comment. Haniel declined to comment.Additional reporting by Alice Ross in Frankfurt
10;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-01-14T13:53:36Z;McKesson / Celesio: on-off affair;Deal for medicines distribution group fails, but may well be revived;"Romantic ardour can be self-defeating: sometimes we don’t get what we want simply because we want it so badly. So too, it seems, in business. McKesson’s $8.3bn offer for Germany’s Celesio had the backing of buyer, seller, executives, boards and key shareholders. It ticked all strategic and operational boxes. Yet it failed to convince the required 75 per cent of Celesio’s shareholders, who are among the losers in this minor transatlantic tragedy.Start with Elliott Management, a hedge fund which built up roughly a 23 per cent stake in Celesio after McKesson’s approach and squeezed a slightly higher offer from the bidder. McKesson may have assumed that getting Elliott on board by bowing to its demand for a bit more money would be enough to clinch the deal. If so, it was a fatal error. It appears that McKesson had acceptances for no more than 67 per cent of Celesio’s fully diluted equity last Thursday (Elliott owned shares and convertible bonds, as do other Celesio investors).It may be that McKesson thinks Celesio is not worth more than €23.50 a share. But a hint of trouble ought to have been detected when the shares touched €24.50 in the past few days. Everybody – McKesson, Celesio, Elliott, Citi (adviser to Celesio) and Goldman Sachs (adviser to McKesson) – looks to have been just too clever by half.The biggest loser was the Haniel family which owns 50.01 per cent of Celesio. The collapse of the deal has not, presumably, changed its desire for cash. One option might be for the US company to buy the Haniel stake. Another is a joint venture.These are second-best options for both companies. McKesson is big enough to plough on; Celesio is too small to compete effectively. A third-party bid for Celesio looks unlikely, unless private equity is tempted. A break-up is always an option. For the moment, though, McKesson and Celesio still look fated to be partners.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
11;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-01-13T20:54:23Z;McKesson bid for Celesio fails due to lack of investor support;;McKesson admitted defeat in its $8.6bn bid for Celesio, the German-based medicines distribution group, after a battle with Elliott Associates, the activist hedge fund, over the deal.The US drugs wholesaler said it had failed to reach the 75 per cent acceptance threshold among Celesio shareholders required for the acquisition to go ahead.McKesson raised its bid last Thursday after an initial offer was rejected by Elliott, which had built a 25 per cent stake in the German group.The US hedge fund, known for a succession of high-profile corporate showdowns, agreed to sell part of its stake at the increased price but its lukewarm support was not enough to carry the deal over the finish line.Failure of the acquisition represents a blow to McKesson, which planned to use it as a bridgehead for European expansion, and to Haniel, the German family-owned investment company which had agreed to sell its 50 per cent stake in Celesio.“McKesson would have been a very good partner,” said Stephan Gemkow, Haniel chairman and head of Celesio’s supervisory board. “Thus, it is a pity that the takeover bid has failed for the time being.”However, Celesio said it was “strategically very well positioned” to remain competitive as an independent company.Elliott had previously called for the company to consider a break-up leading to the sale of its wholesale and pharmacy businesses to separate buyers.John Hammergren, McKesson chief executive, said he was disappointed but added: “We . . . will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to further strengthen our businesses through our disciplined approach to capital allocation.”Celesio, based in Stuttgart, has 132 wholesale branches that supply 65,000 pharmacies and hospitals in 14 countries, mostly in Europe. It also operates the Lloyds pharmacy chain and reported sales of €22.3bn in 2012.A takeover by McKesson would have created one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical suppliers and accelerated consolidation of the drugs distribution market after Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, forged alliances with Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen of the US in the past two years.Mr Gemkow said the failure was “not the end of the world” and Haniel would now “calmly analyse the situation and consider all options”.Haniel had planned to use the €2bn it would have received from the deal to invest in smaller companies within Germany, leaving its 30 per cent stake in Metro, Germany’s largest retailer, as its biggest holding.McKesson made a “best and final” offer of €23.50 a share on Thursday, up from an initial €23, valuing the company at €4bn, or €6.3bn including debt.Elliott responded by saying it would sell part of its stake – accounting for about 15 per cent of Celesio shares – but that still left McKesson relying on small shareholders to reach the 75 per cent acceptance threshold.McKesson joins a long line of companies scarred from confrontation with Elliott, run by US billionaire Paul Singer, whose adversaries have ranged from the Argentine government to Wm Morrison, the UK supermarket chain. Elliott on Monday declined to comment.
12;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2014-01-09T15:25:17Z;Elliott brinkmanship over McKesson $8.6bn bid for Celesio;;Elliott Associates, the activist hedge fund, has agreed to sell part of its 25 per cent stake in Celesio to McKesson after the US drugs wholesaler lodged an increased $8.6bn bid for the Germany-based medicines distribution group that controls Lloyds pharmacy.Haniel, the family-owned German investment company, has also agreed to sell its 50 per cent stake in Celesio, but people close to the situation said on Thursday it was “not yet a done deal” ahead of the midnight deadline for shareholders to accept.McKesson had earlier lodged a “best and final” offer of €23.50 a share in a bid to overcome opposition from Elliott, which had rejected its original €23 a share offer.Elliott responded by saying it would sell part of its stake – accounting for about 15 per cent of Celesio shares – but this still left McKesson relying on small shareholders to reach the 75 per cent acceptance required for the deal to go ahead.The hedge fund’s brinkmanship will further burnish its aggressive reputation after high-profile investor battles in recent years with adversaries ranging from the Argentine government to National Express, the UK transport group.Elliott acquired its stake in Celesio after Haniel agreed to McKesson’s original offer in October of €23 a share, arguing it failed to properly value the potential upside from a deal that would create one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical wholesalers.If successful, the deal would accelerate transatlantic consolidation of the drugs distribution market after Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, forged alliances with Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen of the US over the past two years.Celesio, based in Stuttgart, has 132 wholesale branches that supply 65,000 pharmacies and hospitals every day in 14 countries, mostly in Europe. It had sales of €22.3bn in 2012.McKesson’s increased bid valued the company at €4bn, or €6.3bn including debt.Shares in Celesio hovered above the offer price at €24 on Thursday afternoon.Elliott, led by US billionaire Paul Singer, said it would tender 4,866 convertible bonds and at least 27.2m shares into the offer.Analysts said Haniel’s €2bn proceeds from the deal, if completed, would give the company a new lease of life to pay down heavy debt and make further acquisitions.The company, best known for its 30 per cent stake in Metro, Germany’s biggest retailer, has said it will target Mittelstand businesses that are looking to expand abroad, with fresh acquisitions possible as early as this year.But Haniel’s determination to focus on smaller investments is likely to leave Metro as its largest single holding.
13;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2013-12-10T17:49:34Z;Elliott aims to block McKesson’s $8.3bn move for Celesio;;A leading hedge fund has warned that it aims to block McKesson’s planned $8.3bn takeover of Celesio, the German-based medicines distribution group which controls Lloyds pharmacy, arguing that it undervalues the business.Elliott Associates said that it and associated entities had acquired more than 25 per cent of Celesio’s shares, ensuring that US-based McKesson’s tender offer requiring 75 per cent of the shares could not go through.The move comes after McKesson negotiated with the Haniel family, which controls just over 50 per cent of Celesio, for the sale of its stake and made a tender offer for the rest of the group at the same price of €23 a share, unveiled in October.It follows restructuring at Celesio at a time of increasingly tough price controls in Europe for drug distribution, led by its home market of Germany, and as consolidation takes place in the sector.Alliance Boots forged a partnership with Walgreens in the US and has more recently linked up with AmerisourceBergen. Phoenix of Germany is the other large European medicines distributor yet to cut a transatlantic deal.A study for the European Commission concluded that average margins for drug distributors were 1.5-3.5 per cent across the EU, with pressure coming from the rise in internet supplies and government initiatives to bring down the cost of medicines.However, Elliott argues that the price undervalues Celesio, and the process should have included a more open tender to potential strategic and private equity buyers, including the option of separately selling its pharmacy and medicines distribution businesses.It said that Celesio’s prospects had been improving ahead of the tender and that it was seeking “fair compensation” for the value of the company.In a statement released on Tuesday, Elliott said: “Simply put, Elliott believes that Celesio’s shareholders and bondholders are not getting a fair deal at the current price . . . [The offer] fails to appropriately compensate [them] for this upside potential.”It stressed that McKesson’s market value had risen by $7.7bn following the planned acquisition, on the back of the US group’s statements that the deal would be rapidly accretive.On a fully diluted basis, Elliott estimates it controls more than 23 per cent of the shares of Celesio, and believes that without its support the tender – which is due to close on January 9 – will fail.Celesio said it had no comment on Tuesday. A spokesman for Haniel said it was sticking to its plan to sell Celesio to McKesson.
14;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2013-10-27T13:59:38Z;McKesson takeover of Celesio to trigger sector consolidation;;McKesson’s $8.3bn planned takeover of Celesio of Germany is set to foreshadow further consolidation in the European medicines distribution sector, analysts believe.The US company, which revealed a deal last week to acquire the controlling Haniel family’s majority stake for €23 a share in Celesio and is tendering to buy the remaining shares, will seek economies of scale and use of its data management expertise to help boost margins.John Hammergren, head of McKesson, said that some savings would come through procurement and global sourcing of products, but also through enhanced efforts to use information on medicine supplies to help retailers, healthcare systems and manufacturers.“We move both drugs and information,” he said, adding that clients were very interested in “where and how drugs are used . . . proper reimbursement and the opportunity to improve adherence.”His comments came despite the fragmentation of Europe’s market for medicines, and tight regulatory controls and competition that have been squeezing profits in recent years.Unlike the US, most countries including France and Germany tightly control the ownership of pharmacy outlets to limit chains, and each government regulates drug pricing closely. Pharmaceuticals companies have also imposed tougher terms with distributors in an effort to control arbitrage between different prices across the EU.Marion Helmes, chief financial officer at Celesio, said last week that “we do see some heavy competition in Germany” during a “fierce rebate war”, while arguing there was growth in many other European countries.Scott Bardo, an analyst with Berenberg, argues that such conditions could drive further consolidation in Europe, as US distributors seek to diversify abroad and European ones come under growing regulatory and commercial pressure.“There have been a lot of challenges in pharmaceutical distribution in European over the last five years, and I fail to see how they are going to abate,” he says. “One can’t but help see it as a good defensive move to be part of a larger global organisation.”Ahead of the Celesio transaction, Alliance Boots forged a partnership with Walgreens in the US and has more recently linked up with AmerisourceBergen. Phoenix of Germany is the other large European medicines distributor yet to cut a transatlantic deal. Other smaller distributors have been bought up in recent years.Girp, the European trade body for wholesalers providing the full range of medicines to pharmacies, has warned that current profit margins are below 1 per cent and falling. “There is a clear danger that with rapidly lowering profitability levels the distribution chain will be pushed beyond its natural breaking point,” it says.A study for the European Commission concluded that average margins for drug distributors were 1.5-3.5 per cent across the EU, with pressure coming from the rise in internet supplies and government initiatives to bring down the cost of medicines.While there has been strong pricing pressure among off-patent, generic drugs, their high and growing volumes across Europe also provide a source of significant business to distributors.Mr Hammergren argued there was also considerable scope to exploit Celesio’s pharmacy chains – such as Lloyds in the UK – to provide more healthcare services to patients such as vaccination and diagnostic blood tests.Leerink rated McKesson “outperform” in a research note, calling the multiple bid of 10.5 times Celesio’s 2012 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation “reasonable”.
15;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2013-10-24T18:49:26Z;McKesson / Celesio: piggyback deal;After two revolutionary mergers, US pill distributors have to build scale;McKesson’s $8bn purchase of Celesio is ho-hum in the annals of recent drug supply chain deals. Sure, it is a nice add-on for McKesson, which, with an enterprise value of $35bn, is the largest US drug wholesaler. It gets a beachhead into Europe and, with cheap debt and synergies, the purchase will increase its earnings by more than a 10th. But the deal just piggybacks on other moves that consolidated the drug supply chain vertically and horizontally. And despite the complexity of those deals, they appear to have worked.Distributing pills is now a better business than developing them. Pharma’s troubles are well known. Innovation has slowed, and former blockbusters have gone off-patent. At the same time, governments are cutting healthcare spending. On the plus side, US healthcare reform and richer emerging nations are creating customers. The imperative for the companies that stand between drugmakers and their customers has become to build scale, since profits have been squeezed out of the broader supply chain.The two revolutionary transactions were the merger of retail chain CVS and pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007, and the 2012 partial tie-up between the US retailer Walgreens, UK retailer Alliance Boots, and McKesson rival AmerisourceBergen.The hang-up to these deals has been so-called “channel conflict”. Drug distributors, benefits managers and retailers compete and co-operate with each other. The benefits manager business of CVS struggled to overcome the alleged favouritism it showed towards its own physical stores. AmerisourceBergen customers wondered if Walgreens would get preferential pricing. But a look at stock price performance of the companies involved shows the market believes in these deals. AmerisourceBergen is up nearly half this year. And CVS is up 70 per cent in the last two.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
16;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2013-10-23T15:27:30Z;McKesson closes in on Celesio deal;;McKesson plans to announce as soon as Thursday an agreement to buy a majority stake in German drug wholesaler Celesio, valuing its debt and equity at more than $8bn and giving the US drug distributor a global platform.The deal will pit the San Francisco-headquartered group against Alliance Boots and Walgreens, which combined last year and have since been expanding their global health and pharmaceutical empire.McKesson is likely to announce an agreement with Franz Haniel & Cie, the German family holding company, to buy its stake of about 50 per cent in Celesio for about €23 a share, said people with knowledge of the situation. “The deal will strengthen McKesson’s relative position against Walgreens,” said one of the people.The deal would value the company’s equity at about €3.91bn ($5.3bn). The announcement is set to coincide with McKesson’s second-quarter results presentation.The takeover would give McKesson the ability to provide an alternative global wholesale distribution platform for generic drug suppliers. Celesio owns the pharmacy chain Lloyds, which operates across the UK and Europe, giving McKesson access to a retail network and know-how.McKesson will offer to buy all the outstanding shares of Celesio at about €23 a share, with Franz Haniel tendering its stake into the offer. However it is conditional on the US group being able to buy at least about 75 per cent of the shares, people familiar with the situation said.Two people familiar with the situation said that KKR, the private equity company that controls Alliance Boots, had also expressed an interest in the stake. KKR was not available for comment.Analysts at Commerzbank suggested the tie-up could generate about €600m in savings, based on the synergies from the combination of Alliance Boots and Walgreens.McKesson was not available for comment. Celesio and Franz Haniel declined to comment. Celesio is headquartered in Stuttgart in Germany and has 38,000 employees, and operators in 14 countries.This deal raises questions about whether CVS and Cardinal Health, two rival US distributors, will seek to expand internationally through acquisitions, said one industry specialist. It could also revive takeover speculation around Phoenix, a large German drug wholesaler, the specialist said.In March, Alliance Boots and Walgreens expanded their alliance in a deal to buy more drugs from – and potentially take a stake in – AmerisourceBergen, a US drug wholesaler. The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the option to build a stake of up to 23 per cent in AmerisourceBergen, worth $2.5bn, an example of vertical integration with a retail pharmacy becoming part-owner of a drug wholesaler.Walgreens will expand its existing drug-buying arrangement with AmerisourceBergen to a 10-year distribution deal worth $28bn, while ending its current relationship with Cardinal Health.Celesio shares rose 5.6 per cent to €21.70 on Wednesday.
17;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2013-10-08T12:32:45Z;Celesio: drug taker;Now is not a good time to buy the German drug distributor;No one is making money in the German drug distribution market. Marion Helmes, chief of German drug distributor and retailer Celesio, says this is “obvious”. There are still some executives who can get to the point.The problem is competitive discounting, which forced Celesio to warn on profits in August. The company says healthcare spending in its core European market is growing at 0.7 per cent a year, against 5 per cent globally. Now does not seem an obviously good time to buy Celesio.Yet stranger things have happened. Reports on Tuesday that McKesson Corp of the US was in talks with Celesio’s majority shareholder sent shares of the German company up 20 per cent, valuing the drug distributor’s equity at €3.5bn. McKesson’s $30bn bulk can absorb that. But any buyer must balance the benefits of greater bargaining power in negotiations with pharma companies against exposure to a sluggish European economy and declining margins. Nearly 70 per cent of Celesio’s fiscal 2012 revenue of €22bn was generated in France, the UK and Germany (in that order).The template is Walgreen’s purchase of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots last year for $6.7bn. That put an enterprise value multiple on AB of a tasty 11 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Even after the speculative jump to €20 a share, Celesio is trading at an ev/ebitda ratio of just 8.3. A price in the region of €25 a share for Celesio would seem fair – or at least possible. But there is a complication.Any buyer of Celesio must first approach Franz Haniel & Cie, the holding company that owns 50.01 per cent of the group (as McKesson has reportedly done). The price question is not just one of how badly a buyer such as McKesson wants to own Celesio. It is of how badly a family-controlled shareholder wants to sell.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
18;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2012-04-12T20:56:58Z;Wall St extends rally on earnings hopes;;Wall Street brushed aside a second consecutive downbeat jobs report as shares in LinkedIn jumped more than 8 per cent and rumours of a stronger than expected growth figure from China lifted markets on Thursday.The online professional networking site was buoyed by an analyst note that raised the price target for shares in the LinkedIn to $115, saying that a hiring spree has not hurt the company’s margins.“LinkedIn has been rapidly expanding its field sales teams to capture share of large and growing opportunities in the worldwide talent acquisition and online advertising markets,” said Scott Devitt, analyst at Morgan Stanley.“While sales hires typically take [about] two quarters to generate enough revenue to cover their own compensation costs – leading to “ramping” employees comprising nearly 50 per cent of total sales staff in some periods – LinkedIn managed to maintain revenue per average sales head at 75 to 80 per cent of its peak levels,” he added.The company’s shares gained 8.4 per cent to $105.90, moving back above the $100 mark for the first time since retreating from highs achieved last Wednesday. Shares in LinkedIn are now up more than 68 per cent on the year.The S&P 500 materials, energy and industrials indices were all up more than 2 per cent on the day as rumours swirled through the market that Friday’s gross domestic product report from China would be stronger than expected.Among the top gainers on those sub-indices were coalminers Alpha Natural Resources, up nearly 10 per cent at $16.08, and copper and gold-miner Freeport-McMoRan, 5.9 per cent higher at $37.89.Overall, the S&P 500 made strong gains for a second straight session, adding 1.4 per cent to 1,387.57, but the benchmark index remains almost 2.5 per cent lower than its cyclical high achieved last Monday.Of the recent losses, Justin Waters at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors have been extremely skittish throughout this entire bull market due to the bad taste left in their mouths from the crash during the financial crisis.”But equities shook off a fresh jobs report that showed first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week to 380,000, the highest level in two-and-a-half months. The figure, which went up by 13,000 in the week to April 7, came in worse than analysts’ estimates of 359,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 12,986.58, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3 per cent to 3,055.55.Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Vix index of implied equity volatility, fell back below 20 after steadily rising over the S&P’s recent slide. The Vix was more than 14 per cent lower to 17.24.McKesson, the largest drug distributor in the US by revenue, said it had beaten its competitors to win an important government contract to act as the prime pharmaceutical supplier for the Department of Veterans Affairs.The initial two-year contract will allow the company to continue to supply more than 700 locations, including 270 medical centres, with drugs for veterans of the US military. The contract can be extended for up to an additional six years, making it worth as much as $31.6bn according to estimates.Shares in McKesson rose 3.9 per cent to $91.34 on news of the win.Elsewhere, Bed, Bath & Beyond edged up 0.1 per cent to $70.14 as the home goods retailer had its equity downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who said there was limited upside to shares at their present level.Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: “We calculate that Bed, Bath & Beyond’s market share declined in [its fourth quarter] for the first time this decade, and we expect a deceleration of top-and-bottom line growth in [its current financial year] and beyond.”Delta Air Lines, whose 2011 fuel costs were $11.8bn last year, was among the morning’s top risers, gaining 3.5 per cent to $10.26. The Atlanta-based US carrier could save up to 10 per cent a year on its fuel needs if it goes ahead with the purchase of an oil refinery in Pennsylvania, according to reports citing a person familiar with the discussions between Delta and ConocoPhillips.A deal, if completed, would be a unique effort by an airline to save on hefty fuel costs, which for Delta accounted for more than one-third of its annual spending.Better than expected sales in the first quarter by the personal computer industry helped shares in Hewlett-Packard gain 7.2 per cent to $25.10. The world’s largest maker of personal computers was among the day’s best performing equities after a report from Gartner, the researching firm, that said total global shipments rose 1.9 per cent to 89 million units in the first quarter.Groupon, the offers and daily deals website, rose 3.7 per cent to $13.56, moving away from an all-time low struck earlier in the week. Shares in the company are down more than 32 per cent from its debut price of $20 last November.Aluminium manufacturer Alcoa continued to add to its gains after reporting better than expected first-quarter results.

If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.

This is the lowest reading since July 2009 and reflected a loss of confidence even though orders, sales and employment all improved. Economists had forecast an increase to 8.“The New York Fed came in today pretty neutral; the headline figure wasn’t great but when you look within the six-month outlook on general business conditions, employment, capital expenditure, we still look to be in expansion mode and that’s good,” said Linda Duessel, equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Investors shrugged off another release that showed US industrial output in August grew at a slower pace than in July. Manufacturing activity increased 0.2 per cent last month after rising 0.6 per cent in the previous month.A separate report showed import prices rose faster than expected in August on the back of higher petrol and food prices and export prices rebounded from a drop in July.The S&P 500 industrials index edged higher by 0.1 per cent.But healthcare stocks benefited from a ratings change after Lazard Capital Markets said that shares in drug distributor McKesson may have hit bottom.

22;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Healthcare software opens to a new generation;;After a lost decade, the UK healthcare software market is opening up to a new generation of companies.Government spending and media attention for much of the past 10 years has centred on the flagship £12.7bn ($18.8bn) National Programme for IT, an all-encompassing plan to modernise and connect large parts of the IT system of the NHS in England and Wales.But the scale and complexity of the project led to long delays and contractors had their fingers burnt. Isoft, once valued at £1bn, nearly collapsed while BT’s Global Services division attributed a significant part of its £1.3bn writedown in 2008-09 to contract delays within the project.This year has seen officials responsible for its implementation admitting that the National Programme will not deliver all that it intended, most notably in the critical area of patient care records.Its breakdown, and government plans for the NHS to make at least £20bn in efficiency cuts, has allowed emerging companies such as Emis, System C Healthcare, Iris Software and INPS to make rapid inroads into the market.“The opportunity is there. It could be a platform for growth of the UK software market for new companies and be a regeneration for the UK software industry,” said Matthew Swindells, managing director for health at Tribal Group, the outsourcing company.He should know. Mr Swindells is a former chief information officer of the NHS and is chairman of the British Computer Society’s Health division. But he cautions it will be a selective market. “The real issue is that the only game in town is quality and productivity. Interesting new software isn’t going to get a look in until it drives productivity,” he said.Healthcare industry executives are betting that budgetary constraints will force the NHS to turn to technology to provide more cost savings, mainly in the form of efficiencies in administration. Kable, the public sector consultancy, has forecast that software investment will rise from £86.4m in 2007-08 to £364.6m in 2013-14, a compound annual growth rate of 27.1 per cent, the highest area for technology spending in the UK public sector.To little fanfare, the past year has seen companies large and small positioning themselves to take on more work for the NHS.Capita, one of the largest outsourcing specialists, recently bought Premier Medical Group for £60m, while Advanced Computer Software, the acquisitive consolidation group, bought COA Solutions from Alchemy Partners for £100m. And last year United Health, the US health insurance group valued at $8bn (£5.4bn), bought Scriptswitch, the drug comparison software provider, for £50m.Emis, which provides software for GP surgeries, has been among the few technology companies to brave a stock market flotation this year.All such providers have promised that their product will streamline administration in the NHS, which in effect means fewer jobs.“The reality is that you could deliver just as good frontline services to the community at large, you could take billions of pounds out of the health budget just by being administratively more efficient,” says Paul Pindar, chief executive of Capita.Much of the past decade has seen large companies such as CSC and Cerner dominate but as the market breaks down, investors and analysts expect the smaller home-grown operators to come to the fore.But Ian Spence, an analyst at IS Research, pointed out that healthcare software stocks have outperformed other government-related public sector software companies in the past year. “It seems to us investors are focusing on the potential opportunities resulting from the likely restructuring of Connecting for Health and ignoring the potential pitfalls,” he said.Chief among those will be the pace of change. For all the industry’s optimism, it is dealing with the most politically sensitive part of the public sector.Furthermore, the record of IT projects, such as the National Programme, for making savings in the health service is relatively poor. “The opportunity is enormous – but the potential for nothing to happen is also quite high,” Mr Swindells said.Such pessimism is challenged by others in the industry. Vin Murria, chief executive of ACS argues that smaller systems have worked in the NHS. ACS provides software for virtually all of the NHS’s out of hours service.There is agreement that the software industry is likely to see consolidation and new partnerships.“Consolidation is inevitable as companies starved of new business for nearly a decade struggle to cope with volume demands over a short timescale,” said a private company executive who declined to be named.Liz Jones, head of healthcare at Isis Equity Partners, the private equity firm that sold Scriptswitch, said in all sectors, companies will want to act local but have a national presence. “Businesses with £500,000-£1m profit become attractive targets,” she said.

The bank said it had not been contacted by any investigators.Mr Armiger, whose portfolio is underweight on financials, said: “The big investment banks are doing okay because of the low borrowing rates but they are not doing much lending. We’re not excited about the sector.”Bank of America fell 0.5 per cent to $17.07, AIG lost 3.5 per cent to $41.40, but Goldman Sachs was 3.7 per cent higher at $147.20.Department store chain Macy’s rallied 3.4 per cent to $24.70 on strong first-quarter results, boosted by rising revenues.Net income was 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of 21 cents per share a year earlier and average analyst expectations of a 4 cent per share profit.The company maintained the full-year earnings forecast it issued last month for annual earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.Disney pulled back 1.8 per cent to $35.13, in spite of its first-quarter results beating analyst expectations.Its television business recorded lower-than-expected results but the movie division was
stronger-than-expected, boosted by the success of its Alice in Wonderland 3D blockbuster. The group’s second-quarter net income was $953m, or 48 cents per share, compared with $613m, or 33 cents a share, in the previous year. It topped average analyst expectations of 45 cents per share.Intel, the microchip maker, rose 3.6 per cent to $23.09 after a bullish investor day on Tuesday.The company said it expected to double its earnings in the next few years as it pushes into new fast-growing segments, namely smartphones and TVs. Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, also said he was “highly confident” that it would achieve its financial goals for the current quarter.Electronic Arts retreated 5.8 per cent to $17.71, making it one of the day’s biggest fallers, after the video game company lowered its first-quarter and full-year outlook for 2011 in a restatement, disappointing some investors who had expected a rise.Pharma group Merck was 0.4 per cent higher at $33.64 after its annual research and development briefing day. “Merck remains our top pick in US major pharma [sector], given relative valuation, strong pipeline, and near-term synergy potential,” said Anthony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “We would be buyers at these levels.”Industrials stocks performed well across the sector. Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, was up 3.2 per cent to $68.15 and Deere & Co, the maker of agricultural equipment rallied 2.8 per cent to $61.14.Consumer staples stocks were higher. Tyson Foods, a meat production company, rose 0.6 per cent to $18.13. Conagra, which supplies vegetables to restaurants added 1.6 per cent to $24.74 and Mead Johnson, which makes children’s food, rose 2.3 per cent to $52.42.The rise in gold prices helped lift metals producers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 3.9 per cent to $73 and Newmont Mining rose 0.9 per cent to $58.71.Pharmaceutical distributor McKesson gained 4.5 per cent to $69.06 as the stock was raised to “buy” by Goldman Sachs."
24;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2009-05-05T15:24:40Z;Wall Street set for post-rally slide;;"US stocks were slipped on Tuesday morning following a stellar session which took the benchmark S&P 500 over 900 and into positive territory for the year.Rumours surrounding the results of the government stress tests on banks’ balance sheets continued to dominate Wall Street, with reports suggesting 10 of the banks may need to boost capital positions to weather a deeper recession.There was a mixed reaction to the news, with several banks giving up some of the gains made during Monday’s rally. Wells Fargo, which jumped more than 23 per cent during the previous session, dropped 3.7 per cent to $23.35. JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon said: “The banking system can handle an awful lot of loss and be okay,” fell 1.8 per cent to $35.16.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global warned: “It looks like companies need to raise capital and the number of banks needing capital seems to be going up and not down.”But Bank of America and Citigroup, which are believed to be working on plans to raise $10bn of extra capital to meet the stress test requirements, and which many analysts have said already have the prospect of further equity raising priced into their stock, both found gains. Bank of America rose 2.5 per cent to $10.64 while Citigroup gained 4.8 per cent to $3.35.There was further support for financial stocks from Principal Financial Group, the life insurer, which jumped 13.8 per cent to $19.26 despite missing analysts’ expectations with its first quarter earnings after the company’s investments suffered in the market slump.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 905.8 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.7 per cent to 1,752.08 points. The Dow Jones was stronger, however, rising 0.2 per cent to 8,442.59 points.Some of the losses were erased as Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, started speaking to Congress about the state of the economy. Mr Bernanke was due to say he sees the housing market stabilising, but that job losses will continue to rise.Equities were also helped by figures showing that non-manufacturing activity slowed its contraction during April.McKesson, the pharmaceutical company, beat analysts; estimates with its earnings, but fell back before the bell after it lowered its earnings forecast the full year, which it said assumed the economy and financial markets would stay flat for most of the fiscal year until March 2010. Its shares lost 1.6 per cent to $39.75.DR Horton also disappointed the market after the homebuilder reported a loss of 34 cents per share, wider than analysts had predicted. Revenue from homebuilding fell sharply, cancelling out a steep fall in writedowns also. The company shares gave up 7.3 per cent to $12.51.But consumer companies received a boost after Kraft Foods, which makes household brands such as Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee, reported better profits than expected as dairy costs fell. The company did not raise its full year outlook, but the shares rose 5.8 per cent to $25.66.There was also good news on consumer activity from MGM Mirage, the casino operator which has been restructuring its debts recently in the face of a sharp fall in revenues. The company posted a surprise first quarter profit after selling one of its casinos, and also said occupancy rates at its hotels had begun to recover. Its shares jumped 17 per cent to $11.04.But Avon Products took some of the shine off the sector after the cosmetics retailer earned less than analysts had forecast, with sales and revenues falling. The company was also hurt by a strong dollar, and lost 3.5 per cent to $24.33.Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural processor, also missed analysts forecasts after suffering a 98 per cent drop in profits. The company suffered as demand for its oilseeds and agricultural services fell amid the deepening recession, as well as having to pay two one-off charges on equity investments. The company’s shares fell 6.2 per cent to $24.54.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.9 per cent higher at 850.31 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, with the Hang Seng edging 0.3 per cent ahead to 16,430.08 points.Bond yields slipped, with the yield on the two-year and the 10-year Treasury notes falling 1 basis point to 0.947 per cent and 3.163 per cent respectively.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York, falling 0.3 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading 92 cents higher at $910.19 per troy ounce.Oil prices were lower early in New York. US crude prices fell 3 cents to $54.44 a barrel."
25;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2009-03-11T20:38:34Z;Financials continue gains on Wall Street;;US stocks held on to modest gains on Wednesday in a choppy session as equity markets closed up for their second consecutive session for the first time in a month.Banks had surged during early trade on the back of comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that he would “do what is necessary” to stem the recession. He also said the government would use the promise of federal loans to entice investors to buy distressed assets from banks, while offering sellers capital injections.Financial shares received another boost late in the day when Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, told CNBC that his bank had been profitable for the first two months of the year. JPMorgan gained 4.6 per cent to $20.40, while Citigroup closed 6.2 per cent up to $1.54 and Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $4.93.Confidence in banking stocks was also given a lift by figures showing that mortgage applications had risen 11.3 per cent for the week ending March 6.But the Mortgage Bankers Association was careful to say that this was largely fuelled by existing homeowners refinancing rather than new buyers entering the market.Sentiment was further helped when Goldman Sachs said it believed a number of financial institutions would be able to pay back money received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) over the next year. They included Morgan Stanley and US Bancorp, which rose 8 per cent to $22.51 and 9 per cent to $12.42 respectively.But American Express fell after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “neutral” to “conviction sell”. Fears over bad debts in the credit card industry have increased recently, and the company’s stock fell 2 per cent to $11.93.The gains made by financial companies were largely cancelled out by falls in the energy sector as the oil price plunged by around three dollars in late trade. Chevron’s shares lost 0.9 per cent to $61.22, while Exxon Mobilfell 2.4 per cent to $65.77.There were also significant falls for healthcare companies. McKesson the largest US drug distributor, dropped 17.1 per cent to $34.77 after Deutsche Bank said its earning might suffer as a result of drug store bankruptcies.Fellow drug distributors Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen also lost out. They fell 9.8 per cent to $28.59 and 9.7 per cent to $28.19 respectively. The sector as a whole, which has taken a a battering since President Obama said subsidies to healthcare companies would be cut to pay for his administration’s reforms, fell 2 per cent.Overall the benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent to 721.36 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.1 per cent to 6,930.40.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned: “With restrictions on short-selling about to be reinstated, this is the market repositioning itself. But those things do not solve the problem. No major policy change has come out of Washington, which is a headwind to a lasting rally.”The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other two measures, however, boosted by strong performance from technology stocks. It rose 1 per cent to 1,371.64.Hewlett Packard rose 5.8 per cent to $28.61 after UBS upgraded the company to “buy”. UBS said market sentiment on the company was overly bearish, and this helped push shares in Appleup 4.6 per cent to $92.68 and in IBM up 1.6 per cent to $88.62.But National Semiconductor, the chip manufacturer, fared badly after reporting earnings of 9 cents a share, which was below analysts’ forecasts. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $11.38.Mining companies also did well on the back of a rise in the price of precious metals. Newmont , the gold miner, picked up 4.7 per cent to $36.66. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 4.1 per cent to $35.56.“I think gold is in a great bull market at the moment,” said Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management. “As currencies continue to lose ground, we will see many further upward movements in gold.”But the fragility of consumer confidence and spending was highlighted by worse results than expected from Staples the office supplies store, as weak revenues took their toll. The company’s shares fell 1.7 per cent to $15.47.
26;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2006-11-07T18:27:40Z;FTSE back at five-year highs;;Software company Misys closed at its highest level since takeover talks with a management buy-out team collapsed a month ago.Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to 215¼p excited by news that Per-Se Technologies, a US medical software company and peer, had recommended a $1.2bn (£630m) cash offer from McKesson Corporation.Investors were quick to pick up on the fact that Per-Se’s biggest shareholder, with a 15.5 per cent stake, was ValueAct Capital.The US activist investor, which has a reputation for buying stakes in undervalued companies and agitating for change, is the former employer of Mike Lawrie, the new chief executive of Misys. ValueAct has also been building a stake in Misys since news of Mr Lawrie’s appointment was announced on October 16.After the market closed on Monday, ValueAct revealed that its stake in Misys had increased to 5.1 per cent.In the wider market, a firm opening on Wall Street helped the FTSE 100 close up 19.5 points, or 0.3 per cent, at a fresh five-year high of 6,244.0. Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 gained 64.5 points, or 0.6 per cent, to a record high of 10,559.9.Marks and Spencer led the FTSE 100 higher. Its shares gained 6.3 per cent to a record high of 698p when analysts increased profit forecasts after stronger-than-anticipated interim results.On the downside, Yell Group, the Yellow Pages company, lost 6.7 per cent to 583p after half-year results fell short of expectations. Disappointing results were also behind the weakness in brewer Scottish & Newcastle, off 2.9 per cent to 552p, and Associated British Foods, down 0.8 per cent to 844p.BT Group improved 1.2 per cent to 288½p ahead of tomorrow’s half-year figures. In a research note to clients yesterday, Investec Securities said the time was approaching for BT to “gear” up its balance sheet and return cash to shareholders.Elsewhere, vague stake-building rumours helped credit checking company Experian Grouprise 2.4 per cent to 591p, while Corus firmed 0.1 per cent to 465¾p on talk that Russia’s Novolipetsk could trump Tata Steel’s 455p-a-share offer for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.In the mining sector, Xstrata rose 1.3 per cent to £24.20 as zinc prices hit a record high. John Meyer, analyst at Numis Securities, said Xstrata was one of the best ways to play a rising zinc price.Elsewhere, British Land rose 1.4 per cent to a record high of £15.27 helped by vague rumours of a bid from a wealthy Russian investor and an “overweight” recommendation from HSBC.Standard Chartered, the emerging markets bank, drifted 0.5 per cent to £14.87 amid rumours that it is to buy ABN Amro’s 40 per cent stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank. Analysts said Standard would probably need to issue £1bn of equity to fund the deal.In the same sector, HBOS eased 0.4 per cent to £10.90 after Cazenove downgraded the bank to “in line” from “outperform”. The broker believed HBOS’s growth prospects were more closely aligned with its UK peers than at any time in the past.Away from the blue chips, fund manager Henderson Group fell 3.2 per cent to 111¼p after UBS placed 48m shares – 5.3 per cent of the company – on behalf of hedge fund Altima Group.JD Wetherspoon faded 0.5 per cent to 620¼p on news that Tim Martin, chairman, had taken advantage of recent share price strength to sell 600,000 shares at 624p each.Galiform, the former MFI Furniture Group, advanced another 3.8 per cent to 110p as takeover rumours continued to swirl.Elsewhere, Meggitt, the aerospace supplier, fell 1.7 per cent to 323½p after UBS downgraded it, citing valuation.Great Portland Estates improved 2.2 per cent to 615p as investors caught up with Monday’s news that the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation had built a 3.6 per cent stake in the property company.Speculation of a private equity bid approach sent Restaurant Group3.6 per cent higher to 263¼p.In the same sector, pub operator Mitchells & Butlers improved 0.1 per cent to 612p. After the expiry of a six-month moratorium, financier Robert Tchenguiz will be free to bid for M&B from today. But traders believe he now has his sights on Wolverhampton & Dudley, up 1.6 per cent to £15.10.Hardy Underwriting eased 1.2 per cent to 243p in spite of talk that it could be the next Lloyds insurance vehicle to receive a takeover approach.
27;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2006-11-06T21:38:57Z;US stocks rally on bargain-hunting;;Wall Street stocks settled near their peaks in New York on Monday after bargain-hunting sparked by merger and buyout deals.The improved tone came after the robust October jobs report last week that partly eased concerns about the extent of a US economic slowdown and from hopes of a benign outcome to the US mid-term elections.The prospect of a shift in power after the US mid-term elections on Tuesday, that results in gridlock is not unnerving investors.“With power in the House potentially turning over to the Democrats, thereby creating the potential for legislative gridlock situation,” Deutsche Bank noted “our analysis finds the standard wisdom that `gridlock is good for the market’ appears true. In gridlock years, the Dow returned an average of 19.5 per cent versus an average return of 11.2 per cent in non-gridlock years.”Leading deal activity was a $3.7bn bid for Four Seasons Hotels. The $82-a-share cash offer reflected a 28 per cent premium over its closing price from last week. Shares in Four Seasons were up $18.63, or 29 per cent, at $82.50.The bid consortium includes Microsoft founder Bill Gates, billionaire Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz, and Four Seasons chairman and chief executive Isadore Sharp.Abbott Laboratories also announced plans to acquire drugmaker Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7bn in cash, or $78 a share. That is about 56 per cent above where Kos closed on Friday.Shares in Abbott were down 0.4 per cent, at $47.47, while shares in Kos surged $26.97, or 53.8 per cent, to $77.06.OSI Restaurants received a $3.2bn offer from a private equity group. Its shares were up $7.32, or 22.6 per cent, at $39.75.Swift Transportation rose $5.79, or 24 per cent, to $29.84 after it received a buyout bid from its largest shareholder, former chief executive Jerry Moyes. The bid was made at $29 a share.McKesson said it would buy Per-Se Technologies in a $1.8bn deal. Per-Se shares were up 12.7 per cent at $27.55 while McKesson’s shares were 2.4 per cent firmer at $49.69.The S&P 500 closed up 15.48 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,379.78. Technology stocks such as Cisco, up 3.8 per cent at $24.68, helped boost the Nasdaq Composite 35.16 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 2,365.95.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled up 119.51 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,105.55, reversing last week’s close below 12,000. The Transports index was up 1.78 per cent.Of the Dow’s 30 members, 28 were higher, led by United Technologies, up 1.8 per cent at $65.15, and IBM, up 1.3 per cent at $92.60. The laggard was Caterpillar, off 0.9 per cent at $59.86. After a UBS downgrade, Home Depot reversed much of its earlier weakness, but Lowes, was off 0.8 per cent at $28.82.Shares in biopharmaceutical group Adolor plunged 44.8 per cent to $7.69 after it told investors that the Food and Drug Administration required further testing of a product called Entereg, a bowel surgery drug.Analysts were expecting FDA approval of Entereg this week.El Paso was down 1.4 per cent at $13.72 after the company returned to profitability for the third quarter.XM Satellite Radio rose 15.6 per cent, to $13.17 after reporting a narrower loss for the third quarter.Standard and Poor’s Index Services said on Monday, earnings released by 85 per cent of the S&P 500 companies were running at “a 19.9 per cent gain over that of the third quarter 2005” and “operating earnings are estimated at $22.59 per share, surpassing the old record set last quarter at $21.95.” Companies in the Materials sector lead the earnings charge, up 50.12 per cent, with those in the Consumer Discretionary group second at 43.99 per cent.
28;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2006-11-01T21:29:01Z;Wall St lower as economic data weighs;;"Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as the good mood surrounding stellar earnings from MasterCard and healthy deal activity was punctured by economic data.That in turn aggravated concerns among investors that the economy could face a harder landing in 2007.After a bright opening, shares pulled back when the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index suggested activity was nearly at the threshold separating expansion and contraction. Housing and construction activity also slowed.In earnings news, MasterCard reported an 82 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings to $1.42 per share; well above the consensus estimate of $1.07 per share. Shares in the company closed $10.97, or 14.8 per cent, higher at $85.07.Merger and acquisition activity was also in the spotlight. R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it intended to buy Banta in a deal worth about $1.3bn. Shares in Banta increased by $7.87, or 17.8 per cent, to reach $52.15. Donnelley’s shares were 39 cents, or 1.2 per cent, firmer at $34.25.Pharmacy chain CVS and pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx, which has a market value of about $21bn, said they would merge, with CVS exchanging 1.67 shares for each share of Caremark.

Caremark shares were down $1.06, or 2.2 per cent, to $48.17, once the terms were announced, down from a high of $53.65.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research Services reiterated its strong buy recommendation for CVS. “We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS’s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business,” said analyst Joe Agnese.The news buffeted the healthcare sector. Shares in McKesson swung sharply after its fiscal second-quarter earnings topped estimates and were off $1.10 or 2.2 per cent, at $48.99. Some analysts said a CVS-Caremark merger could reduce earnings at companies like McKesson.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was 10.1 points, or 0.7 per cent, lower at 1,367.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 32.4 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 2,334.35.

29;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Tom Horton returns as CFO to American Airlines;;Tom Horton is leaving AT&T to become chief financial officer at American Airlines, a position he vacated four years ago to join the telecommunications group.The US airline had initially said it was focused on an internal hire to fill the slot left by James Beer, who resigned in February to join Symantec, the software security group.He becomes American’s fourth CFO in as many years, and the departure of his predecessors to other sectors – coupled to a parade of senior departures at other airlines – had fuelled the concern in recent months about executive retention within the industry, a debate intensified by union opposition to management pay agreements.Delta Air Lines has warned that management attrition had risen eight-fold since the group filed for bankruptcy protection last September, and fellow Chapter 11 carrier Northwest has also lost staff.Mr Horton spent 17 years at American before joining AT&T, where he rose to become vice-chairman ahead of the group’s $67bn bid for rival BellSouth earlier this month. The airline described the hire as “a bold move” to position the company “with a strong leader from outside the airline industry.The airline also announced the planned retirement of Pete Dolara, who spearheaded its expansion to become the largest airline flying into central America. Craig Kreeger, the head of its European and Asian business, has been promoted to become senior vice-president international.UK-born Mr Beer joined AMR, American’s parent, in 1991 from Andersen Consulting and assumed the CFO role in December 2003 when Jeff Campbell left to join McKesson, the consulting firm. He in turn took over from Mr Horton in 2002.Mr Beer’s base salary at AMR was about half that of Gregory Myers, who retired as Symantec’s CFO at the end of last year.American has pledged to review its executive compensation strategy amid widespread employee discontent over plans that could result in 1,000 top managers receiving more than $70m in cash bonuses this year.
30;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2005-05-18T21:04:07Z;Foreign investors miss out on US awards;;Europe-based shareholders in US companies last year failed to collect $2.4bn awarded to them as a result of securities class action lawsuits, according to research by a UK-based consultancy.Similar amounts will be lost this year unless non-US investors take steps to claim their entitlement, says London-based Magenta One.Investors are struggling to keep track of what they are entitled to and regularly miss out on strict claims deadlines set by the courts.The money available to foreign investors has risen substantially in recent years as a result of increased cross-border investment in US companies, higher levels of corporate fraud and increased litigation.Figures compiled by Magenta One show in 2003-04, Europe-based investors failed to collect $2.4bn, or 95 per cent of the amount awarded to them. The biggest settlements last year included Lucent Technologies ($517m), Raytheon ($460m) and Global Crossing ($244m). This year, at least $6bn is expected to be awarded to investors as a result of fresh settlements relating to US companies such as WorldCom, McKesson and Adelphia.The majority of non-US investors affected are based in the UK. One leading institutional investor, Hermes Fund Management, acknowledged many investors outside the US find it difficult to know how and where to claim. Paul Lee, Hermes associate director, said: “Clearly there is money being left on the table and investors need services to address this issue.”Magenta One has launched a service for non-US investors, aimed at tracking and collecting any entitlements. Many US investors have for a decade outsourced the recovery of class action awards to firms such as Claims Compensation Bureau and Institutional Shareholder Services.Mr Lee said: “The headline figure might be large but the individual amounts involved can be quite small and investors have to judge whether it is worth the administration cost to take steps and collect the money.”Securities class action lawsuits are growing as a global phenomenon. China and Japan recently experienced their first class action lawsuits and allowed foreign investors to join in.David Monks, managing director of Magenta One, says many non-US investors fail to claim because they believe they have to appear in court or might be jointly liable for the legal costs in bringing the case. He said: “The lawsuits in the US are initiated by law firms who shoulder all the costs. Investors simply have to claim whatever amount they are entitled to. Pension fund clients are missing out on billions in compensation.”
31;MCK;Mckesson Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
