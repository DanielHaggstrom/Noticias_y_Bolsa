0;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-03-25T22:32:50Z;Coronavirus: American Airlines draws down $1bn loan – as it happened;;"Nearly 80% of Nike stores in China back in businessAlistair Gray in New YorkAbout four out of five Nike stores are open in greater China, the US sportswear company said today, offering at least some hope that economies brought to a standstill by the pandemic might be able to get back on their feet within months.The reopenings, disclosed in Nike’s quarterly results report, mark a swift recovery from the height of China’s coronavirus crisis in February. At its peak, Nike shut three-quarters of its outlets in the region.Nike has since closed owned stores in several other countries, including in the US, Canada and western Europe, as authorities around the world impose restrictions on discretionary shopping to control the outbreak.Shares rose a further 6.5 per cent in after-hours trading, following a 15 per cent jump in the New York market rally today. They are still down 25 per cent for the year.Australian companies announce swathe of layoffsJamie Smyth reports from SydneyAustralian companies announced a swathe of layoffs on Wednesday with Virgin Australia and clothing retailer Mosaic brands announcing the standing down of almost 15,000 workers.The layoffs, which both companies said were temporary measures to cope with the coronavirus crisis, follow a further clamp down on businesses and the movement of people set to take effect from midnight.Under the new measures beauty parlours, casinos, gyms and a range of other venues will close and barbecues or other social gatherings with more than 10 people have been banned.Canberra is also banning Australians from travelling abroad, as the number of coronavirus cases tops 2,000, more than double the number just three days earlier. However, schools in most states remain open – a controversial decision that has prompted criticism from some health experts, who have recommended implementing some of the tougher measures seen in Europe.Brendan Murphy, Australia’s chief medical officer, said it was not credible to put in place measures for a few weeks and suddenly stop them.“So we are very keen to put as restrictive measures in place without completely destroying life as we know it.”Virgin said it would begin grounding 125 aircraft from and standing down 80 per cent of its 10,000 workers until at least May in response to the extraordinary situation. Mosaic Brands, which owns several retailers such as Noni B, said it would close all its stores and stand down staff due to a substantial drop in foot traffic due to social distancing rules.The swathe of job losses across the economy has put intense pressure on social welfare services, with long lines of people queueing up outside unemployment offices and its main website crashing because of the deluge of claims.Westpac economists forecast the jobless rate in Australia will rise from 5 per cent to 11.1 per cent by the end of June, with more than 800,000 jobs losses in the second quarter.Star Casino also stood down 90 per cent of its 9,000 workers on Wednesday.News you might have missedFrance becomes fifth country to record more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths France has become the fifth country to record more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus as it enters its second week of lockdown.

London’s FTSE gained 9 per cent.S&P 500 futures were down 0.8 per cent on Wednesday.Imported coronavirus cases in China near 500Health authorities in China reported 47 new coronavirus cases to the end of Tuesday, all of which were imported from overseas. Those new infections take the number of imported cases to 474.Wuhan, where the outbreak started, recorded no new cases on Tuesday. The Hubei health commission said restrictions on the movement of people in the province will be relaxed this week and will be extended to Wuhan, the provincial capital, on April 8.The total number of coronavirus cases reported in the mainland rose to 81,218.There were four new deaths, taking the overall number of fatalities to 3,281.Bolsonaro downplays virus as a ‘sniffle’Andres Schipani reports from São PauloBrazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed coronavirus as a “sniffle” in a provocative televised address on Tuesday evening even as the number of cases soared.Brazil has the highest number of confirmed cases in Latin America, but the populist president’s response to the outbreak has been muted compared to that of many other regional leaders. By Tuesday, the number of recorded Covid-19 cases in Brazil had jumped to 2,201 -- an almost tenfold increase in a week. The country has recorded 46 fatalities, the largest number in the region.“The virus arrived, it is being faced by us and it will soon pass, our life must go on,” Mr Bolsonaro said, adding, “We should, yes, return to normality.”He described the reaction to the virus as “hysteria”, slamming state governors and city mayors for taking the lead in shutting down venues, non-essential shops, and asking citizens to stay at home. “They should abandon banning public transport, shutting down businesses, and mass confinement,” the right-wing president said.The 65-year-old former army captain went on to say that he was sure he would be unaffected if he was infected with the virus.“What is happening in the world has shown that the risk group is that of people over 60 years of age. So, why close schools? Rare are the fatal cases of healthy people under 40 years of age. Ninety percent of us will have no symptomatic manifestation if we get contaminated ... In my particular case, due to my track record as an athlete, if I were infected by the virus I would not need to worry, I would feel nothing, or at worst, I'd be affected by a gripezinha or a resfriadinho [a little cold, or sniffles].”However, Daví Alcolumbre, an opposition politician who leads the Senate and who tested positive for the virus last week, condemned Mr Bolsonaro’s address. “In this grave moment, the country needs serious, responsible leadership,” he said.Qantas secures $627m loan as coronavirus hits airlinesJamie Smyth reports from SydneyQantas Airways has raised A$1.05bn ($627m) in debt funding to strengthen its balance sheet as the aviation sector faces an unprecedented $250bn hit to revenues due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.The 10-year loan from a consortium of domestic and international banks is secured against part of the Australian carrier’s airline fleet at an interest rate of 2.75 per cent. It marks one of the first successful private debt raisings by an airline since governments worldwide began closing international borders over the past week, which has forced the industry to ground thousands of aircraft.The fund raising comes as global airlines scramble to slash costs and national governments prepare rescue packages to stave off a wave of bankruptcies in the sector. Corporate credit markets have tightened due to a liquidity squeeze and last week Moody’s put Qantas’s Baa2 credit rating under review for possible downgrade due to “unprecedented disruption to the airline industry”.Qantas has insisted it has enough cash to ride out the crisis.“Over the past few years we’ve significantly strengthened our balance sheet and we’re now able to draw on that strength under what are exceptional circumstances,” said Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive.Qantas has net debt of A$5.1bn, with no major debt securities until June 2021. The extra A$1.05bn in funding, which contains no financial covenants, increases the Group’s available cash balance to $2.95 billion with an additional $1 billion undrawn facility remaining available. Qantas said it has a further A$3.5bn in unencumbered assets.South Korean virus cases rise as Trump asks for helpBy Edward WhiteSouth Korea’s new coronavirus cases ticked higher again on Wednesday as the country struggles with one of the worst outbreaks in Asia and as US President Donald Trump approached Seoul for help.The Korea Centers for Disease Control reported 100 new cases, up from 76 on Tuesday, and taking the total infection caseload to 9,137. Six additional deaths were confirmed, pushing the death toll to 126.Overnight, Mr Trump spoke to Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, asking for medical equipment, according to South Korea’s presidential office. Mr Moon promised support but said US regulatory approvals may be needed.New infections in South Korea were outpaced by recovering patients with the latest tally showing 223 new recoveries taking the total to 3,730.While the number of new cases continues to frustrate South Korean officials, who have tightened controls on people arriving into the country and cracked down on public gatherings, the country continues to be an example of where mass testing, social distancing and contact tracing has helped to contain the outbreak.Japanese stocks jump following Wall Street leadBy Hudson Lockett and Leo LewisJapanese stocks exploded higher on a banner day for Asia-Pacific equities, as traders capitalised on momentum from Wall Street’s best day in more than a decade.The move was powerful enough, said traders, to ignore the first ever postponement of an Olympic Games, Tokyo’s sharpest spike in new coronavirus cases and a dismal slew of overnight news on the widening pandemic.Japan’s Topix benchmark stock index climbed 5.3 per cent, taking gains this week to about 9 per cent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 3.3 per cent and South Korea’s Kopsi index gained 4.5 per cent. China’s CSI 300 rose 2.5 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 3.1 per cent.Markets are increasingly putting faith in an unprecedented intervention by governments around the world, and the gains in Asia came as members of the US Congress said they were close to agreeing a nearly $2tn economic support package.Although none had been reached by market close on Tuesday, the prospect of a shot in the arm for the US economy drove the S&P 500 up 9.4 per cent by the close in the biggest one-day gain for the benchmark since 2008. Futures markets pointed to a dip of 0.7 per cent for US stocks later in the day.Oil prices also picked up on the prospect of a boost to demand from government support, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbing 3.3 per cent to $28.05 a barrel, while US marker West Texas Intermediate rose 3.6 per cent to $24.88.Mexico coronavirus cases rise to 405Jude Webber reports from Mexico CityMexico reported 405 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, 38 more than the previous day, and five deaths as authorities said the virus was spreading within the community.The health ministry said there were a further 1,219 suspected cases in the country.Latin America’s second-biggest economy began a nationwide social distancing campaign this week but President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has urged people not to panic. Over the weekend, he was still recommending families frequent local restaurants to keep the economy afloat.New Zealand declares state of emergencyJamie Smyth in SydneyNew Zealand has declared a state of national emergency, providing the authorities with greater powers to tackle the spread of the coronavirus across the Pacific nation.The declaration, which was made shortly after midday on Wednesday, followed a jump in the number of cases to 205, a rise of 50 cases in a day.Sarah Stuart-Black, director of civil defence emergency, told reporters the declaration would give authorities the power to close roads, stop people from doing activities that may spread the virus and bar people and traffic from certain areas. People should be going out for a reason such as a trip to the supermarket, ‘not just a bit of a mooch’, she said.“The state of national emergency has been declared because of the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic and to ensure the Government has the powers it needs to slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce its impact,"" said Ms Stuart-Black.New Zealand is due to outline the consequences for New Zealanders who do not abide by the tough new self-isolation and social distancing rules later on Wednesday or early Thursday, according to local media.Fitch cuts to negative part of €1.3tn European money market funds sectorSiobhan Riding reports from LondonFitch downgraded to negative its outlook for a large segment of the €1.3tn European money market fund sector in a sign that the problems that rocked funds last week were spreading across the Atlantic.The rating agency warned that heavy outflows from so-called low volatility net asset value funds were threatening the products’ liquidity positions, paving the way for potential fund suspensions.The funds, which invest in short-term corporate debt and commercial paper, suffered large investor withdrawals in the week to March 20 as a result of the coronavirus-induced market turmoil. Outflows from the funds denominated in US dollar and sterling reached their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, with dollar funds losing $46.9bn and sterling funds losing £16.6bn, according to Fitch.Stress in the European money market funds sector mirrors the situation for US prime funds, which experienced heavy withdrawals and declining liquidity levels last week. However, the rating agency said European funds faced additional risks relative to US counterparts because they did not benefit from the same kind of government support.Fitch said that while US funds run by Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon had benefited from liquidity injections from their parents, European money market funds were banned from receiving support from an affiliated entity.Asset sales undertaken by the European funds to meet redemptions depleted their weekly liquidity levels, with some funds temporarily falling below the 30 per cent regulatory threshold.Seven countries sign agreement to keep supply chains connectedStefania Palma reports from SingaporeSingapore, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Myanmar and New Zealand have signed an agreement to keep supply chains connected and trade lines open in a bid to counter the fallout from the coronavirus.“We affirm the importance of refraining from the imposition of export controls or tariffs and non-tariff barriers and of removing any existing trade restrictive measures on essential goods, especially medical supplies, at this time,” the joint statement said.The countries also committed to keeping “critical infrastructure” including air and seaports open to support global supply chains.The statement comes as some seaports suspend operations and land transport is disrupted by border controls, said a spokesperson at Singapore’s ministry of trade and industry. Airfreight charges have also jumped “multiple times” as mass flight cancellations squeeze airfreight capacity, they added.The agreement builds on a joint statement Singapore had initiated with New Zealand, which was issued last week.“Singapore welcomes other like-minded partners to join our continued efforts” to keep trade lines and supply chains functioning, the ministry spokesperson said.Carlos Slim donates $40m for medical equipment to fight coronavirusJude Webber reports from Mexico CityCarlos Slim, Mexico’s richest man, will donate 1bn pesos ($40m) through his charitable foundation for the purchase of medical equipment including ventilators for the fight against coronavirus.In conjunction with the education ministry, the PruebaT distance-learning platform developed by the foundation will be made available to students at state schools which have been closed nationwide.Employees of the telecom mogul’s Grupo Carso conglomerate will keep their jobs even if some activities are halted because of the coronavirus emergency, the foundation and Grupo Carso said in a statement.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador earlier praised Mr Slim for committing to firing no employee and urged other businesses to follow suit.Amazon and Flipkart suspend services in IndiaAmy Kazmin reports from New DelhiIndia’s largest ecommerce companies, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, as well as specialised online grocery firms such as Big Basket, have suspended all services amid massive confusion about whether they can operate during the country’s new 21-day lockdown period.The shutdowns have heightened concern among urban middle class Indians about the breakdown of food supply chains into cities, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Tuesday night television announcement ordering all of India’s 1.37bn people to stay home for the next 21 days.On its website, Big Basket, a major Indian online grocery company, informed its customers “we are not operational today due to restrictions by local authorities on movement of goods. We are working with the relevant authorities to enable delivery as soon as possible.”Amazon’s grocery service, Amazon Pantry was also suspended in the capital New Delhi.In a Tweet, Albinder Dhindsa, the founder of Grofers - another online grocery service, said that that the company’s app had collapsed under an unprecedented surge of orders on Tuesday night. Earlier on Tuesday, he tweeted that local police had shut down the Grofers warehouse which is typically used to supply around 20,000 households with essential items.In his Tuesday night speech, Mr Modi had assured Indians that essential supplies would remain available, but that Indians would have to rely on ecommerce companies and other home delivery services.Republicans and Democrats strike $2tn stimulus dealLauren Fedor reports from WashingtonRepublicans and Democrats have struck a $2tn deal to provide economic relief to taxpayers and businesses amid the coronavirus crisis, in what stands to be the largest congressional bailout in US history.After marathon negotiations on Capitol Hill stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters: “We are done. We have a deal.”Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor: “The Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on an historic relief package for this pandemic.”Mr McConnell had been wrangling with Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s most senior Democrat, since Saturday over Republicans’ proposals for the huge stimulus, which includes bailouts for large companies hit by the spread of coronavirus and means-tested “helicopter money” for US taxpayers.Three sailors on USS Theodore Roosevelt test positive for coronavirusJohn Reed reports from BangkokThree US sailors have tested positive for the coronavirus on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the South China Sea, the US Navy said, in the first case known of COVID-19 being found on a US military ship.The men were tested on Tuesday, and will be flown off the ship, which has about 5,000 people on board, it said.“Surveillance testing of three sailors was indicative of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” Lieutenant (junior grade) Rachel McMarr, a spokeswoman with the US Pacific Fleet said, confirming earlier statements by Navy officials.“The individuals are isolated in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines until the sailors can be flown off the ship.”Ms McMarr said that shipboard health workers were conducting “a thorough contact investigation” to determine whether any other sailors might have been in close contact with the three and possibly been exposed.The Navy did not specify the location of the ship, which called this month in Da Nang, Vietnam, but said it was in the Philippine or South China Sea.Europe: what you might have missedRepublicans and Democrats struck a $2tn deal to provide economic relief to taxpayers and businesses, in what stands to be the largest congressional bailout in US history.Singapore, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Myanmar and New Zealand signed an agreement to keep supply chains connected and trade lines open in a bid to counter the fallout from the coronavirus.New Zealand declared a state of national emergency, providing the authorities with greater powers to tackle the spread of the coronavirus across the Pacific nation.Japanese stocks exploded higher on a banner day for Asia-Pacific equities, as traders capitalised on momentum from Wall Street’s best day in more than a decade.Australian companies announced a swathe of layoffs on Wednesday with Virgin Australia and clothing retailer Mosaic Brands saying almost 15,000 workers will be stood down.Malaysia extends lockdown by two weeks after spike in casesStefania Palma reports from SingaporeMalaysia has extended its national lockdown by two weeks in a bid to contain a jump in coronavirus infections.The lockdown, originally set from March 18 to March 31, will run until April 14.""Just be mentally and physically prepared to stay at home for a reasonably longer period of time...I know you feel burdened but I don't have a choice,"" Muhyiddin Yassin, Malaysia's prime minister, said in a national address, adding the lockdown may be extended further if necessary.Malaysia's confirmed cases have more than doubled in just one week.

Interest in the drug surged after US President Donald Trump touted it as a potential treatment for coronavirus. Taken incorrectly, the drug can be lethal.Indian drugmakers IPCA Laboratories and Cadila Healthcare are two of the biggest producers of hydroxychloroquine, said pharma analyst Kunal Dhamesha at SBICap Securities.""In my view government would try to secure what India needs first, and then allow exports,"" said Mr Dhamesha, adding that ""demand will increase significantly in the US.""European markets set to rise after historic rallyEuropean stock futures climbed on Wednesday, leaving the continent's bourses set to push higher again after one of the best days on record.Futures tracking the composite Stoxx 600 rose 2 per cent, with the main indices in London and Frankfurt expected to rise by a similar margin.The Stoxx 600 soared 8.4 per cent on Tuesday, the third-biggest increase in a single day on records that stretch back to the 1980s.

It blamed the sharp reversal on a ¥390bn writedown involving its oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea after it downgraded its crude price assumptions following the recent collapse in oil prices.Marubeni also wrote down the value of its US-based grains merchant Gavilon, which it bought for $2.7bn in 2013, and of its Chilean copper mining business.TDK, the electronic components maker, also cut its full-year operating profit forecast by 21 per cent to ¥95bn, blaming falling sales in China due to the global pandemic.Oman Air to suspend flights from SundaySimeon Kerr in Dubai reports:Oman’s national carrier will suspend passenger flights from Sunday as the sultanate shuts down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to 99.Flights will end at noon on March 29 until further notice, the state news agency reported.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, has duly tabled a motion to put parliament into recess until April 21 – a week earlier than previously planned.Politicians and staff working on the parliamentary estate have been under pressure to work from home and their constituencies during the lockdown across the country. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle urged MPs this week to observe social distancing measures and called for legislation not to go to votes to avoid cramped scenes in division lobbies.Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC on Wednesday that today is likely to be the last day parliament sits. But he insisted “it will return” at an undeterminable point in the near future.It will return in the usual way after the Easter recess is over so that members of parliament can continue to hold the government and ministers like myself to account for the decisions we’re taking every day.”European regulator urges consistency in financial reportingMatthew Vincent reports:Europe’s securities regulator has urged companies to be consistent in their application of accounting rules amid the coronavirus outbreak.On Wednesday morning, the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority issued a statement instructing businesses to avoid divergence in the way they apply International Financial Reporting Standards - in particular IFRS 9. This standard requires companies to assess whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased over a reporting period.ESMA has said that since governments around the world have introduced economic support for businesses to lessen the impact of Covid-19 - such as suspension of loan and mortgage repayments - companies should not automatically assume there has been a significant increase in credit risk.According to the regulator, if the support measures provide temporary relief to debtors affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and the net economic value of the loan is not significantly affected, there should not be a big change to their accounting treatments.The European Banking Authority has also issued a related statement regarding the accounting implications of Covid-19, consistent with ESMA’s guidance on financial reporting.Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreadsSteve Bernard reports:The Covid-19 virus continued its spread yesterday with 43,769 cases diagnosed.

It does not apply to expatriates who make up around 70 per cent of the gulf country’s 4m population.Other gulf states have been unveiling similar measures to lighten the financial load of businesses.Bahrain plans a package equivalent to 30 per cent of gross domestic product, including paying private sector employees for three months and waiving utilities charges over the same period. United Arab Emirates has launched a $34bn stimulus to help banks to extend debt relief to retail and corporate customers and Saudi Arabia also unveiled a $32bn plan to support businesses.South Africa's central bank starts buying bondsJoseph Cotterill, Southern Africa bureau chief, reports:South Africa’s central bank said it would begin buying local government bonds to unblock strained money markets, as the country braces for a three-week lockdown of Africa's most industrialised economy.The central bank said on Wednesday that it would begin buying bonds on the secondary market as part of “providing liquidity and promoting the smooth functioning of domestic financial markets.”South African bonds rallied after the announcement, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government debt falling under 10 per cent.The central bank did not refer to the purchases as quantitative easing and previously said it would not launch unconventional monetary policy while interest rates are far above zero. South Africa’s benchmark interest rate is 5.25 per cent, following a 100 basis point cut by the bank last week.Bahrain to close non-essential businesses and limit outdoor activitiesSimeon Kerr in Dubai reports:Bahrain will close non-essential businesses from Thursday until April 9 as the small gulf monarchy escalates measures to fight coronavirus.Supermarkets, pharmacies and banks will remain open while restaurants will only be allowed to operate take away and delivery services. Essential workers have also been defined as manufacturers, mechanics, construction workers and those involved in the distribution of goods.The government also urged residents to stay at home unless they need to go to work or buy essential items. Exercise outside is to be limited to a maximum of two people, with no children allowed. Gatherings in front of homes are to be limited to no more than five people. The police have been deployed to enforce social distancing measures.Iran to impose new lockdown rulesMonavar Khalaj reports:Iran is set to impose further restrictions on public activities within the next two days, as the country is predicted to face a growing rate in cases.President Hassan Rouhani said “stricter” measures such as restrictions on travel would be imposed to further limit social contact among people.Millions of Iranians went on vacation as Iran celebrated the start of the New Year on March 20 despite the official calls on them to stay home. The government has said about 40 per cent of Iran’s 80m-strong population had travelled.Iran's health ministry said deaths had reached 2,077 on Wednesday, up from from 1,934 the day before.Sterling recovers more groundEva Szalay reports:The pound popped higher on Wednesday morning to trade at $1.1931, gaining 1.4 per cent against the dollar. Sterling also moved 1 per cent higher against the euro, which traded at £0.986.The recovery in sterling follows a week of heavy losses which pushed the exchange rate to its lowest since the 1980s at $1.1430. The pound is still down more than 5 per cent against the euro and over 6 per cent against the dollar since the start of the month.""After remarkable moves last week, sterling is taking a breather,"" said Chris Turner, a currency strategist at ING Bank in London. He added that the pound is attractive around current rates, but confidence in the global economy has to improve more before the currency can regain its footing above $1.20.The pound tumbled to its lowest level on record against the currencies of the UK’s major trading partners earlier this week.Sterling’s broad effective exchange rate, measured against a basket of currencies corresponding to the UK’s trade flows, hit a low of 72.9 on Tuesday, according to the daily reading compiled by the Bank of England. That is weaker than at any time during the Brexit process, the 2008-09 financial crisis or even the UK’s ejection from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992.Norway's financial regulator calls for banks to halt dividendsRichard Milne in Oslo reports:Norway's financial regulator has asked the government to ban banks and insurers from paying dividends until further notice as Nordic authorities seek to limit shareholder payouts.A day after Sweden's regulator urged its banks to not pay dividends, Norway's financial supervisory authority sent out a similar message that banks and insurers should do nothing to ""impair their financial strength"".Norway has been hit by a double crisis from coronavirus and the collapse in oil prices, leading its unemployment rate to more than quadruple over the past two weeks to the highest level since the second world war.""A ban on dividend payments and others distributions will have a profound impact. However, in view of the widespread crisis the country is in, the Financial Supervisory Authority is nevertheless of the opinion that such a measure is necessary to promote financial stability,"" it said on Wednesday.It added that the ban did not mean the dividends were ""confiscated"" but merely deferred until economic and financial conditions improved.Germany records 4,000 new casesTobias Buck in Berlin reports:Germany has recorded 4,118 new cases of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, taking the total number of reported cases to 31,554 since the crisis started.According to the latest official figures, the country has suffered 149 deaths as a result of Covid-19 - meaning Germany’s case fatality rate continues to be notably lower than in other countries.Health officials believe that the lower case fatality rate is mostly due to the large number of tests carried out in Germany, which means the country records more mild cases of coronavirus infections and has fewer undetected cases. But they also warn deaths are certain to rise in the days and weeks ahead.As in the past, the official German numbers were lower than those issued by Johns Hopkins University and other organisations, but the gap was less dramatic than in previous days. According to Johns Hopkins, Germany currently has 33,593 cases and 159 deaths.Lothar Wieler, the president of the RKI, had suggested earlier this week that there were signs that the growth rate of new infections was flattening. He sounded a more cautious note on Wednesday, however, saying that it was too early to make a definitive assessment.UK companies allowed 3-month extension for filing accountsMatthew Vincent in LondonBritish businesses will be allowed an extra three months to file their accounts with Companies House, to prevent them incurring penalties while they try to deal with the impact of the coronavirus.On Wednesday, the UK’s accounts registry and the business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the 4.3m businesses on the Companies House register could now apply for an extension for submitting their annual paperwork.Under the current rules, private companies must submit their annual accounts within nine months of their financial year-end, and public companies have six months. If they are late, private companies may be fined up to £1,500 for a six months delay, and public companies could be penalised up to £7,500.However, to assist them during the current disruption to business, they may now apply for a three-month extension, and those citing issues around Covid-19 will have it “automatically and immediately granted”. Applications may be made through a fast-tracked online system which Companies House says will take just 15 minutes to complete.Mr Sharma said:We are determined to help businesses in any way we can, so that they can focus all their efforts on dealing with the impact of Coronavirus, and this new offer of a three-month extension for filing accounts is part of that.Russian President Putin to give national address later todayHenry Foy in Moscow reports:Russian president Vladimir Putin will give a national address later on Tuesday concerning the spread of coronavirus in Russia after cancelling his scheduled meetings, his spokesman said.The address had been prompted by Mr Putin’s meetings on Monday where he was warned by a senior aide that official data showing a low number of Covid-19 cases was underestimating the outbreak and that the true spread was far worse.Local media in recent days has reported that the Kremlin is mulling a postponement of a national vote on April 22 where citizens will be asked to endorse sweeping changes to Russia’s constitution that would allow Mr Putin to rule for 12 additional years.“In the next few hours he will finalize the text of his address to citizens. This need has arisen after yesterday’s meetings” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “It will be broadcast on television literally in the coming hours.”Photo: APSaudi Arabia extends curfewAhmed Al Omran in Riyadh reports:Saudi Arabia extended its curfew and imposed more restrictions on domestic travel as the kingdom struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus.The official state news agency that King Salman has approved a ban on residents of the country’s 13 regions to move from one part of the country to another. The nighttime curfew that began Monday will now start at 3pm, instead of 7pm, in the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.The latest measures come after Saudi Arabia reported the first death from Covid-19 and 205 new cases on Tuesday, the highest increase in a single day since the kingdom announced its first case on March 2.India’s virus battle shows struggle of global southThe FT View:India has put 1.4bn inhabitants under quarantine — probably the largest exercise in history. Its struggle to contain the outbreak is emblematic of special challenges facing much of the developing world. Its response will carry lessons for others.Over the past week Indian states have enacted progressively stricter laws, especially on travel. While it is far from alone in having been slow to tackle the virus, India’s abrupt, dramatic lockdown risks already being too late.Western countries’ experiences with Covid-19 are already harrowing, with medical systems stretched beyond breaking point. Without the very best health responses, and outside help, the impact of the pandemic on the emerging world could prove immeasurably worse.Read full story herePrince of Wales tests positive for virusRobert Wright reports:The British heir to the throne has become the most prominent public figure in the UK to be confirmed as having Coronavirus, as officials confirmed Prince Charles had tested positive for Covid-19.In a statement, Clarence House, the Prince's official residence, said the prince, 71, had tested positive.He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.The prince's wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, had also been tested but did not have the virus, the statement added. The pair were tested by the National Health Service in Aberdeenshire, where the prince has a residence at Birkhall, on the queen's Balmoral estate.""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland"" the statement said.Clarence House added that it was impossible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus because of the large number of public engagements he had undertaken in recent weeks.G20 leaders to meet via videolink to coordinate responseGuy Chazan in Berlin reports:Saudi Arabia is to host a G20 video conference on the coronavirus pandemic, Angela Merkel's spokesman said.The virtual meeting will take place on Thursday from 13:00 to 14:30 German time.Ms Merkel, who is in self-isolation after coming into contact with someone who was infected with the coronavirus, will take part.The aim was to plan a ""coordinated response of the G20"" to the global crisis. ""It's absolutely correct, in view of the enormous global effects [of the pandemic] that the G20 want to coordinate their actions internationally,"" Steffen Seibert, Ms Merkel's spokesman, said on Wednesday.Researchers at Oxford compare stringency of 73 countries' measuresAndrew Jack reports:Countries around the world differ widely in the measures taken in response to coronavirus and the speed with which they were adopted, with Croatia currently among the most stringent and the US much more relaxed, according to a tracker launched by a team of researchers at Oxford University.The analysis by the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford is assessing 73 countries according to a scale of their response, focusing on 11 measures, including restrictions on movement, school and workplace closures, policies on mass gatherings, fiscal and monetary measures and investments in vaccines and emergency healthcare.The study, which is being regularly updated, stresses the complexity of assessing measures and converting them into a single index, and is not making a judgement on the effectiveness of the different approaches. But it will provide a baseline for comparison of public health outcomes.""There is significant variation in both the measures that governments adopt and when they adopt them,"" it concludes. The US and Germany are among the lowest scoring in terms of stringency.UK records nearly half a million Universal Credit claims in nine daysChris Giles in LondonThe scale of the coming surge in unemployment was laid bare in Parliament on Wednesday with officials saying almost half a million people had claimed universal credit in the past nine days.Speaking to the Work and Pensions Committee, Peter Schofield, the top official at the Department for Work and Pensions said that since 16 March, 477,000 had registered online for the UK's main safety net benefit.With 105,000 registering on Tuesday this week alone, Mr Schofield said the ""system is working"" and urged MPs not to try to change the benefit in the short term because it could cope with large numbers, but not if the system needed reprogramming.About a quarter of the people who registered last week asked for advance payments, indicating that the majority did not face immediate need for cash, but the scale of the increase was enormous, officials and the secretary of state admitted.The number of claims in nine days is almost exactly equal to the fall of unemployment over the past five years and it stood at 1.34m at the turn of the year.UK companies given extra month to pay dividendsDaniel Thomas in London reports:British companies have been given an extra month to pay dividends by the London Stock Exchange in a bid to ease the burden on businesses facing a cash flow crisis owing to the coronavirus outbreak.The LSE said that companies would be given an extra 30 days, after which the dividend must be paid or cancelled. “If any dividend is to be cancelled and not paid, this should be notified by the issuer without delay,” it said.More than a dozen companies in the UK - and many more around the world - have already cancelled their final dividends as they seek to ensure enough cash stays on balance sheets to see them through the crisis.“As a result of market conditions and issuers implementing their contingency plans, the Exchange has received enquiries from issuers and their advisers regarding deferral or cancellation of their dividend payments”, it said in a statement.The Exchange continues to closely monitor the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and is considering all available options to ensure markets continue to function well and to support market participants.Tiny UK diagnostics firm to deploy simple coronavirus test in 8 weeksAndy Bounds in ManchesterA tiny British diagnostics company said it was eight weeks away from deploying a simple coronavirus test, more than tripling its share price in morning trading.Genedrive in Manchester said it could make more than 10,000 tests an hour for use in standard laboratory equipment worldwide. It is also working on a second test which could be used outside hospitals in health clinics and GP surgeries to see if patients had the disease. Lack of testing has forced hundreds of millions worldwide to isolate themselves because they do not know whether they could infect others.Genedrive, which already produces a Hepatitis C test administered on a handheld device, also said it had just clinched a deal with the US Department of Defense to supply 500 detectors for biological warfare agents.The shares started the day at 9p and hit 32p at one stage. At 10.50am they were at 28.5p.Spain's Covid-19 death toll exceeds that of ChinaDaniel Dombey in MadridOver 700 people have died in the past 24 hours in Spain after contracting the coronavirus as the pandemic continues to rip through the country.According to figures released by the health ministry on Wednesday, 3,434 people have died so far, compared with 2,696 on Tuesday. This means that the virus has now killed more people in Spain than it has in China, the original source of the outbreak, where almost 3,300 people have died. Only in Italy, where to date almost 7,000 people have died, has coronavirus been more lethal so far.Authorities in Spain say they hope this week will mark the peak of transmission of the virus, although the surge in deaths and intensive care cases is likely to come one to two weeks later.At present there are a total of 47,610 confirmed cases of the virus, a 20 per cent increase on Tuesday’s figures, while there are 3,166 people in intensive care, also a 20 per cent increase. The ministry said 5,367 people had now recovered, a 40 per cent jump from 24 hours before.European stocks shed big gains and turn lowerEuropean equities markets took a turn for the worse in late-morning dealings, with major indices sliding into negative territory.The broad Stoxx 600 was down 0.4 per cent in recent trade, having been up 4.8 per cent at its peak. London's FTSE 100 fell 0.5 per cent, also shedding significant gains from earlier in the day.S&P 500 futures also hit their lows for the day, leaving them down 1.2 per cent.The declines on Wednesday, which follow a historic rally the previous day, highlight the tumult that has taken hold of global financial markets.Mali reports first caseNeil Munshi, west Africa correspondent, reports:Mali has reported its first coronavirus cases, becoming the 44th country to record a case in Africa which has seen its spread speed up in recent days.Health experts have warned that Africa is the region least prepared to deal with the pandemic because of widespread equipment shortages and generally weak healthcare infrastructure. The continent now has roughly 2,400 cases and many countries have implemented stringent social distancing restrictions.But testing capacity is limited in most countries and there are questions about whether lockdowns are feasible in places where many people live hand to mouth and must work each day in order to feed themselves and their families.Mali is currently at the centre of roiling violence that has left more than 1m people displaced in the western Sahel, where humanitarian actors have raised concerns about the virus' potential spread in crowded refugee camps.So far most cases in Africa are connected to people returning from Europe, though instances of community transmission are increasing. Both cases in Mali involved people who had returned from France in recent weeks.UK virus modeller says health service can cope under new strategyCamilla Hodgson in London reports:The author of a landmark study which warned that the UK’s coronavirus strategy would overwhelm the health service and result in more than 500,000 deaths has said the NHS will now be able to cope under the revised plan.On Wednesday, Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said the current stricter social distancing policies meant intensive care units would “get very close to capacity” but would not “be breached at a national level.”Prof Ferguson led the research team which found that the UK’s former, more relaxed mitigation policy would lead to eight out of 10 people becoming infected with Covid-19, and 510,000 deaths. The paper helped convince Number 10 to adopt a much more aggressive method of containing the disease, which was stepped up this week to a nationwide lockdown.“We are reasonably confident that at a national level we will be at capacity,” he said, though caveated that this was only a prediction. He said he expected that, given the current lockdown strategy, the majority of the population would not become infected. However, up to “5-10 per cent” of London’s population could become infected in the next few months.Prof Ferguson said he expected ICU demand to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, because the more stringent measures put in place this week would not begin to show their effects immediately. That is because many of the people who will be ill in two weeks are already infected.150,000 people sign up to help health service in UK150,000 have signed up to help the UK health service during the virus pandemic, less than 24 hours after the government put out a call for volunteers.Britain's National Health Service faces a severe strain, with the number of cases needing hospitalisation expected to rise sharply in the coming weeks.150,000 Britons have already volunteered to help the NHS through the coronavirus crisis!

We can not deny the delay in preparation of medical supplies into the country due to this inhumane behaviour.Imports of food and medicine are not subject to sanctions. But Iran says restrictions introduced after US President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal agreed between the Islamic republic and world powers have frequently delayed imports because they have cut it off from the international financial system.Many nurses and physicians have complained of a lack of equipment and support since the first cases of the virus were officially reported in Iran on February 19.Germans hoard household goodsMartin Arnold in Frankfurt reports:German hoarding of household goods in response to the coronavirus led to an eight-fold increase in sales of disinfectant in the country earlier this month, according to new data collected by the federal statistics agency.Sales of other products, such as soap, toilet roll, flour and pasta, have also surged in Germany as people responded to the pandemic by hoarding, or as the Germans call it Hamsterkäufe, which means shopping like hamsters.Disinfectant sales shot up across the country in the first week of March, before falling dramatically last week after shelves were emptied of the products, according to the statistics agency.Meanwhile, soap sales quadrupled last week, while toilet paper and rice sales trebled and tinned tomato sales more than doubled. The week before, sales of other products that people tend to stockpile in times of crisis had doubled, such as flour, yeast and pasta.Drink producers face going bust after government collects alcohol dutyJudith Evans in LondonThousands of small breweries and wine and spirits companies in the UK say they may go out of business after the government decided to collect alcohol duty payments as usual on Wednesday despite the coronavirus crisis.The tax, which raises more than £10bn a year, is levied on producers and importers, but local alcohol producers had asked for a suspension of quarterly payments due on Wednesday after pubs and restaurants were closed, cutting into sales.The Society of Independent Brewers said thousands of companies were at risk. The Campaign for Real Ale said: “This could have meant the difference between many hundreds of independent breweries standing a chance of surviving this crisis, or closing their operations permanently and never reopening.”Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association,said: “Many businesses will [now] be faced with the extremely hard decision of whether to pay tax bills or pay staff.”London underground passenger numbers drop by 90 per centThe number of London’s tube commuters has fallen by 90 per cent following government instructions to curtail all non-essential travel to limit the spread of the coronavirus.There had been concerns that many workers were still commuting into the city amid scenes of over-crowding this week, but data from Wednesday morning indicated that travel on the underground had fallen by a third compared to the previous day. Bus journeys were down by 20 per cent.“The network is to be used by critical care workers only,” said Andy Lord, managing director of the London Underground in a statement.The majority of people are playing their part and avoiding travel, but more people need to stop travelling immediately to save lives.We want to continue to run a core Tube service so that NHS staff and other key workers can make essential journeys. Around a third of our own staff are themselves ill or have to self-isolate, so we are simply not able to run a full service.Lancet editor warns over quality of NHS protective equipmentCamilla Hodgson in London reports:The editor in chief of the prestigious Lancet medical journal has warned that the protective equipment being sent to frontline NHS workers is not fit for purpose.Speaking to a House of Commons committee on Wednesday, Dr Richard Horton said the availability of personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, had increased in recent days. But he warned that some of the equipment was “not of a high standard” and some boxes of supplies had arrived with stickers on them that showed they had passed their expiry dates.The equipment being sent to doctors and nurses is “putting health workers at risk,” he said. “That seems to me not what we should be doing.”NHS COVID-19 UPDATE: “Totally inadequate PPE.

She also asked universities to delay the start of classes from early April, which is the start of the new school year for Japan.Netherlands detects Covid-19 in sewage systemMehreen Khan in BrusselsThe Netherlands public health authority has found evidence of Covid-19 virus in the country's sewage system and recommended testing sewer water to gauge the spread of the pandemic.Dutch authorities on Wednesday said they found the presence of the virus's DNA in waterworks four days after the country's first reported case on February 27. The virus is likely to have come from infected stool samples entering the sewage system through people's toilets.The Netherlands public health authority has used methods on water samples to detect other forms of bacteria like polio and measles. They warned that sewage workers should take extra health precautions and suggested that the presence of the virus in the waterworks can act as a proxy for the spread of the disease in the country.States ask EU for 'bold decisions' on fiscal policyDaniel Dombey, Madrid and Guy Chazan, BerlinNine EU states, including France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have called on the bloc to take “bold decisions on fiscal policy... to buttress our economies”, including the “activation of all existing common fiscal instruments... and a common debt instrument”, while calling for Brussels to lay out a clear European strategy to fight the pandemic.A letter to Charles Michel, president of the European council, from the leaders of Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain argues that the “case for such a common instrument is strong, since we are all facing a symmetric external shock, for which no country bears responsibility, but whose negative consequences are endured by all.”It adds: ""This common debt instrument should have sufficient size and long maturity to be fully efficient and avoid roll-over risks now as in the future."" However, Germany and other northern European countries have resisted such moves.Asked about eurobonds, Dennis Kolberg, a German finance ministry spokesman, said Berlin had:Already agreed a comprehensive package of measures and there is an ambitious, targeted programme on the European level.... We have with the ESM a powerful, functioning and tried and tested tool which can provide support forcefully and quickly...We have already agreed on significant measures, we are talking to each other about what we still need to do, beyond the massive package that has been put together on the national, European and international level.Spain and Italy are the two EU countries worst hit by the coronavirus so far, with the highest death tolls not just in Europe but the world. A total of more than 10,000 people have died in the two countries to date.The letter also says that EU countries “need to make sure that essential value chains can fully function within the EU borders and that no strategic assets fall prey of hostile takeovers during this phase of economic difficulties.”It calls for the European Commission to provide ""agreed guidelines, a common base for the collection and sharing of medical and epidemiological information, and a strategy to deal in the near future with the staggered evolution of the epidemic.And signatories will ""put all our efforts to guarantee the production and distribution of key medical equipment and protections, to deliver them in an affordable and timely manner where they are most needed.”Softbank attacks Moody's after debt downgradeKana Inagaki in Tokyo, Arash Massoudi and Robert Smith in LondonSoftBank has demanded that Moody's remove all of its bond and currency ratings on the Japanese conglomerate, after the rating agency issued a two-notch downgrade that cut its debt deeper into junk status. The group led by Masayoshi Son immediately accused Moody’s of making its decision based on “biased and mistaken views”.The unusual demand came just two days after SoftBank said it planned to sell $41bn in assets to pay down its heavy debt load and fund a share buyback. Those actions have triggered a 55 per cent jump in SoftBank shares, which touched a four-year low last week as investors panicked over its hefty debt exposure. “[SoftBank Group] believes that Moody’s ratings action is based on excessively pessimistic assumptions regarding the market environment and misunderstanding that SBG will quickly liquidate assets without any thorough consideration,” the company said. Read more hereUK regulator admits some Libor switch deadlines may be missedMatthew Vincent in London reports:Britain’s financial regulator has admitted that some deadlines for companies to stop using the tainted Libor lending benchmark may be missed because of coronavirus.In an update on transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday that the pandemic was having “an impact on the timing” of firms switching to alternative rates. It concluded:In segments of the UK market that have made less progress in transition and are therefore still more reliant on Libor, such as the loan market, it is likely to affect some of the interim transition milestones.Libor underpins the pricing of up to $400tn-worth of products around the world but a series of scandals over how it was set damaged trust in its use.Companies had been due to stop issuing new lending or derivative products linked to Libor by the end of September this year, and to switch all existing contracts and lending arrangements to other risk-free rates by the end of 2021.However, the FCA insisted that the 2021 final deadline had not changed. Phil Lloyd, head of market structure of NatWest Markets said: “The main message coming across loud and clear is to keep planning for the end of Libor as before.UK urged to look ahead to organise vaccine manufacturingCamilla Hodgson in London reports:The UK government should be looking at where a potential vaccine for coronavirus could be manufactured, disease specialists told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.Dr Melanie Saville, director of Vaccine Research and Development at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said identifying manufacturing facilities is something policymakers should be doing today if not “yesterday,” even though a Covid-19 vaccine has not yet been developed.Waiting for a vaccine to be ready before finding manufacturing capacity “will delay the process for 6 months to a year,” she said. A facility will need to be able to produce and quality control the product.Also giving evidence, Andrew Pollard, professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity at the University of Oxford, said the UK government had invested in a new domestic manufacturing facility - a project that was started before the coronavirus outbreak - but that the scheme was “only just starting.”Portugal's first budget surplus as democracy set to be short-livedPeter Wise in Lisbon reports:Portugal has posted its first budget surplus in almost half a century of democracy, recording a surplus of 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product for 2019. But the former bailout country expects to return to a deficit this year because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Statistics Portugal (INE) said on Wednesday the budget was estimated to have moved from a deficit of 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2018 to a surplus of 0.2 per cent, or €404m, last year. It is the first time Portugal has posted a budget surplus since 1973, the year before an almost bloodless revolution restored democracy after 48 years of authoritarian rule.The government had forecast a small budget deficit in 2019 and a 0.2 per cent of GDP surplus this year. However, António Costa, the prime minister, said this week Portugal would almost certainly not achieve a surplus in 2020 because of the damage the pandemic was inflicting on the economy and the need to support the health service, companies and jobs.The surplus reflects a remarkable turnround since the deep recession triggered by the European debt crisis, which in 2011 forced Portugal to negotiate a €78bn bailout from the EU and the IMF. In the same year, the Lisbon government posted a budget deficit equivalent to 11.2 per cent of GDP.Portugal has also made progress in reducing one of the highest levels of public debt in the EU. According to INE, the debt fell to 117.7 per cent of GDP last year, down from 122 per cent in 2018.Corbyn criticises Johnson's handling of the crisisGeorge Parker, political editor, reports:Jeremy Corbyn has used his last stint as Labour leader at prime minister’s questions to criticise Boris Johnson’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.Mr Corbyn said the government should have ordered more testing equipment for the virus “weeks or months ago” and denounced the shortage of protective equipment for health and care workers.Mr Johnson said testing was being increased from 5,000 tests a day to 10,000 and then 25,000 and insisted the government had been focused on the issue “for weeks and weeks”.The Army was helping to deliver protective equipment to hospitals. Mr Johnson said 7.5m pieces of equipment had been delivered in the past 24 hours.AFPCoronavirus: free to readThe Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to keep everyone informed during this extraordinary crisis.

The move comes just days after activist investor Carl Icahn reached a truce with the company’s board.Occidental said capex in 2020 would now be $2.7bn to $2.9bn, down another 20 per cent from the $3.5bn to $3.7bn announced on March 10; and almost a halving from the $5.2bn to $5.4bn in its original budget for the year.Annual production would be beneath 1.3m barrels a day, or 6 per cent lower than planned, it said. Corporate and operating costs would be $600m lower, on top of $1.1bn the company already announced.The company slashed its dividend by 90 per cent earlier this month. Last week rating agency S&P downgraded $37bn of its debt to junk status, citing the high leverage Occidental has taken on since buying Anadarko for $56bn last summer.Its share price has fallen about 70 per cent in the past three weeks and its market capitalisation is now less than $10bn, compared with $42bn just before the deal to buy Anadarko in August 2019.Support for UK self-employed to be announced tomorrowGeorge Parker, political editor, reports:Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce a new package of help for the self-employed tomorrow.Earlier, Boris Johnson promised a package of measures to help the self-employed through the coronavirus crisis “in the next couple of days”, as MPs criticised what they claimed was a tardy response.Mr Johnson said he shared the desire of Ian Blackford, SNP Westminster leader, to give self-employed workers “parity of support” with those in employment.Mr Blackford, speaking at prime minister’s questions, said the measures should have been in place before the prime minister ordered a “lockdown”.First batch of Chinese medical supplies arrives in PakistanFarhan Bokhari in Islamabad reports:China’s first plane-load of medical supplies to help Pakistan combat the coronavirus arrived in Karachi on Wednesday, as health officials in Islamabad reported that nearly one thousand people had been infected. At least seven people infected by the virus have so far died in Pakistan.A senior government official told the FT that Beijing had promised to deliver at least 12,000 kits for testing of coronavirus patients and more than 1.6m protective masks. “We expect more cargo flights from China in the coming days. We also expect China to deliver ventilators and there will also be Chinese doctors coming to aid Pakistan,” he said.Beijing’s role in helping Pakistan cope with the crisis has increased China’s already-widespread influence in the country as Islamabad’s main military and economic ally. On Wednesday, Pakistan ordered the suspension of all domestic flights following an earlier order to shut down international flights, train services and buses running between cities.Prime minister Imran Khan’s government, along with provincial administrations, has already enforced a lockdown across Pakistan. But critics say the country needs to quickly adopt harsher measures including tight curfews to minimise the risk of a further spread of the infection.“The government is still behind the times that we live in,” said one opposition leader who spoke to the FT. “The prime minister has not shown the wisdom to pick up the phone, call up opposition leaders and ask them for support to this common cause. It's a national issue and we need nationwide unity”.Sweden bucks global trend with ‘experimental’ virus strategyRichard Milne in OsloSweden has become an international outlier in its response to the coronavirus outbreak by keeping schools open and adopting few other restrictions, as the Scandinavian nation embarks on what one health expert called a “huge experiment”.Sweden is the largest European country with the fewest limits on where people can go and what they can do. Schools for children up to the age of 16 remain open, many people continue to go to work and packed commuter trains and buses were reported this week in the capital Stockholm.Johan Carlson, head of Sweden’s public health agency, last week defended Sweden’s approach, saying the country “cannot take draconian measures that have a limited impact on the epidemic but knock out the functions of society.”However, some epidemiologists believe the authorities are taking huge risks. “We have no idea — it could work out. But it could also go crazily in the wrong direction,” said Joacim Rocklov, an epidemiologist at Umea University.Read the full story here.European markets slip back into positive as sentiment strengthensEuropean equity markets have wobbled back into positive territory in early afternoon trading, as investors reacted to leaders in Washington agreeing a $2tn stimulus package to shore up the US economy.The broad Stoxx 600 is up 1 per cent, following a short dip into negative territory in late morning trading. London's FTSE 100 and the French CAC index are both up 1.13 and 1.35 per cent respectively. Germany's Dax has slipped to minus 1.05 per cent after gaining as much as 2.7 per cent in early morning trading.Wall Street looks set to open lower after the S&P had its best day in more than a decade on Tuesday. Futures markets point to a loss of more than 1 per cent for the benchmark index when it opens for trading.Market fluctuations throughout the day on Wednesday reflect wider uncertainty felt by global investors.Target sales surge on virus related panic buyingTarget said it would scale back on planned investments and as it reported an ""unprecedented sales"" surge in March as consumers stocked up on food, beverages, cleaning products and pantry items amid the coronavirus pandemic.Same-store sales, a measure of sales in locations open at least a year, jumped 20 per cent from a year ago in the March-to-date period, the retailer said on Wednesday.That was boosted by a more than 50 per cent jump in comparable sales in essentials and food and beverages categories. ""Strength also emerged"" in areas that support in-home activities, including home office and entertainment. However, sales in clothing and accessories fell 20 per cent from a year ago.The company also said it expected higher first-quarter costs in part because of increased pay and improved benefits for its staff.Target said it would remodel only about 130 stores this year, down from its previous goal of about 300 previously, as it tried to minimise disruptions and focus on meeting consumer demand.Target also withdrew its prior guidance first-quarter and full-year earnings and sales guidance, citing ""uncertain outlook for consumer shopping patterns and government policy related to Covid-19"".Ukraine declares state of emergency as it extends quarantineRoman Olearchyk reports from Kyiv:Ukraine has declared a nationwide state of emergency and prolonged a quarantine imposed earlier this month for another 30 days in a bid to prevent a spike of Covid-19 cases that could overwhelm the country’s healthcare system.There have been 113 confirmed infections in the eastern European country, with the disease affecting 13 of 27 regions as well as the capital Kyiv, prime minister Denys Shmygal said during a televised cabinet meeting. Four people have died.“The statistics continue to worsen,” Mr Shmygal said. He and his cabinet were all wearing protective masks at Wednesday's meeting, television footage showed.Earlier this month the country closed schools, restaurants, shopping malls, banned mass gatherings and shut down regular passenger flights while also prohibiting visits from foreign tourists.Two senior ministers in past days called for deeper restrictions including the closure of all non-strategic businesses and factories while empowering enforcement of nationwide lockdowns through martial law.Following strong opposition from business lobby groups and the nation’s top investor, steel giant ArcelorMittal, such plans were dropped.The state of emergency, Mr Shmygal said on Wednesday, “does not restrict the constitutional rights of citizens, but only consolidates efforts to overcome the threat.”UK extends right to remain for foreign nationals affected by coronavirusAndrew Jack in LondonThe British government has extended, to the end of May, the right to remain in the UK for foreign nationals whose visas have expired but who are self-isolating or unable to travel because of coronavirus.It also granted the right for people to switch their immigration status while in the UK, such as from student to worker.The move follows pressure from groups including universities, which have been concerned about the status of a large number of students from outside the EU left stranded by the pandemic.""Those who contact the Home Office for these visa extensions will be expected to return to their home countries as soon as possible once flight and border restrictions are lifted,"" the Home Office said.City of London offers rent relief for tenants under pressureGeorge Hammond in LondonThe City of London Corporation has agreed to defer three months rental payment for tenants of the Square Mile, but stopped short of offering businesses a rent-free period.The deferral will apply to a certain small office tenants and all of those in serviced offices, as well as all retail businesses, leisure businesses, restaurants and bars forced to close as a result of the nationwide shutdown due to the coronavirus. It comes as quarterly rent payments are due today.Catherine McGuinness, the Corporation's policy chair, said: “We recognise that many businesses based in the Square Mile are facing almost impossible trading conditions as a result of the current Covid-19 outbreak. It is only right that we stand by these tenants by offering much-needed rental relief.”Other landlords in the capital have gone further. Last week, King's Cross landlord Argent offered tenants three months rent-free, and the Grosvenor and Cadogan estates have made similar offers to their smaller retail and food and beverage tenants.Putin postpones vote to extend his ruleHenry Foy in Moscow reports:Russian president Vladimir Putin has postponed a nationwide vote that was set to extend his rule by 12 years, bowing to increased pressure to delay after being warned that the coronavirus outbreak in the country was far worse than his government's data suggested.Mr Putin, who had earlier vowed that the April 22 vote on changes to the constitution would go ahead and stressed that the virus spread was ""under control"", used a nationwide address on Tuesday to announce his U-turn, hours after the number of Covid-19 cases in Russia jumped by a third.""You know how seriously I feel about this [vote],"" Mr Putin said, in a sombre speech. ""However, our absolute priority is the health and safety of our people, which is why I think is necessary to move the vote to a later date.""Mr Putin said a new date would be chosen once the scale of the outbreak was better understood.""It is impossible to block the virus from entering our state. What we can do, we are already doing... The main priority is the life and health of our citizens,"" he added.On Monday the mayor of Moscow and Mr Putin's former chief of staff used a televised meeting with the president to warn him that the number of people infected was “far more” than his government was admitting, and that the healthcare system threatened to be overrun.Russia has reported far fewer cases than all other major European countries, and the Kremlin has sought to play down the threat of the pandemic with one eye on the scheduled vote next month.If endorsed by a majority of the public, the constitutional changes would reset his presidential terms to zero, allowing him to run twice more after 2024, when he will have completed four terms as president.BBC suspends plans for major restructuringMark Di Stefano in London reports:The BBC’s director general Sir Tony Hall has suspended plans for a sweeping restructure of the news division, which was to see cuts to services and hundreds of workers lose their jobs, as the broadcaster covers the outbreak of coronavirus around the world.Sir Tony Hall told staff in an internal call on Wednesday that consultations for the proposed cuts would be suspended for the time being, according to two people familiar with the matter.Earlier this year, the BBC announced the broadcaster would need to make another £40m worth of cuts to make a 2022 savings target, which included 450 employees losing their jobs.It was being led by the BBC’s editorial director Kamal Ahmed, who had proposed a more centralised story-commissioning structure. The most high-profile casualty of the plans was to be BBC2’s Victoria Derbyshire programme, which was to be taken off air and potentially made into a digital-only product.Sir Tony's move to put the plans on ice was welcomed by insiders at the public broadcaster. The BBC has seen record-high audience numbers across radio, TV and online, during the coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with many producers and journalists required to attend work during the quarantine.UK at-home antibody tests expected within weeksCamilla Hodgson reportsMembers of the British public will be able to order home testing kits to screen for the coronavirus within weeks, according to Public Health England.Giving evidence to a parliamentary committee, Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said an antibody test — which would be able to tell whether someone had contracted and recovered from the virus — was being assessed by scientists in Oxford. She said she expected the analysis of the test's accuracy to be ready by the end of the week.Prof Peacock said the government had already ordered 3.5m tests and was in the process of ordering “millions more.”Once researchers are confident that the tests work, they will be available to the general public from retailers such as Amazon and the chemist Boots. Whether there will be a charge for the test — an at-home blood test that will look similar to a pregnancy test — has not yet been decided.“In the near future people will be able to order a home test,” said Prof Peacock. PHE will conduct a study, by going into people’s homes, to ensure that the tests are working correctly, she added.Wall Street edges higher after congress agrees US stimulus dealUS stocks extended gains in early trading in the wake of US congressional leaders agreeing a $2tn stimulus deal to support the economy and financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.The S&P 500 was up 2 per cent shortly after the opening bell on Wednesday. The move is, thus far, more muted than the 9.4 per cent rise the benchmark clocked yesterday, its biggest one-day gain since 2008, when investors anticipated lawmakers would sign off on the stimulus measures.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.7 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best with a 3.5 per cent advance.Government bonds were steady. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was flat at 0.82 per cent.Israel prepares to enter one-week lockdownMehul Srivastava in Tel Aviv reports:Israel will be locked down for a week starting this evening, with citizens banned from walking more than 100 meters from their homes, barring exceptions for buying food, medicine or heading to work in an essential sector.Synagogues will be shut around the country, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally wrestled his health minister, a devout ultra-orthodox member of parliament, into complying with the demands of the medical community.Just under a third of Israel's infections have originated from visitors to synagogues, according to an advisory body to the health ministry, excluding those who caught it abroad or from a family member.The number of Israelis diagnosed with the coronavirus doubled in the last three days to 2,170, with fewer than five dead. But Mr Netanyahu has warned his cabinet that the number of infections could eventually reach as high as a million, resulting in nearly ten thousand dead, according to local television channels.The Israeli military has prepared eight infantry battalions to assist the police in maintaining the lockdown, and keep essential services like grocery stores and pharmacies open, a spokesman said. They have not yet been deployed.Israel was amongst the first nations to put all international travellers into a 14 day quarantine, trying to choke off infections from abroad. Since then, Mr Netanyahu has shuttered non-essential businesses, and unemployment has surged to nearly 20 percent.US: what you might have missedThe virus has now killed more people in Spain than it has in China, the original source of the outbreak. Over 700 people have died in the past 24 hours in Spain, taking the country’s total deaths to 3,434. Worldwide, there have now been more than 424,000 cases and nearly 19,000 deaths.UK prime minister Boris Johnson has defended his handling of the crisis. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government should have ordered more testing equipment for the virus “weeks or months ago”.Unprecedented lockdowns continue to roll around the globe. Saudi Arabia has extended its curfew, Iran has tougher promised travel restrictions and in Australia some funerals will be live-streamed after new limits were put on attendance. Tokyo’s governor has asked the population of the world’s largest city to stay at home this weekend.On Wall Street, stocks have added to the previous session’s strong gains as investors welcomed a $2tn stimulus deal to provide economic relief to American taxpayers and businesses.The British heir to the throne, Prince Charles, has become the most prominent public figure in the UK to be confirmed as having coronavirus. He is said to be suffering mild symptoms.US urges Saudi Arabia to stabilise energy markets ahead of G20Katrina Manson, US foreign policy and defence correspondentAmerica’s top diplomat has appealed to Saudi Arabia to help stabilise energy markets ahead of a meeting of G20 leaders as the coronavirus pandemic upturns the world economy.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday about “the need for all countries to work together to contain the pandemic” and “to maintain stability in global energy markets amid the worldwide response”, according to a US state department statement.The US effort to intervene in global oil markets comes after Saudi Arabia raised oil production earlier this month, triggering a price war with Russia that has roiled markets at a time when they are struggling to cope with the impact of Covid-19.A senior state department official said last week the excess oil supply only “exacerbates” existing challenges countries faced as they tried to respond to the pandemic. The official added that multiple oil companies and lawmakers had lobbied the Trump administration to intervene.Riyadh is due to host a virtual assembly of G20 leaders on Thursday to advance what it described as “a coordinated global response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its human and economic implications”.US, Spain and Italy consolidate positions as global virus hotspotsSteve Bernard in LondonThe Covid-19 focal point shifted first from China to Italy, but in recent days Spain and the US have seen more cases than any other country.In the past seven days the total number of cases in the US has risen from less than 10,000 to stand at the current total of 55,081.Today, Spain saw its cases increase by 5,552 and now has a higher death toll than China, with 3,434 dying from the virus.Judge denies Julian Assange's bail applicationJane Croft reports:Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who is fighting extradition to the US, has failed in an attempt to be freed on bail from a London prison after claiming he was at high risk of coronavirus.Mr Assange's legal team applied to Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday for him to be released on bail from Belmarsh prison in London on the grounds he would be vulnerable to the virus because of his poor health. However, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser refused Mr Assange's bail application. The case comes amid concerns about the growing spread of Covid-19 in Britain's overcrowded prison system.Mr Assange has been held in Belmarsh prison, a high security jail, since last year when he finished serving a 50-week sentence for violating his 2012 bail conditions. He completed that sentence last year but has remained in prison pending an extradition hearing in May which will decide whether he can be extradited to stand trial in the US on spying charges.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser refused Mr Assange's bail application saying there were no conditions that would satisfy her that Mr Assange would not abscond. ""Mr Assange is not the only remand prisoner in Belmarsh and not the only one who is vulnerable,"" she said. ""The government has a responsibility to protect all prisoners.""Mr Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US and is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning over the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010.Spain to purchase medical supplies from ChinaDaniel Dombey in Madrid reportsSpain has announced it is buying €432m of medical equipment from China as it tries to contend with a surge in hospitalisations caused by the coronavirus, which has killed more than 700 people in the country in the last 24 hours.Salvador Illa, health minister, said the purchase included more than 550m masks, for both health professionals and patients, 5.5m tests and 950 respirators.In a sign of how prolonged Madrid expects the crisis to be, the masks will be delivered over eight weeks, while the respirators are due to be delivered between April and June. Spain has also asked a Nato coordination centre for help in procuring medical supplies such as personal protection equipment, respirators and test kits.Nato’s Euro-Atlantic Disaster Relief Coordination Centre acts as a clearing house for member state requests and can provide help on logistics. Miguel Villarroya, the chief of staff of Spain’s armed forces, said the request was made on Monday as part of Spain’s broader push for supplies. “When will it arrive?” he said of the material. “We don’t know. They will tell us.”Latest news from the UK prime minister's officeSebastian Payne in London• The government aims to carry out 25,000 tests a day within the next three weeks. “We are working flat out on trying to increase testing capacity. We have been making progress but there is more to do,” the spokesperson said. 6,491 people in the UK were tested for coronavirus yesterday, up from 5,605 on Monday.• The UK's current strategy rests on antibody tests, which could diagnose whether individuals have had the virus and are now immune. Number 10 said the NHS had ordered 3.5m such tests and Public Health England is working rapidly to ensure they are accurate. It hopes to have tests rolled out within days, not weeks.• 7.5m pieces of personal protective equipment have been shipped across the NHS in the last 24 hours.• The government pledged to crack down on black market profiteers.• Downing Street has been in contact with the London Taxi Drivers Association to explore whether black cab drivers can help deliver food and supplies to those in self-isolation.• The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to unveil his third economic package to help self-employed Britons tomorrow.WHO calls for vulnerable communities to be 'urgently' prioritisedThe World Health Organization has called on the international community to ""urgently prioritise"" people and communities already affected by crises in its response to the pandemic.""While Covid-19 is a threat to people everywhere, what’s most worrying is the danger the virus poses to people already affected by crisis,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said in a media conference.The WHO has launched an action plan to protect vulnerable communities, including ramping up surveillance and lab testing, and encouraging community-level physical distancing and the suspension of mass gatherings.""People and communities that are already uprooted due to conflict, displacement, the climate crisis or other disease outbreaks are the ones we must urgently prioritize""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) (@WHO) March 25, 2020""People and communities that are already uprooted due to conflict, displacement, the climate crisis or other disease outbreaks are the ones we must urgently prioritize""-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirusCanadian parliament to pass C$82bn emergency economic bill todayCanada’s House of Commons passed emergency legislation to unlock C$82bn in financial assistance for individuals and businesses after Justin Trudeau’s government dropped some controversial measures.Mr Trudeau’s proposal would have given his government unlimited scope to tax, spend and borrow until the end of 2021. The government agreed to drop the taxation power and shorten the term of other emergency powers to September, Canadian media reported. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer had said some of the original measures were “undemocratic”.The emergency economic package includes tax relief for businesses and financial support for workers, including a new unemployment benefit. Mr Trudeau said 500,000 people made jobless claims in Canada last week.Final approval of the bill is expected today.US at risk of 'breakout' of new cases unless stricter measures enforcedThe US is at risk of a significant ""breakout"" of cases, according to a new analysis released by Morgan Stanley, which monitors and compares the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak across a diverse range of countries.The fact that positive case numbers are doubling every three days in the US - the highest rate of the 10 countries Morgan Stanley is monitoring - ""is a concern"", according to the authors. As of the 24th of March, 37 per cent of people tested in New York were found to be positive.The analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote:We believe there are still a significant number of uncovered cases in the US. Although several states have issued 'stay at home', 'shelter in place', or 'non-essential workers at home' orders during the past few days, the US still lacks the aggressive containment measures in many regions with active transmissions.'To limit greater spread, the city would either need to aggressively expand its testing, to include individuals who are asymptomatic, or enforce stricter quarantine measures immediately, they said.In Italy, the authors said they were ""cautiously optimistic"" about the decline in new cases day by day. They also noted that ""most Asian geographies are now stable with South Korea representing the best case in terms of how to contain the viral spread"".Reggae star Bobi Wine releases video urging Ugandans not to spread virusDavid Pilling, Africa editor, reports:Bobi Wine, the Ugandan reggae and dancehall singer, has released a video urging everyone to wash their hands, report symptoms and take all precautions possible not to spread coronavirus.Mr Wine, who calls himself the “ghetto president” after the Kampala slum where he grew up, said he had decided to release a video on social media because he was banned from TV and radio broadcasts. Mr Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagalanyi, has been frequently detained for his opposition to the government of Yoweri Museveni, president since 1986.The singer, who has become a bete noire of Mr Musevieni, said Ugandans had been trying to follow health experts’ advice. “But it is not a very practical option in Uganda. Our people cannot stay home for a day because they live from hand to mouth. If they stay home they will not eat.”Mr Wine said it was a time to suspend political differences and “confront the virus as a human family”. Still, asked how well the government was doing in the fight against coronavirus, he said: “Museveni is talking very seriously. He’s not yet acting very seriously.” Uganda has so far confirmed 14 cases, but experts said this might reflect a lack of test kits.His musical message follows similar endeavours in Africa, including a song from South Africa’s Ndlovu Youth Choir, promoting hand washing and social distancing with Zulu-inspired dance moves.US imports of Chinese goods fall by almost half in a yearAime Williams in Washington:The volume of imports into the US from China collapsed by an “unprecedented” amount over the first two weeks of March, according to new data.New figures from Panjiva, a supply chain data company, show the number of Chinese goods arriving in the US was down by 44.9 per cent over the first half of March compared with the same period last year.The figures showed a decline of more than two thirds in the number of computers built in China and shipped to the US, with a similar drop in televisions and computer monitors.More broadly, US seaborne imports were 15 per cent lower in the first two weeks of March compared with the same period last year. This includes the slump in Chinese imports, and declining trade with Europe. Shipments from Germany were down a tenth, and those from France from 12.5 per cent.Dubai orders most private sector employees to work remotelySimeon Kerr in DubaiDubai has directed the private sector to implement home working for 80 per cent of employees from Thursday until April 9.Supermarkets, groceries and pharmacies are exempt from the edict, which comes as the United Arab Emirates reported a further escalation of coronavirus cases to 333. Most of the 85 new cases are aged between 20 and 44.The emirate earlier on Wednesday also ordered all commercial outlets to close, except for bakeries, car workshops, laundries, and technical and electrical services providers. Clinics and banks will continue to operate as normal.The tightening of work restrictions comes as some employees in jobs they regarded as unessential raised concerns they were still being asked to attend their workplace. Many businesses have already implemented remote work operations.The UAE is enforcing strict measures seeking to keep the public at home, only allowing people out to fetch essential supplies or attend work.UK chancellor leads call for banks to help businesses not covered by virus supportMatthew Vincent in LondonBritain's chancellor, financial regulator and Bank of England governor have sent a joint letter to UK banks telling them they must keep lending to support businesses -- even those not covered by recently launched Covid-19 support schemes.On Thursday, Rishi Sunak, along with interim Financial Conduct Authority chief Christopher Woolard and new Bank governor Andrew Bailey said lenders must “maintain and extend” their willingness to lend to the mid-sized companies that cannot benefit from the Covid Corporate Financing Facility and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.They stressed: “We must ensure that firms whose business models were viable before this crisis remain viable once it is over. This includes those firms not covered by CBILS or CCFF.”CCFF only applies to those companies large enough to issue commercial debt, while CBILS offers government-backed finance of up to only £5m for small companies.
Mr Sunak said the Bank of England and FCA would be monitoring the situation closely.British NHS staff overseas call on government support to return homeLaura Hughes in LondonNHS doctors and nurses working or travelling in Australia and New Zealand have called for assistance in order to return to the UK to serve on the frontlines in the battle against the virus.Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, announced on Tuesday that Singapore had agreed to act as a transit hub for those trying to leave New Zealand and Australia. However, UK health workers warned they had received little or no information from either the airlines or the government.Olivia Turner, a British nurse, said she had spent almost £5,000 on flights with no certainty if they would get her home.""I think the lack of information is the worst. I am so confused. I was able to book these flights even though the airlines may not be operating and say they have cancelled all international flights,"" she said.""Prices are also extortionate and it’s unclear if we can get refunds. People just can’t afford to carry on like this.""A number of NHS staff stuck in the country also say they cannot volunteer to help in local hospitals without the correct registration for Australia.""We can’t even help at the hospitals here. It’s extremely frustrating and it is a waste"", Ms Turner said. ""I want to be able to help as this is what I have trained for and I have a duty of care. I feel bad for my colleagues back home.""I don’t think the government should necessarily prioritise NHS workers, because everyone wants and needs to come home in equal measure. However, I think they need to consider that there are a large number of NHS staff over here who are stuck and will be of benefit back in the UK. It is therefore in their interests to get us home.Primark withholds quarterly rent payments on UK storesJonathan Eley, retail correspondent, reportsDiscount fashion chain Primark has withheld the quarterly rent payments due on Wednesday on the majority of its UK stores as it requests that landlords help it weather the coronavirus lockdown.John Bason, finance director of parent company Associated British Foods, said the company needed to ""align the rent payments with the extraordinary circumstances we have at the moment"".""By not paying today we have stressed the urgency of this,"" he added.The company has written to 110 landlords. Mr Bason would not be specific about what the company is asking for, but said that ""everything was on the table"".All of the company's 189 UK stores closed on Sunday. Stores in other large markets such as Spain, France and Germany had already shut. Worldwide, the lockdown is costing Primark £650m a month in lost sales.London City Airport to temporarily closePhilip Georgiadis and Nikou Asgari report:London City Airport is to close until the end of April as demand for air travel dries up and the UK begins a period of restricted movement.The airport, which was built on reclaimed docklands to the east of the City of London and is a favourite of business travellers, said it would suspend all commercial and private flights from Wednesday evening until the end of next month, although the situation will be kept under review.Anyone planning to travel from the airport should expect to be contacted by their airline.“At this point in this fast-moving and unprecedented situation, we think this is the responsible thing to do for the safety and wellbeing of our staff, passengers and everyone associated with the airport,” London City Airport said in a statement.The UK’s Foreign Office has advised against all international travel, and urged Britons abroad to travel home while they still can.The aviation industry has been at the sharp end of the economic disruption unleashed by coronavirus as nationwide lockdowns and flight bans have caused passenger numbers to plummet.Yesterday the chancellor sent a letter to airline and airport executives warning that ""bespoke support"" will only be offered once companies have explored all other financial options.London's police force 'determined' to keep the capital safeRobert Wright in LondonThe commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she was “determined” London’s police force would continue to keep the UK capital safe and provide a good quality service as the force worked through the second day of new coronavirus restrictions.Ms Dick said the force’s officers were talking to people on London’s streets and explaining the new guidance.“The vast majority of people are very positive and want to comply with the new guidance,” the commissioner said. “We all have our role to play in keeping our country safe, keeping everybody safe.”Boris Johnson, prime minister, announced new restrictions on people’s movements on Monday and said the police would be given powers to enforce them. On Tuesday, West Midlands Police said they had been forced to break up a barbecue with 20 guests. The Met has so far mostly taken a softly-softly approach.Ms Dick said the force would use enforcement only if it “absolutely” had to.But she added: “We won’t hesitate if there are people who are deliberately breaching the law.”UK police forces are beginning to suffer significant absences because of the virus. But they also face reduced workload in some areas because pubs and bars are closed and sporting events cancelled.Ms Dick said the Met was in a “good position” to respond to the challenges posed by coronavirus.IMF and World Bank call on G20 to offer debt relief to poor countriesDelphine Strauss in LondonThe IMF and World Bank have called on G20 countries to offer immediate debt relief to poor countries that urgently need to free up funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the Washington-based institutions called on all official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments at once, if asked for forbearance by countries that qualify for the World Bank’s concessional lending programme.“This will help with IDA [International Development Association] countries’ immediate liquidity needs to tackle challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak and allow time for an assessment of the crisis impact and financing needs for each country,” the statement said.The intention then would be for the IMF and World Bank to identify countries in need of debt relief and put forward a proposal for financial aid and debt relief at their annual spring meetings in April.Some New York City streets to be closed to trafficJoshua Chaffin in New YorkNew York City will close some streets to traffic in a further effort to promote social distancing and slow the spread of the Coronavirus.Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the new measures as he disclosed that the state's caseload had risen to 30,811 - by far the nation's highest. On Tuesday, Mr Cuomo likened the pandemic to a ""bullet train,"" saying that it was spreading faster than authorities had predicted and would hit the state sooner and with greater force than anticipated.The governor on Wednesday reiterated his call for the federal government to send thousands of additional ventilators to help New York cope, and promised the state would then forward them on to other regions after it has passed its peak of infections.""We're asking for the country to help us - we will return the favour,"" he said. Mr Cuomo agreed with President Trump that it was ""not sustainable"" to keep the economy closed indefinitely, but argued there was a more nuanced approach to be taken that would not simply pit public health against the economy.Palladium prices surge amid lockdown in South AfricaNeil Hume in LondonThe price of palladium surged again on Wednesday after the South African government said the 21-day lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus would apply to the mining industry with only limited exemptions.Gwede Mantashe, the country’s minister of mineral resources and energy, said mining operations would be scaled back significantly, particularly labour-intensive underground mines.On palladium and sister metal platinum, he said the processing of mined material would be allowed to continue so that smelters, which cannot be switched on and off abruptly, could remain operational.South Africa produces around three-quarters of the world platinum and almost 40 per cent of its palladium, metals mainly used to reduce harmful vehicle emissions.Palladium has been on a rollercoaster ride this year. The metal hit a record high above $2,800 a troy ounce in February before crashing below $1,600 last week as production of new cars around the world plummeted.It started to rally as South Africa cranked up its response to the deadly virus on Monday. The metal was up 16 per cent to $2,240 on Wednesday on Mr Mantashe’s comments, which have reawakened fears of a supply crunch.The miners that will be most affected by the lockdown include London-listed Anglo American.“Assuming that 50 per cent of operating costs of the impacted assets are paid through this lockdown (labour, contracts, etc) and 25 per cent of capex (essential maintenance) we would calculate that the 21-day stoppage would cost Anglo American $340m,” said Tyler Broda, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.He added: “Clearly [this is] unhelpful but the company has months of liquidity to see through this shutdown.”If Covid-19 is not beaten in Africa it will return to haunt us all | Free to readAbiy Ahmed, Ethiopian prime minister and 2019 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, writesThere is a major flaw in the strategy to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Advanced economies are unveiling unprecedented economic stimulus packages. African countries, by contrast, lack the wherewithal to make similarly meaningful interventions. Yet if the virus is not defeated in Africa, it will only bounce back to the rest of the world.That is why the current strategy of unco-ordinated country-specific measures, while understandable, is myopic, unsustainable and potentially counter-productive. A virus that ignores borders cannot be tackled successfully like this.Read the full op-ed here.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to keep everyone informed during this extraordinary crisis.

Senior JCB directors will not take a salary ""until further notice"".The company's nine manufacturing sites across the UK closed on March 18 due to both a shortage of parts and a collapse in demand.Graeme Macdonald, chief executive, said:These are certainly unprecedented times and none of us expected to find ourselves in this situation. In announcing that all those JCB colleagues asked not to work will receive 80% of their pay, we hope to remove any financial concerns that many people will undoubtedly have had.The privately-owned company said it will use the UK government's job retention scheme to help offset the cost of paying its employees.Spain’s deputy prime minister tests positive for Covid-19Daniel Dombey in MadridCarmen Calvo, Spain’s deputy prime minister, has tested positive for coronavirus and remains in hospital, Madrid said on Wednesday.Ms Calvo, prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s trusted number two, has been hospitalised for respiratory problems since Sunday but earlier tests had proved inconclusive.Mr Sánchez’s office said she was “developing favourably” and was in quarantine in the hospital. Two other cabinet ministers have previously also tested positive, as well as Mr Sánchez’s wife and other members of his family.S&P 500 rises 3% as investors await stimulus detailsUS stocks sought their first back-to-back gains since early February on Wednesday as investors awaited details on the $2tn stimulus deal agreed by US lawmakers.The S&P 500, which fluctuated between losses and gains for most of the morning, was up 3.3 per cent in early afternoon trade. Industrials and energy led the way with gains of more than 6 per cent, while consumer staples underperformed.Wall Street had its best day in more than a decade on Wednesday amid optimism on the deal, that is expected to provide economic relief to American taxpayers and businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The gains in US equities followed a rise in European and Asian stocks overnight. The Stoxx 600 ended the day 3.1 per cent higher, while the FTSE 100 climbed 3.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the Topix gained 6.9 per cent.Brussels calls for 'vigilance' to prevent foreign corporate takeoversJim Brunsden reportsBrussels will warn governments to be “particularly vigilant” to the risk of prized companies being snapped up in foreign takeovers during the coronavirus crisis, saying that the economic shock could leave Europe’s healthcare sector and other “strategic industries” vulnerable.In guidelines seen by the FT, and due to be published on Wednesday, the European Commission says that foreign direct investment should not be allowed to “have a harmful impact on the EU’s capacity to cover the health needs of its citizens.”“The commission urges member states to be particularly vigilant to avoid that the current health crisis does not result in a sell-off of Europe’s business and industrial actors, including SMEs,” the guidelines say. “Among the possible consequences of the current economic shock is an increased potential risk to strategic industries, in particular but by no means limited to healthcare-related industries.”The guidance will be discussed by EU leaders during their teleconference tomorrow. It echoes warnings from German economy minister Peter Altmaier that his country was “determined to protect our companies and jobs” from hedge funds and reflects the bloc’s anxiety that cutting edge firms will become vulnerable to takeovers during the hard times ahead.Berlin and Brussels already moved this month to repel a US attempt to lure biopharma group CureVac to shift its research across the Atlantic.Hoppings annual funfair cancelled in NewcastleChris Tighe in north-east EnglandEurope’s largest travelling fair, The Hoppings, an annual event which takes place on Newcastle’s Town Moor each June, has been cancelled.The decision not to hold the fair in 2020, announced on Wednesday, was taken jointly by Newcastle City Council and the Freemen of the City, the historic grouping that manages the Town Moor. It will next take place in 2021.Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes, said: “The Hoppings is an extremely popular event but in light of the pandemic and the government’s restrictions around social distancing it simply cannot go ahead.”The cancellation comes amid concerns that too many people are flocking to the Town Moor, a big expanse of green space near Newcastle city centre, for exercise, thereby breaching the government’s social distancing rule of staying two metres apart.Coronavirus ignites political rift among senior politicians in BrazilBryan Harris in São Paulo reportsThe coronavirus outbreak has sparked a fresh political feud in Brazil as a majority of the nation’s state governors move to chart a response that runs counter to the one adopted by President Jair Bolsonaro.On Tuesday night, Mr Bolsonaro inflamed opinion across the political spectrum when he described the deadly virus as a “little cold” that would not harm most people and urged governors to get citizens back to work and children back to school.The comments sparked an immediate response with 21 out of 27 governors on Wednesday agreeing to meet to discuss the country’s response to the crisis without Mr Bolsonaro or the federal government. Nine governors have said they will ignore the president’s advice and strategies for dealing with the outbreak.""We will not accept this from the president. This is not the position of a ruler. Ignorance is not a virtue,"" said Ronaldo Caiado, the governor of the central Goiás state, who was until recently a close ally of Mr Bolsonaro. ""Social isolation of all people, with the exception of those who exercise essential functions in life, will continue in Goiás.""For the seventh consecutive night, Brazilians on Tuesday protested outside their windows by banging pots and pans together, a demonstration known as a panelaço. Mr Bolsonaro’s response to the crisis is increasingly raising questions about his political future.Death toll rises in Italy as new infections slowMiles Johnson in Rome reportsA further 683 people have died from the Covid 19 virus in Italy over the past 24 hours even as the rate of growth of new infections continued to slow.Official numbers on Wednesday showed that Italy’s total number of diagnosed cases rose by 7.5 per cent to 74,386, the third consecutive day of daily growth under 10 per cent. The total number who have died in Italy from the virus now stands at 7,503 — the largest of any country in the world so far since the outbreak began.The latest numbers were released as the man who usually presents them to the nation, head of civil protection Angelo Borrelli, went into self-isolation on Wednesday along with his entire team after he exhibited symptoms of the Covid 19 virus.The total number of active cases, which excludes patients who have recovered or died, rose to 57,521 from 54,030, a daily increase of 6.4 per cent. The number of Italian patients who have recovered increased to 9,362 from 8,326 on Tuesday, while the number requiring intensive care treatment rose to 3,489 from 3,396 the day before.405,000 volunteer to help the UK health serviceRobert Shrimsley reportsIn just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the UK government’s call for volunteers to support the NHS and vulnerable citizens. That’s significantly more than the 250,000 initially sought. The figure was revealed at the prime minister’s daily press conference on Wednesday.Boris Johnson said:They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients. They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home and they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus. That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.Recession to end Portugal's multi-year run of solid growth, says ministerPeter Wise in LisbonPortugal’s finance minister said the country faced a recession this year despite being better prepared than ever before to tackle a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic.Mário Centeno was speaking hours after the former bailout country posted its first budget surplus in 46 years of democracy and reported a fourth consecutive year of growth above the eurozone average.“We are working on ways to return to normality, but we will always be talking about a scenario of recession this year,” Mr Centeno, who is also head of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told a news conference.Eliminating the budget deficit had given Portugal “a solid base” to deal with the unparalleled shock to the economy caused by the pandemic, he said. But he warned that the crisis could result in a budget deficit this year equivalent to “some percentage points” of gross domestic product.Statistics Portugal said earlier the country had posted a budget surplus of 0.2 per cent of GDP and economic growth of 2.2 per cent in 2019.Mr Centeno’s remarks came as Portugal reported a 27 per cent increase in confirmed coronavirus cases to 2,995 in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday. The number of deaths caused by the virus rose to 43, an increase of 10 fatalities over the same period.UK still short on virus tests for health workersRobert Shrimsley reportsChris Whitty, the chief medical officer, acknowledged that it was still not possible to test all NHS staff and key workers who are self-isolating for coronavirus, so that it was possible to get some back to work.“There is a global shortage but that is the next priority”, said Prof Whitty, speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing on Wednesday.Cuomo praises Trump as companies ramp up production of medical gearJoshua Chaffin in New YorkNew York governor Andrew Cuomo struck a conciliatory tone towards the White House on Wednesday, going so far as to praise the president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for their efforts.“The president and his team, I think, are using the [defence production act] well because it’s basically a leverage tool when you’re dealing with private companies, right?” Mr Cuomo said. ""We need your help, we can demand your help, or you could agree to help and we need you to step up and increase production.""On Tuesday, Mr Cuomo sounded exasperated when talking about the White House's reluctance to activate the defence production act to speed the delivery of medical supplies, particularly ventilators.Today, Mr Cuomo acknowledged that even if private companies were enlisted in the effort it would still take time for them to “put together the supply chain, put together the workforce and get these things up and running"".He suggested the state was working well with the White House on what was “an extraordinarily difficult task"", saying: “I want to thank the president for his co-operation, and his team, for their co-operation.”Deputy British ambassador to Hungary dies from Covid-19Laura Hughes in London reports:Steven Dick, the UK's deputy ambassador to Hungary, has died aged 37 after contracting coronavirus.Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said: ""I am desperately saddened by the news of Steven's death and my heart goes out to his parents Steven and Carol.""Steven was a dedicated diplomat and represented his country with great skill and passion. He will be missed by all those who knew him and worked with him.Moscow moves closer to full quarantineMax Seddon in MoscowMoscow is to introduce significant restrictions on public activity next week after President Vladimir Putin ordered a one-week holiday to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, said the capital would close public spaces including restaurants, shopping malls and parks during the holiday, which is to last until April 3.""Lots of people are going to want to come to Moscow then to go for a stroll. But there won't be anything to do in Moscow. Better to stay at home,"" Mr Sobyanin said on a local TV station on Wednesday. Additional restrictions would be announced later this week, he added.Mr Putin has moved to tackle the pandemic with greater urgency after Mr Sobyanin warned him that Russia likely has vastly more cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, than official data suggest. Cases jumped to 658 on Wednesday, far lower than in European countries, with just three deaths.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Putin made a special address to the nation in which he postponed the date of a nationwide vote that was set potentially to extend his rule by 12 years, but stopped well short of announcing the full lockdowns or mass testing implemented in many other countries.France records another 231 coronavirus deathsVictor Mallet in ParisA further 231 people died from the coronavirus pandemic in French hospitals in the past 24 hours, similar to the death toll of 240 reported on Tuesday, said Jérôme Salomon, director-general of health.The number of those hospitalised and in intensive care continued to rise, however, and French officials have acknowledged that coronavirus deaths at home and in old people’s homes are not being announced in the daily government bulletins. So far 1,331 people have died in hospital from the virus.“In France we have an epidemic that is nationwide and worsening rapidly,” Mr Salomon said. “The crisis will be long and the coming days will be difficult.”France has boosted the number of its intensive care beds to 8,000 from 5,000 and continues to move patients from eastern France, where hospitals are close to being overwhelmed, to less affected areas. But health officials said the Paris area was within three days of being saturated by seriously ill patients with the virus.Coronavirus stringency index: A look at government responses to Covid-19Alan Smith in LondonA new daily index of measures taken by national governments in response to coronavirus reveals the global impact of the pandemic.Produced by the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, the index calculates the overall stringency of government responses on a range of measures including restrictions on movement, school and workplace closures, mass gatherings, economic measures and investments in healthcare.The FT has produced an animation of daily changes in the index, revealing how the pandemic has rapidly affected daily life across the world since the first lockdown began in Wuhan on January 23.US air passenger traffic at 10% of normal levelPassenger traffic in US airports has slipped to 10 per cent of its normal levels, according to data from the Transportation Security Administration.The TSA, which tallies the number of passengers who begin their trips from US airports, normally processes more than 2m people per day in March. Yesterday, only 279,018 people travelled by air.Deutsche Bank’s Torsten Slok, chief economist, and Doug Runte, head of transportation debt research, provided the chart below to illustrate the sharp decline in US air passenger traffic this month:On Wednesday, United Airlines said it would reduce its domestic schedule by 52 per cent, from a previous 42 per cent, due to a continued decline in travel demand from the coronavirus outbreak.France closes Orly airport in ParisDavid Keohane in ParisFrance’s Orly airport to the south of Paris will close at the end of month due to the impact of the coronavirus, while the larger Roissy-Charles De Gaulle to the north of the capital is having its capacity significantly reduced.Orly will be closed from March 31 until further notice, French airport group ADP confirmed on Wednesday.Passenger traffic at Orly on Tuesday was down 92 per cent compared to what would have been expected before the virus hit.Flights that would have landed at Orly will be routed to CDG, which has already closed one terminal and will close another by the end of the month.On Tuesday traffic at CDG was down 82 per cent compared to a normal day, with ADP predicting that residual traffic will hit about 10 to 15 per cent in the coming weeks.Earlier this week, airports in Europe are lobbying to be added to any bailout of airlines, forecasting they will suffer a €14bn decline in revenue this year because of the rapid spread of coronavirus and the subsequent international travel restrictions.French companies to receive €4bn of government aid to help laid-off workersVictor Mallet in ParisNearly 100,000 French companies will receive €4bn of government support for 1.2m employees temporarily laid off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdown, the labour ministry said.The government has announced a €45bn economic rescue package to deal with the crisis, including up to €8.5bn for the jobless compensation scheme - known in France as “partial unemployment” - over two months.The strategy, adopted by several European governments, is to ensure that jobs and skills are maintained and companies survive so the economy can recover quickly once the crisis is over.France says its system is “the most protective in Europe"". Muriel Pénicaud, labour minister, said in a statement: “We will avoid bankruptcies and redundancies.”US stocks advance on hopes for stimulus dealThe S&P 500 moved higher for a second straight day but US stocks trimmed their gains after a $2tn economic stimulus bill appeared to hit a snag in Congress.The benchmark S&P 500, which jumped more than 5 per cent at its high mark for the day, closed up 1.2 per cent to lock in its first stretch of back-to-back rallies in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite failed to hold on to its earlier gains, dropping 0.5 per cent.Stocks pulled back after a group of Republican senators raised objections to one provision of the stimulus plan, while Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders threatened to hold up the bill unless those objections were dropped.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 0.854 per cent. The dollar index fell 1.2 per cent.Group of US banks commit to mortgage freeze for California residentsPatrick McGee in San FranciscoFour of the five largest banks in the US have committed to a 90-day mortgage freeze for anyone in California affected by Covid-19, Governor Gavin Newsom announced.The participating banks are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and US Bank. The outlier is Bank of America, which only agreed to a 30 days “forbearance.”California does not have regulatory oversight of the banks, but they agreed to the measure and that non-payments will not adversely affect credit scores.The mortgage-freeze announcement, broadcast live on Twitter and Facebook, caused an immediate backlash in the live comments sections, with plenty of listeners complaining the policy doesn’t extend to rent payments, but only mortgages.California, which on its own ranks as the fifth-largest economy in the world, has been hit hard by coronavirus, with more than 1m people filing for unemployment benefits since March 13, the governor said.Walmart granting rent relief to 10,000 businessesAlistair Gray in New YorkWalmart is granting rent relief to about 10,000 businesses that operate on its premises in the US as concerns grow over how smaller enterprises can cope with the coronavirus shutdown.The world’s biggest retailer said it was offering to waive April payments for the hairdressers, restaurant franchises, community banks and other outlets that lease space in its stores.Landlords across the US are facing calls to give a break to tenants whose revenues have dried up due to fears about Covid-19 and restrictions imposed to reduce its spread. Walmart’s grocery business is expected to be among the winners from the crisis as customers stock up on supplies.Mario Draghi: We face a war against coronavirus and must mobilise accordinglyThe coronavirus pandemic is a human tragedy of potentially biblical proportions. Many today are living in fear of their lives or mourning their loved ones. The actions being taken by governments to prevent our health systems from being overwhelmed are brave and necessary. They must be supported. But those actions also come with a huge and unavoidable economic cost. While many face a loss of life, a great many more face a loss of livelihood. Day by day, the economic news is worsening. Companies face a loss of income across the whole economy. A great many are already downsizing and laying off workers. A deep recession is inevitable.

The NHS has access to 8,175 but ministers have said 30,000 are needed in total. Ministers have already backed increased production of two existing machines that are made domestically.Dyson's CoVent model was developed in partnership with The Technology Partnership, a medical devices company based in Cambridge.The brand known for its vacuum cleaners, hair dyers and air purifiers is looking to manufacture the ventilators at its Hullavington research centre in Wiltshire, located on the site of a former Royal Air Force base.Defence department asked to help repatriate US citizensKatrina Manson in WashingtonUS diplomats are turning to the department of defence to get thousands of citizens home as international travel shuts down in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus.US State department said it plans to fly 9,000 people home in 66 flights in coming days, but says it assesses 50,000 might seek to return to the US. It has already brought 9,000 people back from 28 countries.State department officials said on Wednesday their capacity is “strained” and the department has asked the Pentagon for help with the complex process of contracting civil aviation planes to bring Americans overseas.UK High Court rejects challenge to release immigration detaineesJane Croft in LondonThe High Court has dismissed a legal challenge which had sought the temporary release of detainees in immigration removal centres if they were at risk from coronavirus.Two judges dismissed a judicial review challenge brought by Detention Action, a charity, against the Home Office on Wednesday evening. The judges ruled that actions taken by Priti Patel, home secretary, to manage the risk of Covid-19 in the UK's nine detention centres were ""sufficient to manage the risk"" in the vast majority of cases.Detention Action had brought the court case over the lawfulness of continued detention for those with underlying health conditions amid concerns about the risks of Covid-19 for those held in the UK's nine centres. Currently one individual has tested positive for Covid-19 in Yarl's Wood centre but there are concerns that the pandemic could spread more widely.Earlier on Wednesday, the High Court heard that the Home Office was already reviewing the cases of detainees and future actions could include the option of transferring the most vulnerable to hospital. Some individuals have already been released and numbers of those held in immigration detention centres have fallen from around 1,500 people in December 2019 to around 736 people now, the court heard.Dame Victoria Sharp, president of the Queen's Bench Division, dismissed the legal challenge and said the secretary of state was taking ""sensible and prudent steps to address the effect of Covid-19 in immigration detention centres"" and added that the Home Office should be allowed to complete its ongoing review.Ireland's death toll edges up to nineArthur Beesley in DublinDublin reported two new Covid-19 deaths on a day when the number of new coronavirus infections rose to a daily high of 235, bringing the number cases to 1,564.The latest fatalities, disclosed on Wednesday night, have taken to nine the number of people who have died of the disease in the Irish republic. Officials said 39 patients were in intensive as of Monday and 24 per cent of all cases at that time were associated with healthcare workers.Two new deaths in Northern Ireland brought the total there to seven, meaning coronavirus has now claimed 16 lives on the island of Ireland. The Northern Ireland authorities reported 37 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 209.Finland to cut off region around Helsinki to slow Covid-19 spreadRichard Milne in OsloFinland is cutting off the region around its capital city Helsinki from the rest of the Nordic country in an attempt to slow the pace of the coronavirus outbreak.Sanna Marin, Finland's centre-left prime minister, announced on Thursday evening that travel into and out from the Uusimaa region that includes Helsinki would be prohibited until April 19, with only a few exceptions.“The only workable way to slow the spread of the epidemic is to limit contacts between people,"" she said.Helsinki has been the epicentre of Finland's coronavirus outbreak and authorities are now trying to slow the spread to other regions of the long but sparsely populated country.Finland, which currently has about 880 confirmed cases and three deaths from coronavirus, has closed its borders and most schools.American Airlines draws down $1bn loanClaire Bushey in ChicagoAmerican Airlines has drawn down the $1bn loan it took out a week ago.American, like other airlines, has sought liquidity as demand for air travel evaporated amid the pandemic and the travel restrictions attempting to curb it. Delta Air Lines has drawn $3bn in loans, and Southwest Airlines has tapped $2bn.American is the most heavily indebted of the large US carriers. It carries debt of $25.6bn, double Delta or United.Lawmakers today unveiled a $2tn stimulus bill that includes $25bn in loans for passenger airlines and $4bn for cargo air carriers.Mnuchin optimistic that Senators will approve $2tn economic stimulus planJames Politi in WashingtonSteven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said he expected the $2tn economic stimulus package to pass the Senate later on Wednesday despite last minute opposition from a group of Republican lawmakers to a provision expanding unemployment benefits.""Our expectation is this bill passes tonight and gets to the House tomorrow and it passes. We need to get this money into the American economy and American workers,"" Mr Mnuchin said at a White House briefing.A group of Republican senators led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had earlier cast doubt on the passage of the legislation by objecting to a $600 per week increase in unemployment benefits that was part of the deal, on the grounds that it would provide a disincentive to work.But Mr Mnuchin, who said he spoke to some of the unhappy lawmakers, said he disagreed with their position, saying it did not create ""disincentives"" since most Americans wanted to keep their jobs. He also said that the idea of a $600 increase per week across the country was motivated by the need to get the money to recipients as fast as possible, and a more tailored approach would have taken longer since it would have to be delivered through each state."
1;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-03-24T22:48:32Z;Nike chief predicts worst of virus crisis over in ‘near future’;Donahoe says reopening of stores in China shows possible path for activity in rest of world;Europe and the US will be over the worst of the coronavirus crisis “in the near future”, Nike’s chief executive John Donahoe has predicted after the sportswear company said it had reopened most of its stores in China.The footwear and clothing group, which shut three-quarters of its outlets in greater China at the peak of the country’s coronavirus crisis in February, on Tuesday disclosed that about four out of five of its 7,000 stores in the region were now open.Nike’s update, which sent its shares up 8.5 per cent in after-hours trading, offers at least some hope that other economies brought to a standstill by the pandemic will be able to get back on their feet in coming months.The company has closed all its owned stores in several other countries, including in the US, Canada and western Europe, as authorities around the world impose restrictions on discretionary retail to control the outbreak.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Mr Donahoe, who took charge of Nike this year, said in a call with Wall Street analysts that he expected a “challenging period for those living in the US and Europe”. However, he added: “Our experience in China, Japan, and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future.”He cautioned, however, the company expected the virus to develop “on different timelines” in different countries, in part because of varying measures being taken to deal with the outbreak.Revenues from greater China dipped just 4 per cent in the three months to the end of February, its fiscal third quarter, although the decline would have been steeper without ecommerce and digital. Users of Nike’s exercise apps in China jumped 80 per cent in the period.Andrew Campion, chief financial officer, added that he expected revenues from Nike’s greater China division to be “roughly flat” in the fourth quarter now under way, compared with the same period a year ago.Nike began reopening stores in China about a month ago, and reopened its first in Wuhan, the city that was the centre of the outbreak, last week. Global revenues for the company’s fiscal third quarter rose 5 per cent across the group to $10.1bn. Net income fell from $1.1bn to $847m due in part to a non-cash charge arising from a change to distribution in South America.The after-hours rally in Nike shares followed a 15 per cent jump in the New York trading day. They are still down 23 per cent for the year.

He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.“Today a unanimous jury found Michael Avenatti guilty of misusing his client’s information in an effort to extort tens of millions of dollars from the athletic apparel company Nike,” Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement. “While the defendant may have tried to hide behind legal terms and a suit and tie, the jury clearly saw the defendant’s scheme for what it was – an old fashioned shakedown.”Prosecutors accused Mr Avenatti last year of hatching the multimillion-dollar extortion plot against the Nike, saying he had threatened to release damaging information about payments the sportswear company allegedly made to high school basketball players. He was arrested in March just minutes after tweeting that he had scheduled a press conference.Mr Avenatti had previously represented Ms Daniels in two lawsuits against Mr Trump, with whom she claimed to have had an extramarital affair. Ms Daniels has since broken ties with Mr Avenatti.He briefly flirted with a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, before becoming embroiled in legal troubles.A federal grand jury in California has indicted Mr Avenatti on three dozen criminal charges related to allegations that he stole millions of dollars from clients. In New York, he faces charges of wire fraud and identity theft in a case related to an accusation that he stole $300,000 from Ms Daniels. He has pled not guilty in both cases.
3;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-01-17T19:20:10Z;Let athletes enjoy their high-tech footwear;All runners ultimately gain from the innovation of Nike and its rivals;Of the hundreds of thousands of part-time athletes lining up for a park run this weekend, at least some will sport the latest Nike Vaporfly shoes. Fellow runners will regard them with a mixture of envy, disdain — “they look ridiculous” was one Financial Times athlete’s verdict on the fluorescent, chunky-heeled footwear — and, increasingly, suspicion.The top-of-the-range ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, which retails for £240, is living up to Nike’s billing as “the fastest shoe we’ve ever made”. Last October, Vaporfly-wearing Brigid Kosgei of Kenya broke the longstanding women’s marathon record. A day earlier, her compatriot Eliud Kipchoge had run an unprecedented sub-two-hour marathon, kitted out with a Nike prototype shoe called AlphaFly. More compelling still for part-timers, a New York Times analysis last month showed runners in the most popular publicly available Vaporflys ran 4 to 5 per cent faster than those in an average shoe.World Athletics, the international governing body, is in the coming weeks due to consider changes to its rules on competition footwear. They currently stipulate that shoes cannot give athletes “any unfair assistance or advantage [and] must be reasonably available to all”. The mere rumour of a possible ban on the Nikes gave shares in rival Asics a second wind last week. But, in the long run, outlawing the shoes would be neither effective, nor fair.For purists, running is different from other sports. Under the right conditions, runners can compete at the highest level with no shoes at all. Over time, though, the quest for safety, comfort and competitive edge has turned into a race to improve footwear. Tailoring his athletes’ shoes in the 1960s to make them lighter and faster, Bill Bowerman, the legendary US track coach, “was willing to try anything” from kangaroo skin to cod, Phil Knight wrote in his book Shoe Dog. The two men went on to found Nike.The widening availability of fitness trackers and data analytics has encouraged Olympic-style competitiveness even among plodding part-time athletes. New shoes are costly, but many runners are well-heeled enough to pay to be as well-heeled as idols such as Ms Kosgei and Mr Kipchoge.In this environment, the 2017 launch of the Vaporfly, which boasts a thick foam midsole and a carbon fibre plate that provides “a propulsive sensation”, has helped give Nike a commanding lead. But then that is how markets work, as Asics’ chief executive acknowledged last year when he told the FT the group had failed to respond rapidly enough to the trend for US runners to take on 5km and 10km runs.The overseers of elite swimming, the purists’ other favourite sport, did change the rules on swimsuits 10 years ago after a spate of records fell to athletes in full-length bodysuits. That technology, though, was also adding to swimmers’ buoyancy.Nike shoes are in the medals for now only because rival innovators have yet to catch up. It is also easier to narrow the gap in shoe-tech than in the highly technical arena of, say, Formula 1 motor racing, where three manufacturers dominate. When Rhonex Kipruto broke the 10km road record last weekend, he did so in Adidas shoes.World Athletics should probe novel footwear for evidence of “unfair assistance”. But the watchdog would be better advised to concentrate on curbing illegal performance enhancement, from doping to bullying.Let the shoe-scientists run their parallel race. They may be out to sell more units, but they are also helping leading athletes — and park-running laggards — maximise their human capabilities.
4;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-01-16T10:03:56Z;Asics springs forward on reports of ban on Nike running shoes;World Athletics to consider new rules that could disqualify Vaporfly Next% from top competitions;Asics shares had a spring in their step on Thursday after reports that a key running shoe by rival Nike faced a ban for giving athletes an unfair advantage.Nike’s Vaporfly Next% long-distance shoes — described by the company as “the fastest shoe we’ve ever made” — face being blacklisted by World Athletics when it announces new rules on running shoes, according to a report by Runner’s World.Fuelled by rising debate over the role of technology advances in running shoes, athletics’ international governing body is set next month to consider new rules on the footwear that should be allowed in elite competition.Speculation has mounted that the rule change will prevent the use in elite competition of the Vaporfly Next% model, whose thick midsoles hold carbon fibre plates that act like springs to propel athletes forward. Any ban on the shoe — worn by Kenya’s Brigid Kosgei when she set the women’s marathon record last year — would come as a boon to Nike’s competitors, including Japan’s Asics.Asics shares rose as much as 7 per cent in Tokyo trading on Thursday — which would have been their biggest gain since August — before dropping back to close up 3 per cent.“We have not confirmed the accuracy of the report but, if true, we think this would be positive news for Asics as such a ban on a competitor’s shoes would make it easier for the company to regain market share in products for top runners,” said Kosuke Narikiyo, an analyst at Nomura.World Athletics’ governing council is due to receive a recommendation from a regulatory review group on the subject by the end of this month, which will be voted on when the council meets in five weeks’ time.World Athletics said the working group — made up of technical officials, athletes, health and science practitioners and legal experts — was “reviewing the shoe, the technology and the wording around the rule”.“We hope to make their findings available early in the new year,” it added.Nike did not respond to a request for comment.Should the Vaporfly Next% be deemed illegal, it would provide some relief for Asics and fellow Japanese shoemaker Mizuno, which have come under growing pressure from the US sportswear giant. Shares in the two Japanese groups were knocked this month on reports that competitors at the country’s prestigious Hakone Ekiden collegiate running event were increasingly opting for Nike shoes.Asics has lost ground to Nike after it misjudged fitness trends in the US that have pushed customers towards 5km and 10km runs and a softer sole than it had been producing. Motoi Oyama, chief executive of Asics, told the Financial Times last year that his company had failed to respond quickly enough to the shifting demand pattern and said redressing it would be critical to the company’s future.Should a ban affect Nike’s shoes, the blow could not come at a better time for Asics as the Kobe-based company prepares to make the most of its expensive sponsorship of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.In common with 14 other Japanese companies, including Nomura, Canon and Mizuho, Asics was persuaded to pay an estimated $100m for gold sponsorship of the games — a figure that contributed to these Olympics breaking a record for the most heavily sponsored sporting event in history.About $3.1bn was raised from Japanese companies alone, which chief executives told the FT had come after pressure from the advertising group Dentsu to support the games out of patriotic duty.
5;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-12-19T23:43:02Z;Nike results show growing importance of China;Sales rise of 10% comes as Mark Parker prepares to end tenure as chief executive;Nike’s chief executive Mark Parker will bow out on what he described as “a position of strength” after the latest results showed that controversies during his 13-year tenure had done little to hold back the US sportswear company’s financial performance.Mr Parker, who is passing the reins to technology industry executive John Donahoe next month, said the business and brand were “as strong as they’ve ever been” after quarterly revenues jumped at each of Nike’s four geographical divisions, led by China.Among a series of political criticisms drawn by the company in recent months, Nike was singled out by Mike Pence, the US vice-president, over its approach to doing business in China.He accused Nike of “checking its social conscience at the door” by pulling Houston Rockets merchandise from Chinese stores after one of the NBA team’s executives voiced support for protesters in Hong Kong.Nike has also had to deal with the fallout from a recent doping scandal in athletics. The company in October shut its Oregon Project athletics training programme after Alberto Salazar, a Nike-backed athletics coach, and Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with athletes from the project, received four-year bans for doping violations.None of these issues appeared to do much to hurt Nike’s results in its second quarter. Net income in the three months to the end of November jumped almost a third from a year ago to $1.12bn.Even though diluted earnings per share of 70 cents were better than analysts had forecast, the update failed to dazzle investors. Shares ticked down about 2 per cent in after-hours trading to just under $100 each, having already rallied 36 per cent this year to a record.Speaking to analysts on Thursday, Andrew Campion, chief financial officer, cautioned that he expected the company’s gross profit margins to be flat year-on-year in the third quarter due in part to the imposition of trade tariffs.He said “geopolitical trade dynamics” created “quarterly anomalies” but added that “one quarter, or one data point, does not equate to a trend”.“Over the past two-years, our gross margin expansion has significantly exceeded our goals,” he said.The results on Thursday underlined the growing importance to Nike of demand from China, where revenues leapt a fifth to $1.85bn. Sales from Nike’s domestic market of North America rose 5 per cent to $3.98bn.Higher sales from each of its footwear, apparel and equipment businesses helped revenues across the group rise a tenth to $10.3bn.The figures come at a pivotal time for Nike. Mr Donahoe, a former Ebay chief who already sits on its board, is preparing to become the company’s fourth chief executive in its 55-year history.Mr Parker, who will step up to executive chairman, highlighted his successor's experience in ecommerce, adding he would “help elevate Nike to the next level, and accelerate our strategic transformation”.“The best time to make change is from a position of strength and our brand and our business are as strong as they’ve ever been,” Mr Parker added.
6;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-12-11T05:00:28Z;Peloton’s sexist Christmas advert has another problem;Misjudged commercial is an example of an especially troublesome type of marketing mistake;"When an advertisement in which a young mother downs a gin cocktail in one long swallow gets a friendlier reception than one in which she exercises on a stationary bicycle at home, something has gone wrong. Peloton, the US fitness equipment company behind the latter, knows this to its cost.Peloton’s ad has provoked a cascade of criticism for being old-fashioned and sexist. It showed an affluent woman looking mildly terrified at her husband’s gift of a $2,245 exercise machine, but turning winsomely grateful the following Christmas after a year of intense exercise. It evoked a postwar era of advertising that portrayed wives as submissive rather than independent.Peloton’s effort was quickly satirised by Aviation Gin in its ad featuring the same actor drinking with friends, perhaps having escaped her husband for the night. Events move rather fast in marketing now: one company’s error is turned into another’s marketing meme before the media hubbub subsides.The reassuring news for Peloton, apart from the adage that all publicity is good publicity, is that errors tend to fade. Its share price fell last week, cutting more than $1bn from its market value, but has rebounded. It may take comfort from the Nike ad last year featuring the rebellious quarterback Colin Kaepernick, which briefly dented its shares but reinforced its brand.Peloton’s problem is that its holiday season ad falls into an unusual and especially troublesome type of marketing mistake — one that draws attention to a weakness in the product. This was not simply a case of a misjudged commercial; it told a story that Peloton should not have wanted to be told.The struggle to grab attention in a world of fragmenting media means that brands cannot play as safe as they did before. That is why campaigns that push boundaries and are initially seen as mistakes can later turn out to be nicely judged. Nike’s “Believe in something” ad featuring Kaepernick was a talking point and ended up being regarded as brave rather than offensive.Brands, and agencies representing them, that know exactly what they stand for and how marketing works are often rewarded for being intentionally provocative. Benetton’s “Unhate” campaign in 2011, which showed world leaders kissing, provoked anger in some countries but later won awards: “You can like it, you can dislike it, you can’t ignore it,” one judge said.But the stakes are high when product advertising is combined with social commentary: it can easily backfire. This happened with Pepsi’s 2017 ad, which implausibly portrayed the television star Kendall Jenner calming down a protest by handing a police officer a can of Pepsi. It was a problem with a Super Bowl ad for Dodge Ram trucks with the tagline “Built to Serve”, which featured a sermon by Martin Luther King.Ads can easily provoke a backlash by mistake. The examples include Dove’s Facebook ad for body lotion in 2017, which showed a black woman turning white as she changed her T-shirt, and a similarly insensitive “White is Purity” ad for Nivea deodorant. As with Peloton’s campaign, which ran for some time before attracting viral derision on Twitter, social media make such blunders uncomfortably visible.On the face of it, Peloton’s ad was this sort of error, although it was unintentionally sexist, rather than racist. As the heroine sits on a sofa with her husband at the end, she thanks him deeply, exclaiming, “a year ago, I didn’t realise how much this would change me”. Not only did her husband know better, it seems, but he was right to push her into becoming more toned.It recalls Betty Friedan’s 1963 critique in The Feminine Mystique of the “happy housewife” portrait of women in the media. “Why have so many American wives suffered this nameless, aching dissatisfaction?” she asked, despite their having “an up-and-coming husband and a station wagon full of children”. The answer was their passive dependence on their partners.On close examination, the Peloton ad does not portray a Friedan-like existence. The woman is a working mother, coming home in smart clothes to fit in exercise; the couple lead an impeccably upper-middle-class life, with abstract art and mid-century wishbone chairs. She is in a hurry but is not “young and frivolous, almost childlike”, as Friedan described the 1960s archetype.From Peloton’s perspective, the underlying error is that she seems isolated and its product is not helping. “She just said my name!” she exclaims after the on-screen Peloton instructor calls out to “Grace in Boston”. Grace might well be surprised, given that an average of 6,400 Peloton members join each of its cycling classes, streamed from its New York and London studios.Peloton’s pitch for its initial public offering in September was that “consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are seeking meaningful community connections”. Its customers meet remotely instead of rushing to classes such as SoulCycle to work out with others, while raising a family and holding down a job in the two-thirds of US households with dual incomes.The ad tells a different story. The IPO prospectus noted that “busy lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving demand for convenient fitness options”. But, while having a bicycle in the living room is handy, it does not help Grace find new friends. She comes to love the Peloton in her expensive home, but it may end up being as big a problem as her husband.john.gapper@ft.comFollow John Gapper with myFT and on Twitter"
7;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-25T12:57:28Z;John Donahoe, the tech chief aiming to revamp Nike;The former eBay chief arrives as the sportswear group finds itself in the line of fire;Soon after John Donahoe became chief executive of eBay in 2008, he came across a doctored clip online that depicted him as a Nazi. Users were so incensed by changes he had made to the auction site’s fees and listings system that they launched an internet hate campaign against him. The video shook the father of four, and that night he lay awake wondering what to do. By morning, he had decided to stay. “It’s in the periods of adversity that you can get the most done,” he later recalled. “Crisis is an opportunity.”Financially, there is no crisis at Nike, which this week appointed Mr Donahoe to replace Mark Parker as chief executive of the world’s largest sportswear business. The company behind Air Max trainers, Jordan basketball shoes and Tiger Woods golf gear has gone from strength to strength, with its market capitalisation of $143bn putting it in the top 50 of US companies.As Nike’s fourth chief executive in its five-decade history, Mr Donohoe may again need to draw on what Kent Thiry, who was his first boss at Bain, the management consultancy, describes as a “deep reservoir” of inner strength. Nike, which employs about 77,000 people, has recently found itself squarely in the political crosshairs and even for a company that is no stranger to controversy, some of the criticism has been intense.This week Mike Pence, the US vice-president, called out Nike’s approach to doing business in China — specifically its response when a Houston Rockets executive tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong. Mr Pence accused the company of “checking its social conscience at the door” for pulling the NBA basketball team’s merchandise from Chinese stores in an apparent effort to placate its most important overseas market.Nike this month also shut down the Oregon Project, an elite distance running programme known for training athletes including British Olympian Mo Farah, after its head coach Alberto Salazar received a four-year ban from the sport for breaching doping rules.Mr Donahoe, who has sat on Nike’s board since 2014, is undaunted. “I deeply resonate with Nike’s purpose,” the 6ft 5in former college basketball player said. “And I love sports.”Born just north of Chicago, where his father worked as an accountant, Mr Donahoe studied economics at Dartmouth before joining Bain. At the age of 24 he married Eileen, with whom he went on to have one daughter and three sons. The first was born while he was doing an MBA at Stanford.Joel Peterson, the JetBlue Airways chairman who has taught at Stanford for 27 years, says Mr Donahoe is known there as a “legend” for his unusually high grades. Yet Mr Donahoe recalls leaving the business school “incredibly stressed”. Meditation, and a therapist, helped him come to terms with what he told students in 2016 was his “massive fear of failure”. “All this stuff that some people think is kind of ‘fuzzy’ — I don’t. I view it as the only way you can actually perform at the highest level.”Fond of long walks with his wife, Mr Donohoe is regarded as a good listener gifted with easy charm. Dan Schulman recalls that Mr Donohoe flew cross-country to New York to recruit him from American Express to run PayPal, then part of eBay. That effort “made an impression on me”, he says, adding that the 59-year-old establishes “personal connections very quickly”.Yet Mr Donahoe navigated Bain, known for its hard-nosed “up or out” approach to promotions, to become its chief executive in 1999 at just 39 years old. Six years later, Meg Whitman, another of the firm’s alumni, lured him to eBay to run its ecommerce division.He took over as chief executive as eBay was grappling with its 2005 purchase of Skype, a botched move into China and a broader slowdown. “That was a very challenging time, but he was able to weather the storm,” recalls Mr Thiry. The eBay chief went on to oversee a push into mobile and rapid expansion both in ecommerce and PayPal.Devin Wenig, who worked for him at eBay and succeeded him as chief executive, recalls a moment in 2014 when the pair were holed up in a tiny windowless room wondering what to do about an enormous data breach. Mr Wenig suggested requiring millions of customers to change their passwords — a move seen as radical at the time that risked “screwing the business up” but was necessary to ensure data security. Mr Donahoe came round to the idea. “A lot of people would have taken the easy way out,” says Mr Wenig.As CEO, Mr Donahoe initially batted away calls from the activist investor Carl Icahn to sell PayPal and waged a “better together” campaign to keep the group intact. He eventually acceded to the split and stepped down. In 2017 he took charge of ServiceNow, a cloud computing company.Investors expect Mr Donahoe to lead a digital transformation of Nike, which will pay him up to $18.5m a year in cash and stock. “John is excellent at thinking about the next chapter,” says Mr Schulman, who now heads PayPal.When Mr Donohoe takes up his post in January, critics will find him well prepared for a fight. Mr Donahoe, who rises at 5.30am and hits the gym before work, once likened leadership at the highest levels of business to competing in a World Cup final. “There are people getting dirt on their shins, shit on their uniforms, there’s injuries. It’s a battle . . . Making one mistake, or capitalising on one opportunity, is the difference between winning and losing.”The writer is the FT’s US consumer correspondent
8;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
9;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-25T11:07:26Z;Liverpool wins High Court kit battle with New Balance;Ruling will allow European Champions to sign £70m-a-year shirt deal with Nike;Liverpool football club has won a legal battle against sportswear maker New Balance, which had sought to stop the English Premier League side from signing a lucrative £70m-a-year shirt deal with Nike.Boston-headquartered New Balance are the current kit suppliers to Liverpool, last season’s victors in the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious club competition, and the current Premier League leaders.The US sportswear company launched legal proceedings against the English team earlier this month in an attempt to enforce a “matching clause” in its current deal which runs until 2020. The clause was designed to allow the company to equal Nike’s offer in order to renew its contract.On Friday, the case was dismissed by the High Court, which ruled that Liverpool is not obliged to take up New Balance’s counter offer.In his judgment, Mr Justice Teare pointed to Nike’s plan to use its endorsement deals with superstars, such as basketball player LeBron James, tennis champion Serena Williams and music artist Drake, to also promote Liverpool kits worldwide.The judge decided that Nike’s ability to call on a roster of international celebrities meant it has a marketing reach that cannot be adequately matched by New Balance.Following the ruling, a club spokesperson said: “Liverpool FC is pleased with the judge’s decision to rule in favour of the club following the legal dispute with our current kit supplier, New Balance.“We will continue with New Balance for the current season, in combination with preparing next season’s Liverpool kits with our new supplier.”Liverpool’s deal with Nike will be one of the biggest in the Premier League, and is a reflection of the club’s growing commercial power that has come from an upsurge in on-pitch performances under manager Jürgen Klopp.Earlier this year, Manchester City’s owner’s City Football Group signed a kitwear contract with Puma worth £60m a year over 10 years. The largest in the English football’s top division remains Manchester United’s £75m-a-year contract with Germany’s Adidas.Sportswear makers are offering ever-increasing sums to the world’s biggest clubs because of demand among fans to buy the shirts of their favourite teams.Industry executives have said the value of kitwear contracts reflect a side’s global popularity. The deals pay off over the long run, as a club usually receives only a small percentage from shirt sales, the vast majority of proceeds kept by the supplier.
10;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-24T17:26:44Z;Pence singles out Nike in speech critical of China;US vice-president cites Beijing’s ‘destabilising’ actions but says Washington doesn’t want to decouple;Mike Pence, the US vice-president, has chided China for becoming “even more aggressive and destabilising” over the past year and singled out Nike as he criticised corporate America for complicity with Beijing.In a long-awaited speech at the Wilson Center, a think-tank in the US capital, Mr Pence on Thursday insisted that Washington was not seeking confrontation with China or a decoupling of the world’s largest economies. But he attacked China for slashing “rights and liberties” in Hong Kong, building a “surveillance state unlike anything the world has ever seen”, continuing to “aid and abet the theft of our intellectual property” and pursuing military expansionism.He also criticised US multinational companies for kowtowing to Chinese officials, as they sought access to the Chinese market’s customers and supply chains. He specifically singled out Nike, the shoe company, for “checking its social conscience at the door” when it removed Houston Rockets merchandise from its shelves after the NBA basketball team’s general manager tweeted in support of protesters in Hong Kong.As for the NBA itself, Mr Pence said: “In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.”“A progressive corporate culture that wilfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive — it’s repressive,” he said. Yet even as Mr Pence listed US grievances with Beijing, he balanced the bluster with more conciliatory language. “The United States does not seek confrontation with China. We seek a level playing field, open markets, fair trade and a respect for our values,” he said.Mr Pence’s speech comes at a delicate moment in US-China trade relations, as top officials attempt to finalise a limited deal to ease trade tensions between the countries so that it can be signed next month by Donald Trump, the US president, and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart. Mr Pence said that Mr Trump remained “optimistic” that a deal could be reached.“America is reaching out our hand to China and we hope that soon Beijing will reach back, this time with deeds not words, and with renewed respect for America,” the vice-president said.Although China has agreed to increase its purchases of US agricultural goods, it has so far resisted any major concessions to overhaul its economic model by curbing its use of industrial subsidies, rein in cybertheft or entrench the equal treatment of US investors with domestic competitors.Meanwhile, the US has imposed tariffs on $360bn of Chinese imports, and is threatening to add levies on a further $156bn of goods on December 15 unless a settlement to the trade dispute is reached.With China hawks in Washington growing concerned that Mr Trump may stop at a minor deal with Beijing based on agricultural goods, Mr Pence suggested the administration would seek to maintain pressure on China about the deeper structural concerns. He said Mr Trump was committed to a “fundamental restructuring” of the relationship and would “stay the course”.The vice-president’s speech had been initially been planned for June 4, on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests in China, but was delayed to avoid throwing a wrench into the trade negotiations.Even as US and Chinese officials have moved to de-escalate trade tensions in recent weeks, Washington has continued to take or consider actions that have irked Beijing. Among them are a move to blacklist Chinese technology companies involved in surveillance and human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, which means US companies need a special government licence to sell to them.The US is also considering steps to limit Chinese access to US capital markets. Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, have been trying to separate those issues from the trade negotiations, but it is unclear if Beijing will be able to ignore them.
11;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-22T23:53:48Z;Nike’s Mark Parker to step aside as chief executive;PayPal chairman John Donahoe to become fourth head of the shoe and sportswear maker;Mark Parker is stepping aside as Nike’s chief executive, ending a 13-year tenure celebrated on Wall Street for the sportswear brand’s financial performance but also marked by a series of controversies including a recent doping scandal in athletics.The Oregon-based company said on Tuesday that Mr Parker would hand the reins in January to technology executive John Donahoe, a former Ebay chief who sits on Nike’s board.He will become Nike’s fourth chief executive in its 55-year history. Mr Parker will become executive chairman, with founder Phil Knight remaining as chairman emeritus.The change at the helm comes less than two weeks after Nike shut down its Oregon Project athletics training programme. Alberto Salazar, a Nike-supported athletics coach, and Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with athletes from the project, received four-year bans for doping violations.Mr Parker had been dragged into the scandal. Emails dating back to 2009 were published online that appeared to show he was briefed about doping-related tests conducted by Mr Salazar and Mr Brown that the US Anti-Doping Agency found fell foul of the rules.“This has absolutely nothing to do with that,” Mr Parker told CNBC television on Tuesday. He added that Nike had been spending “many months” on succession planning. “This is not something that happens in a number of weeks. It’s really unrelated to Oregon Project or any other issues,” he said.Mr Parker had made a robust defence of himself and Nike over the doping episode, criticising “highly misleading” coverage. Far from encouraging doping, he said the tests were designed to prevent the practice.Nike’s decision to turn to Mr Donahoe, chairman of PayPal and chief executive of cloud computing group ServiceNow, underlines its focus on digital transformation. Retail and consumer companies are trying to better deploy technology in areas from manufacturing to ecommerce.His move to Nike sent shares in ServiceNow down 10 per cent in after-hours trading. Nike shares initially eased after-hours as traders weighed up the implications of the change at the helm, but were later trading 0.4 per cent higher.The appointment came as a “bit of a surprise” but the transition at Nike “seems to have been well-planned”, said Cristina Fernández, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. She said Mr Donahoe’s skills and background as a public company chief executive “should serve the company well”.Among other challenges in recent months, Nike has been grappling with how to manage sensitive political issues in China, where it has a rapidly expanding business.Nike was reported to have pulled some NBA gear from some stores in the country after an American basketball executive’s tweet this month about the Hong Kong protests. Similarly in the summer the company cancelled a line of limited-edition shoes whose designer also voiced support of the protesters.Yet investors have shrugged off the controversies, sending Nike shares up about 29 per cent so far this year. Mr Donahoe said in a statement that he was looking forward to “building on Nike’s success and seizing the opportunities ahead”.It was the second leadership change in the sportswear sector on Tuesday. Kevin Plank, Under Armour’s founder, announced earlier he was stepping down as chief executive.
12;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-11T10:29:59Z;Nike shuts athletics training programme after doping scandal;Chief under pressure after emails show he was briefed on tests by banned coach;Nike said it will shut down the Oregon Project, the athletics training programme funded by the US sportswear giant, following a doping scandal that has engulfed the company.Earlier this month, Oregon Project head coach Alberto Salazar, who has trained some of the world’s best long-distance runners including the British Olympic champion Mo Farah, was banned from the sport for four years for doping violations. Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with athletes from the project, also received a four-year ban.Mark Parker, Nike’s chief executive, has come under pressure following the damaging revelation of internal emails showing he had been briefed about tests conducted by the coach and doctor designed to establish how much testosterone it would take to trigger a positive result from a doping test. While Mr Salazar and Mr Brown argued they did this over concern their athletes could be sabotaged, Usada, the US anti-doping agency, said the experiments could be used for “the nefarious purpose of evading doping control”.Mr Parker has previously defended his role, calling the correspondence “highly misleading” and denied the company was connected to doping violations. But on Friday, he told staff through an internal memo that Nike would shut down the training programme, which is based at its corporate headquarters in Portland, Oregon.He wrote: “I want to reiterate that Nike has always tried to put the athlete and their needs at the front of all our decisions. While the [Usada] panel found there was no orchestrated doping, no finding that performance-enhancing drugs have ever been used on Oregon Project athletes and went out of its way to note Alberto [Salazar]’s desire to follow all rules, ultimately Alberto can no longer coach while the appeal is pending. “This situation, along with ongoing unsubstantiated assertions is a distraction for many of the athletes and is compromising their ability to focus on their training and competition needs. I have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon project.”Mr Parker added that Nike would continue to support Mr Salazar, who is appealing his four-year suspension, saying the punishment “for someone who acted in good faith is wrong”.Nike has funded the Oregon Project, America’s elite long-distance running training centre, through a $460m 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field, the national governing body for the sport. Sponsoring and training the world’s best athletes is at the centrepiece of Nike’s strategy to dominate athletics, through which it planned to gain from sales of related sportswear such as trainers.
13;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-10T11:40:21Z;Nike risks being dragged into China NBA dispute;US sportswear group among biggest beneficiaries of basketball boom in China;Few western companies have more at stake than Nike in the fallout from an American basketball executive’s tweet about Hong Kong.The US sportswear group, whose Swoosh logo adorns NBA player kits under an exclusive deal with the league, has been among the biggest beneficiaries from a basketball boom in China.Since Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, sparked a dispute on the mainland this week with his support for democracy protests in Hong Kong, Wall Street has been left wondering whether the NBA’s difficulties will also become those of Nike.“The brand has been so hot over there,” said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. Such is the importance of China to the New York-listed company, which has a $115bn market capitalisation, that “one hiccup could spell problems” for the entire investment case.Revenues from Nike’s greater China division, based in Shanghai, leapt 22 per cent in the three months to the end of August, its 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth.The region is an even more important contributor to profits: while accounting for 16 per cent of group revenues in the quarter, it generated 36 per cent of the brand’s earnings before interest and tax. The popularity in China of basketball, and Nike as a label, is such that “they can go there and basically charge what they want”, as one retail analyst put it.Rival sportswear groups also are turning to China as domestic growth cools for certain products. They include Under Armour, which is also using basketball to promote its brand. The Baltimore-based company put Steph Curry, the Golden State Warriors superstar, on a tour of Asia in the summer with stops in Beijing and Shanghai. However, Under Armour’s exposure to China is far more limited than that of Nike.Symbolising Nike’s importance to basketball in the country is the NBA’s store in Beijing, its largest outside North America, which opened this year. Nike is behind the outlet along with Chinese sports retailer Topsports.To safeguard its future in the lucrative market, Nike has been willing to make concessions to keep the authorities and public onside. Mark Parker, chief executive, has described the brand as being “of China [and] for China”.In a sign the company is trying to manage the backlash against the NBA, Houston Rockets shoes and other goods have reportedly been pulled from several Nike stores in major Chinese cities. Local managers in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during store visits that they had been instructed in a memo from management to remove the items.Large Chinese ecommerce sites operated by Alibaba and JD.com had already removed the team’s merchandise from sale since the dispute erupted.It echoes an earlier incident in June, when the Financial Times disclosed that Nike cancelled sales of a line of trainers after their designer, Jun Takahashi, was critical of China. In a similar vein to Mr Morey, he had posted online a picture of Hong Kong protesters with the slogan “no extradition”.In common with other US businesses that are China-dependent, however, Nike faces the danger of upsetting local sensitivities on the one hand, while on the other it risks alienating its domestic audience if it is seen to betray American values.The group has not been shy of wading into political controversies closer to home, leaving it open to the charge of double standards. The Oregon-based company caused a stir in the US this year with an ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, an American footballer who refused to stand for the national anthem.“Athletes and coaches have spoken with impunity about civil rights and inequality when it comes to things happening in this country,” said Andrew Brandt, a sports law professor at Villanova University and a former Green Bay Packers executive. In contrast, he noted, there had for the most part been “silence” about the Hong Kong protests.Nike’s efforts to avoid being dragged into the dispute have been helped by the fact it was a sports team executive, rather than an employee of the company, who sent the offending tweet. Still, the storm is far from over. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, said on Twitter that he was waiting for Nike “and their stable of ‘woke’ social justice warrior/athletes to speak out”. The company did not respond to a request from the Financial Times to comment.Edginess has long been part of Nike’s branding. The company stuck with Tiger Woods through a scandal in the golfer’s private life. It is also standing behind Alberto Salazar, the athletics coach who this month received a four-year ban for performance-enhancing drug violations.While Nike’s approach to the likes of the Kaepernick episode had “made certain people mad”, the company had won business from other constituencies as a result, Mr Yarbrough said. In contrast, he cautioned, China posed a different set of reputational risks and controversies that “could be more lose-lose”.Nike shares fell as much as 3 per cent on Tuesday as investors tried to weigh up the risks, although they ticked up 0.9 per cent on Wednesday.Sam Poser, analyst at Susquehanna, wrote in a note that concerns about the impact on Nike were “overblown”. He argued that Chinese consumers “perceive Nike as a global athletic brand, not associated with any country or part of the world. Nike has been entrenched in China for over three decades and has established deep-rooted relationships.”Dean Crutchfield, founder of the Crutchfield and Partners brand consultancy, said that despite demands from the likes of Mr Rubio, he would advise the company to stay quiet. “Nike didn’t create this war,” he said. “Any crisis manager would say the same: avoid, avoid, avoid.”The episode could yet work to the company’s advantage, he added. “If they play it right, they’re going to sell a lot more merchandise.”
14;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-03T00:32:33Z;Nike’s chief executive says doping claims make him ‘sick’;Mark Parker moves to defend group’s reputation after athletics coach banned for violations;"Nike’s chairman and chief executive has defended himself and the sportswear company over suggestions it was connected to performance-enhancing drug violations, saying the idea the group was involved in doping “makes me sick”.Mark Parker’s defence of the New York-listed group’s reputation came as he also stood up for Alberto Salazar, a Nike-supported athletics coach who received a four-year ban from the sport this week.The US Anti-Doping Agency found Mr Salazar had been “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while head coach of Nike’s Oregon Project, a training programme funded by the company. Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with athletes from the project, also received a four-year ban.Following a six-year investigation by Usada, the men were found to have possessed and trafficked performance-enhancing drugs to athletes, and also to have helped to administer the substances in a prohibited way.To have my name and Nike’s name linked to this reckless mischaracterisation is offensiveAccording to arbitration documents published this week, the two men said they conducted tests to establish how much testosterone it would take to trigger a positive result on a doping test because they were concerned their athletes could be sabotaged.Usada countered that this was not an acceptable justification, since the same experiments could just as easily be used for “the nefarious purpose of evading doping control”.Emails dating back to 2009, published online this week, also appeared to show Mr Parker himself was briefed about the tests. In one note to Dr Brown, Mr Parker expressed an interest in the minimum amount of AndroGel, a testosterone product, that was needed to trigger “a positive result”.However, in a memo to employees, Mr Parker hit out at “highly misleading” coverage of the correspondence. Far from encouraging doping, he said the experiments were designed to prevent the practice.“To have my name and Nike’s name linked to this reckless mischaracterisation is offensive,” he wrote.Mr Parker added that he “had no reason to believe the test was outside any rules”. The Nike chief also stood by Mr Salazar — who is appealing — saying he had acted “in good faith”. According to the chief executive, the coach was “attempting to prevent doping of athletes — exactly the opposite of some of the commentary you may have heard”.He said: “Nike did not participate in any effort to systematically dope any runners ever; the very idea makes me sick.”Mr Parker added in the memo that while the American Arbitration Association upheld three charges against Mr Salazar, all were “committed without an intent or effect to dope or cheat”. Mr Salazar and Dr Brown have always denied wrongdoing.Tim Crow, an independent sports marketing expert, said Nike’s decision to stand by Mr Salazar was a major risk, although he added the company had a history of weathering sporting scandals.“If the appeal fails, then quite clearly Salazar becomes a non-person and Nike will have no option but to cut their ties with him,” Mr Crow said.“But Nike have gone from strength to strength for many years. All the indicators are that the brand and stock price is impervious to these sorts of incidents.“It goes back to the appeal [by Mr Salazar] and what light that shows on Mark Parker’s knowledge. [If the appeal fails] his position will be even more uncomfortable than it is now.”"
15;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-10-01T11:47:08Z;US coach Salazar banned for four years for doping violations;Decision comes after six-year investigation into Mo Farah’s former trainer;Alberto Salazar, the US athletics coach who has trained some of the world’s best long distance runners including the British Olympic champion Mo Farah, has been banned from the sport for four years for doping violations.The US Anti-doping agency (Usada) found that Mr Salazar had been “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while he was head coach of Nike’s Oregon Project, a training programme funded by the US sportswear company. Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with athletes from the project, also received a four year ban.The men were found to have possessed and trafficked performance-enhancing drugs to many athletes, as well as helping to administer the substances in a prohibited way, following a six year investigation launched by Usada. The allegations were first reported in 2015 by the BBC’s Panorama programme and US investigative website ProPublica.Travis Tygart, the chief executive of Usada, said that Mr Salazar and Mr Brown had “demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect”.Mr Salazar and Mr Brown, who have always denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. In a statement cited by US media, Mr Salazar said: “The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping. I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true.”The case has raised questions about the connections between UK Athletics, Mr Salazar and the Oregon project. Following a review of the allegations UK Athletics said in 2015 it found “no evidence of any impropriety” adding it had “no reason to be concerned” about Mr Salazar’s role in coaching Sir Mo, who is Britain’s greatest ever distance runner.Sir Mo, who trained at the Oregon Project for six years from 2011, a period in which he won four Olympic gold medals, has always denied wrongdoing and was not the target of the Usada investigation.In response to Usada’s ruling, Sir Mo said: “I’m relieved that Usada has, after four years, completed their investigation into Alberto Salazar.“I left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but, as I’ve always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line. I’m glad there has finally been a conclusion.”In a statement UK Athletics said: “The board of UK Athletics acknowledges the announcement made by Usada concerning the four year sanction imposed on Alberto Salazar.“The Board and Performance Oversight Committee will now review the arbitration decision in full prior to making any further comment.”The world governing body for the sport, the IAAF, said on Tuesday that it had “deactivated” Mr Salazar’s accreditation for the World Championships, currently taking place in Doha, Qatar.Nike funds the Oregon Project, America’s elite long-distance running training centre, on its company campus in Portland, Oregon, through a $460m 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field, the national governing body for the sport.“Today’s decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete,” Nike said. “As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping Code. “We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.”
16;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-09-27T22:00:27Z;Why JD Sports might meet its match in the US;Big brands are increasingly selling directly to customers, bypassing distributors;The test of a first-rate intelligence, said F Scott Fitzgerald, is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. By his measure, people of first-rate intelligence have been having a pretty good 2019.The FTSE 100’s best performer year to date has been JD Sports. The shoe shop’s shares have more than doubled since the start of January, outpacing a retail sector held back by familiar worries about online competition, rattled consumer confidence, over-extended credit lines and high street malaise.Neither is it an unprecedented event. JD Sports’ market value had already more than doubled in 2013, and in 2015, and had nearly trebled in both 1999 and 2009. It is the London main market’s top performer by far over the past two decades, rising more than 10,000 per cent. (Annual profit before tax over the same period has grown by about 3,000 per cent.)Many find the secret to its success impenetrable. JD Sports specialises in attracting the difficult to reach Generation Z cohort. Its typical customers are 14 to 20-year-old males, generally in less advantaged socio-economic groups, say analysts at RBC Capital Markets. “They are typically keen on fashion and want to be the coolest kid on the street.” Fashionability costs between £80 to £90 a purchase on average, usually paid in cash.The stock’s most recent re-rating was founded on hopes that JD Sports would repeat the trick in the US. Last year’s purchase of the underperforming Finish Line shoe store chain for £400m has given the group another 500-plus outlets to rebrand, refit and make Gen Z-compatible. Global buying power should also help JD Sports maintain a happy relationship with Nike and Adidas, which together account for an estimated 60 per cent of group sales.The cognitive dissonance in the investment case comes from across the pond.Nike this week hit a record high on forecast-busting quarterly results. The sportswear maker’s North American sales barely grew, but gross margins climbed thanks to Nike Direct, its direct-to-consumer business designed specifically to bypass distributors. (Adidas, of course, has a similar plan.)As they do every quarter, Nike executives talked a lot about how its own-label shops and online storefronts were only intended to replace “undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale”. The higher quality strategic partners like JD Sports were still adding to the bottom line. They had no reason to worry about their new-season supplies and exclusive edition drops that are seen as essential to the business model.Really? The promises and the evidence do not quite match up.JD Sports is Nike’s second-biggest global customer behind Foot Locker, whose US store fleet is about four times as big as Finish Line’s. Yet Foot Locker’s share of Nike’s US sales has been in decline since at least 2010, according to Stockviews estimates, and was overtaken by Nike Direct in 2015. The research house also found that just half of the 50 “must have” products on Nike’s own website were available online from Foot Locker and Finish Line.Foot Locker was always seen as a tougher competitor to JD Sports in the US than Sports Direct has been in the UK. The share price performance under Peter Cowgill, JD Sports’ long-serving chairman, suggests some faith is merited. So is caution, given his company’s duopoly of suppliers are doing so well building bypasses through a slow-growth, saturated marketplace.But at 20 times forward earnings, there is not a lot of caution baked into JD Sports’ share price. Any signs that the US expansion is not delivering as expected and the stock might begin to look like an expensive gamble on whether teenagers want to keep hanging around in malls.You probably read a story this week about how a grand old High Street name was killed off by blinkered management and changing consumer habits. Burdened by a capital structure wholly unsuited to the seasonal peaks and troughs of its income, the company slipped into oblivion once overseas backers attracted to the historic brand proved unwilling or unable to wear the cost of any rescue.And you perhaps read a story about how, on news of the failure, the share prices of direct competitors sprinted higher as analysts totted up the benefits of redistributed market share, improved pricing discipline and so forth.You could have read identical stories in 2008, when the failed company was Woolworths. The competitors expected to benefit then were HMV and Game Group, which entered administration in 2013 and 2012 respectively. Those trying to pick the winners this week from Thomas Cook’s liquidation should perhaps be mindful that, in times of structural change, schadenfreude has not proven wholly successful as an investment strategy.bryce.elder@ft.com
17;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-09-24T21:04:24Z;Nike results top view despite ‘volatile’ environment;Sportswear maker’s direct selling pays off, sending shares 5% higher;Athletic clothing and gear maker Nike on Tuesday reported upbeat quarterly results as its digital transformation and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers paid off despite a “volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment”.The Oregon-based company said its revenues rose 7 per cent from a year ago to $10.7bn in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding analysts’ expectations for $10.4bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.Revenues in North America, its largest market, rose 4 per cent to $4.29bn and sales grew across all geographies.“Our targeted strategic investments are accelerating Nike’s digital transformation and extending our competitive advantage,” said Andy Campion, chief financial officer. “Even amid the increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we expect our unrelenting focus on better serving the consumer to continue fuelling strong, broad-based growth across our global portfolio.”The company, like many other retailers, continues to face uncertainty stemming from the US-China trade war and the resulting retaliatory tariffs enacted by Washington and Beijing on each other’s goods. Despite that however, Nike’s sales in Greater China grew 22 per cent in the first quarter.The rise also came despite the backlash it faced on the mainland over support from one of its shoe designers for protests in Hong Kong.Shares jumped more than 5 per cent to $91.98 in after-hours trade.Net income climbed by a quarter to $1.37bn in the three months ended in August, up from $1.09bn in the year-ago quarter. That translated to earnings per share of 86 cents, up from 67 cents. That exceeded Wall Street expectations for 70 cents.The upbeat results also helped calm investors following Nike’s quarterly earnings miss in June — its first downbeat earnings in seven years.Gross margin climbed 150 basis points to 45.7 per cent driven by higher average selling prices and the expansion of its direct-to-consumer app Nike Direct, which were partially offset by strength in the US dollar and higher product costs.Nike, which faces competition from Adidas and Under Armour, has been investing to pitch its products directly to consumers and cut out the middleman. The moves have come as the sportswear maker looks to speed up product development, reduce the time taken to get its products to shelves and give it more control over pricing.Nike shares were up nearly 18 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close.
18;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-09-24T10:18:54Z;Liverpool FC kitwear supplier takes legal action against the club;Boston-based New Balance seeks clarity over right to match rival sponsorship offer from Nike;New Balance is taking legal action against Liverpool, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the English Premier League football club from signing a lucrative new shirt manufacturing deal with US sportswear giant Nike. Liverpool, which last season won the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious club competition, has a deal with Boston-headquartered New Balance which expires at the end of May 2020 and is worth an estimated £50m a year. Liverpool was ready to sign a new long-term kitwear agreement with Nike worth about £70m a year, according to multiple reports. But it has since emerged that New Balance was seeking to enforce a “matching clause” in its current deal, designed to allow the company to equal Nike’s offer in order to renew its contract. On Tuesday, Liverpool said: “We can confirm that our kit supplier, New Balance, has commenced a legal dispute against the club. We will not be making any further comment during these legal proceedings.” Nike declined to comment. Representatives for New Balance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in a statement to The Athletic, the sports news site which first reported the news of the legal action, New Balance said: “As a long-standing and committed sponsor, we are keen to continue our strong partnership with Liverpool Football Club and renew our agreement in 2020. In line with our current contract, we have matched the offer made by Nike. “As part of the contract renewal process, LFC has called into question elements of the agreement and as such we are asking the courts for clarity on this case. Both we and the club are keen to resolve any contractual challenges as quickly as possible and have agreed to an expedited process in the courts.” The battle, to be heard in the UK High Court, will revolve around the terms of the matching clause. The club has argued that New Balance does not have Nike’s unparalleled distribution network and so cannot adequately match its proposed deal. Liverpool’s proposed deal is one the biggest in the Premier League. Earlier this year, Manchester City’s owner’s City Football Group signed a kitwear contract with Puma worth £60m a year over 10 years. The largest in the English football’s top tier remains Manchester United’s £75m-a-year contract with Germany’s Adidas. Sportswear makers are offering ever-increasing sums to the world’s biggest clubs thanks to the insatiable appetite of fans to buy the shirts of their favourite teams, with the size of kitwear deals a reflection of a side’s global popularity. These deals pay off over the long run, as a club usually receives only a small percentage from shirt sales, the vast majority of proceeds kept by the supplier. 
19;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-07-02T16:04:35Z;Nike to lose Arizona plant incentives after it pulls US flag shoes;Sportswear maker criticised for acting on complaints about 18th-century ‘Betsy Ross flag’;Nike will miss out on promised financial incentives to build a plant in Arizona after the company was caught in the middle of another politically charged controversy for its decision to remove US Independence Day-themed shoes featuring an 18th-century American flag.Doug Ducey, Arizona’s Republican governor, said on Tuesday that his state would withdraw all financial incentives for a planned investment by Nike that was due to be announced on Tuesday. The incentives were aimed at encouraging Nike to locate production in the city of Goodyear, near Phoenix.“Nike has made its decision, and now we’re making ours,” Mr Ducey said on Twitter. “Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike”.Nike subsidiary Air Manufacturing Innovation had planned to invest $184.5m in the first development phase of a facility in Goodyear that would employ at least 505 people in full-time manufacturing roles, according to the Arizona Republic. Goodyear officials had agreed to waive up to almost $1m in plan review and permit fees, and reimburse Nike another $1m for the jobs created, the newspaper saidThe decision to pull the incentives came after Nike said it withdrew its Air Max 1 shoe ahead of the July 4 US holiday because it includes an old version of the US flag. Commonly known as the “Betsy Ross Flag”, the version features 13 stars in circle and 13 stripes, representing the original 13 American colonies, and first came into use in the 1790s.The Wall Street Journal said the shoes were pulled after former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick complained that the company should not sell shoes bearing a symbol that he and others found to be offensive due to its connection to the slavery era.Nike said in a statement that it made the decision to halt distribution of the shoe “based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday.”The decision drew the ire of Republicans on social media, including Ted Cruz, a US senator from Texas, who said in a tweet: “It’s a good thing @Nike only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag . . . ”Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain wrote on Twitter: “Just so you know how this works now: Nothing can happen in America any more if Colin Kaepernick doesn’t like it.”Nike, a major NFL sponsor, has in the past backed Mr Kaepernick for his political activism. In 2016 he catalysed a protest movement against police brutality by kneeling when the US national anthem was played at games. Last year the company made him the face of an advertising campaign that triggered calls for a Nike boycott. However, the company’s fiscal second-quarter results, which included the impact of the Kaepernick campaign, exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts.Nike last week cancelled the sale of a line of limited-edition sports shoes in China after the sportswear maker’s Japanese designer supported recent Hong Kong protests on Instagram, sparking a backlash in China.Writing on Twitter, Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, said of the two decisions: “Nike thinks American flag is symbol of oppression? What planet are you on? Nike gladly allows Chinese Communist party to tell it what products to sell while building its business around sweatshop labour. Nike is anti-American, pure & simple.”These cases highlight the dilemma faced by Nike and other companies that must weigh up the political and financial costs of taking stances on certain corporate or ethical issues. Earlier this year, several media companies media threatened to boycott Georgia, a film and television production hub, if a controversial anti-abortion law took effect in the US state.Nike shares, which are up 15 per cent in the year to date, fell 0.5 per cent on Tuesday to $85.09.
20;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Companies should balance profit with principles in China;Nike’s withdrawal of a shoe line is the latest in a series of foreign corporate mishaps;Almost weekly, foreign companies seem to be falling foul of Chinese sensitivities. Nike is the latest multinational to withdraw a product in the mainland, after a Japanese shoe designer expressed support for the recent Hong Kong protests. Some companies have made errors for which only they are to blame. Others unintentionally or inadvertently cause political or cultural offence.Nike’s case highlights the dilemma often faced by foreign companies operating in China: retain access to one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing markets, or stand up for corporate or ethical values. Balancing these competing demands is not easy, especially at a time of heightened tensions between the US and China over trade tariffs.Nike cancelled a line of limited-edition sports shoes after the Japan-based studio that designed it posted a picture on its Instagram account in support of the anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong. Nike’s swift removal of the offending shoe, and its reticence on the matter, speaks volumes about its focus on its bottom line.While the impact on Nike’s sales in China may be limited, the perception of bowing to political demands is jarring for a company that markets itself as the champion of social causes. Its action is hard to square with its own slogan in a 2018 ad campaign featuring the American footballer and antiracism protester Colin Kaepernick, who earned President Donald Trump’s wrath for refusing to stand during the US anthem: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”UBS, the Swiss bank, has done little better in handling the fallout from an originally harmless and inoffensive quip by a London-based economist in its wealth management arm. Paul Donovan joked in a morning call whose text was released to clients that an outbreak of swine flu had pushed up Chinese consumer prices, but largely only mattered “if you are a Chinese pig”. A translation of the phrase into Mandarin was wrongly interpreted as racist, provoking a social media backlash.China’s financial regulator weighed in, urging financial groups not to cite the UBS note or to invite Mr Donovan to speak at client events. It also labelled him unwelcome in the country, making it difficult for him to return to his role regardless of the bank’s decision on his continuing period of enforced leave.Both UBS and Mr Donovan quickly apologised, but the bank faced client complaints and lost out on a bond mandate. Given the importance of China for UBS’s business — it is the first foreign bank given approval to own a majority share in its local securities business — the responsibility to its shareholders is compelling. But it has a responsibility, too, to protect and defend Mr Donovan, who did nothing wrong.An advertising campaign by Dolce & Gabbana late last year was a more clear-cut case of cultural tone-deafness. Pictures showing a Chinese model eating pizza with chopsticks were judged, rightly, as offensive. The company’s Shanghai fashion show was cancelled and products dropped by retailers. The designers issued an apology, fearing loss of access to one of their most important markets.If they want foreign investment, China’s authorities should not seek to fuel public or social media outrage over corporate mis-steps. Given both the size and complexity of the Chinese market, companies themselves must do their homework to avoid silly mistakes. If problems do arise, however, businesses should balance the need to preserve profits for shareholders with a duty towards employees. Simply kowtowing is not the right response.

Quarterly revenues from the region jumped 16 per cent to $1.17bn — four times faster than the group as a whole.The Financial Times revealed this week that Nike, based in Oregon, cancelled sales in China of a line of limited-edition trainers designed by Undercover, the studio of Japanese designer Jun Takahashi. Mr Takahashi had posted a picture of protesters with the slogan “no extradition to China”, a reference to Hong Kong’s proposed extradition bill, on its Instagram account.Describing the China business as a “blueprint” for other parts of the business, Mr Parker told Wall Street analysts: “We are and remain a brand of China and for China.”We’re certainly mindful of the [trade] risks and more importantly we’re in command of the conditions that are under our controlHe added: “We’re confident that we’ll continue to grow sport and our business in China for decades to come.”Nike’s earnings were also helped by direct sales to consumers, as it sold more items online at full price. Sales across the group came in at $10.18bn for the three months to the end of May, a 4 per cent rise from the year-ago period.However, higher selling prices were not enough to fully offset the effect of rising marketing and supply chain investments, a higher corporate tax rate and a stronger dollar. Net income fell 13 per cent year-on-year during the quarter to $939m, or 62 cents a share.Shares in Nike were 0.8 per cent lower in after-market trading, as analysts on average had expected earnings of 66 cents a share.In the run-up to Thursday’s earnings, investors have been nervously trying to gauge how Nike would be affected by the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China.Washington increased tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods in May, and Donald Trump has threatened to place levies on another $300bn in US imports from China.Nike and more than 170 other American shoe companies and retailers have warned the US president of “catastrophic” consequences if the new tariffs were to be implemented.Mr Parker added on Thursday: “Geopolitical dynamics have led to trade tensions and foreign exchange volatility.“We’re certainly mindful of the risks and more importantly we’re in command of the conditions that are under our control . . . delivering great product, engaging experiences, and building our brand. Our greater China business is the blueprint.”

Chinese retailers halted sales of the trainers designed by Undercover, the studio of Japanese designer Jun Takahashi, after it posted a picture of protesters with the slogan “no extradition to China” — in reference to Hong Kong’s proposed extradition bill — on its Instagram account this month. The post provoked a backlash from Chinese Instagram users, who use VPN software to access the platform as it is blocked on the mainland. Undercover deleted the post, which it said was an “individual opinion” posted by mistake.YYSports, a Chinese retailer owned by Hong Kong-listed Pou Sheng International, Nike’s strategic partner in China, said in a social media post that it had received an “urgent notice” from the US sportswear maker resulting in the cancellation of the shoe’s release on June 14. Other Chinese vendors withdrew the shoes from sale without explanation. Online vendor Douniu said it had removed all products related to the Undercover brand due to “special reasons”, without giving details.A spokesperson for Nike said: “Based on feedback from Chinese consumers, we have withdrawn from China a small number of products that were designed by a collaborator.”The controversy is unlikely to have a significant impact on Nike’s revenues in China, as it was swiftly dealt with and the shoes were designed as a collector’s item rather than a mass-market product, said a person close to the company.But the issue highlights the difficulties multinational companies face adjusting to political sensitivities in China without being seen by consumers in more politically liberal countries as yielding to authoritarian demands. Nike has marketed itself as a champion of social causes. This included last year hiring Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who was part of a protest movement against US police brutality against African-Americans, as the face of a high-profile advertising campaign.Last year, German carmaker Mercedes-Benz apologised to Chinese consumers twice after using a quote from the Dalai Lama in a post on its Instagram account. Beijing views the exiled spiritual Tibetan leader as a dangerous separatist. US clothing retailer Gap was also targeted last year after a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media network, that showed T-shirts with a map of China that did not include Taiwan, south Tibet and the South China Sea. Gap issued an apology. Nike and its rival Adidas have experienced rapid growth in China in recent years as exercise becomes more popular along with “athleisure” fashion. Nike generated sales of $5.1bn in greater China in 2018, up 18 per cent from the previous year in currency-adjusted terms.Some Chinese media called for a ban on the Undercover brand. “Making money from Chinese people and doing things which hurt China, Undercover you are disgusting . . . please get out of China,” said an article published by Sneaker News, a Chinese website.

24;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-03-25T21:36:02Z;Michael Avenatti charged with attempt to extort $20m from Nike;Anti-Trump lawyer also faces fresh charges in separate case over wire and bank fraud;Michael Avenatti, the attorney who gained fame through his representation of adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her fight with President Donald Trump, has been arrested for allegedly hatching a multimillion dollar extortion plot against sportswear maker Nike, and is also facing charges of misappropriating a client’s money.According to a criminal complaint unsealed on Monday in the southern district of New York, Mr Avenatti and a fellow lawyer approached Nike’s representatives last week with supposedly damaging information about payments the company had made to high school basketball players.Unless Nike handed over at least $22.5m, Mr Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference that he claimed would “take ten billion dollars off your client’s market cap . . . I’m not fucking around”, the complaint said.The money included $1.5m for Mr Avenatti’s client — a California youth basketball coach, whose team’s contract with Nike had lapsed — and the remainder for him and another lawyer to conduct an internal investigation.Mr Avenatti could not immediately be reached for comment. The fellow lawyer — who was not indicted — was Mark Geragos, according to people briefed on the matter. His office declined to comment.[You ever] held the balls of the client in your hand where you could take $5bn to $6bn market cap off of them?Geoffrey Berman, the Manhattan US attorney, accused Mr Avenatti of a “shakedown”, saying: “Calling this anticipated payout a retainer or a settlement doesn’t change what it was — a shakedown. When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys. They are acting as criminals.”Meanwhile, separate charges were filed on Monday by the US attorney’s office for the central district of California, alleging bank and wire fraud.According to those prosecutors, Mr Avenatti allegedly misled a client about a $1.6m settlement and then used some of the money to cover his own expenses, as well as those of his coffee business, Global Baristas.They also accused Mr Avenatti of fabricating tax returns for 2011, 2012 and 2013 that showed inflated income so that he could secure a $4.1m loan for his coffee business and law office from a bank in Mississippi.The arrest marks a stunning come-uppance for a brash figure who emerged from obscurity to become a leading character in the legal dramas surrounding Mr Trump.It has given the White House further cause for celebration a day after the attorney-general announced that a special counsel had not found evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.Mr Avenatti entered Mr Trump’s orbit through his representation of Ms Daniels. Her claim of an extramarital affair with Mr Trump eventually resulted in the conviction of the president’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a hush money payment that ran afoul of campaign finance law.Seizing the limelight, Mr Avenatti became a regular antagonist of the president on cable television and, as his profile grew, late last year embarked on a national tour to build support for a presidential campaign. In private gatherings with potential backers, Mr Avenatti would hold himself up as the only man capable of going toe-to-toe with President Trump.Those plans were abandoned after he was arrested in November for allegedly assaulting a girlfriend. Mr Avenatti denied those charges and earlier this year law enforcement officials said that he would not face criminal charges over the alleged episode of domestic violence.In a statement, Ms Daniels — who has broken ties with Mr Avenatti — said she was “saddened but not shocked” by the reports.The charges against Mr Avenatti were unveiled on Monday less than an hour after he tweeted that he would hold a press conference on Tuesday morning to disclose “a major high school/college basketball scandal perpetrated by @Nike”.“This criminal conduct reaches the highest levels of Nike and involves some of the biggest names in college basketball”, he said in the tweet.Nike said in a statement that it “will not be extorted or hide information that is relevant to a government investigation”. It said that it has co-operated with federal prosecutors and that its outside counsel at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner had assisted in the investigation.Nike shares dipped as much as 1.6 per cent following Mr Avenatti’s tweet, but trimmed the losses to be 0.9 per cent lower against a 0.1 per cent decline for the broader market.The New York complaint describes the pressure tactics employed by an aggressive lawyer stalking one of the largest US companies.After arranging a meeting at his co-conspirator’s office in New York, Mr Avenatti laid out his information and threatened to go public unless Nike paid up, according to the complaint.The meeting took place on March 19, at a time of maximum vulnerability for the company. Its quarterly earnings call was within two days and the annual university basketball championships, a key showcase for the company, was in full swing.If this is not papered on Monday, we are done. I don’t want to hear about somebody on a bike trip. I don’t want to hear that . . . somebody’s grandmother passed awayNike and its representatives played for time while contacting authorities. At another meeting two days later, one of the external attorneys explained that the company had never paid more than $10m for an outside investigation.In response, Mr Avenatti allegedly asked if the attorney had ever “held the balls of the client in your hand where you could take $5bn to $6bn market cap off of them?”Later, as the negotiations appeared to progress, Mr Avenatti provided his view of how things would play out if the talks failed: as soon as the matter became public, people would call from all over the country, offering potential evidence.“This is always what happens,” Mr Avenatti said, according to the complaint. “Now, 90 per cent of that is going to be bullshit because it’s always bullshit 90 per cent of the time, always, whether it’s R. Kelly or Trump, the list goes on and on — but 10 per cent of it is actually going to be true, and then what’s going to happen is that this is going to snowball.”The parties agreed to another meeting on Monday, March 25, and Mr Avenatti warned against further delays, telling the other attorneys: “If this is not papered on Monday, we are done. I don’t want to hear about somebody on a bike trip. I don’t want to hear that somebody has, that somebody’s grandmother passed away.”Soon after, Mr Avenatti took to Twitter and authorities moved in.
25;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-03-25T11:38:24Z;EU fines Nike for breaching competition rules on cross-border sales;Brussels cracks down on US sportswear group pushing prices up through sales ban;Brussels fined Nike €12.5m for unlawfully restricting cross-border sales of football shirts, scarves and other merchandise, raising prices and reducing choice for consumers.EU officials concluded that, between 2004 to 2017, Nike broke the bloc’s antitrust rules when it banned retailers from selling merchandise for clubs, such as FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Juventus, Inter Milan and AS Roma, as well as some national football federations, into other countries in the European economic area.Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, said: “Football fans often cherish branded products from their favourite teams, such as jerseys or scarves. Nike prevented many of its licensees from selling these branded products in a different country, leading to less choice and higher prices for consumers. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Today’s decision makes sure that retailers and consumers can take full advantage of one of the main benefits of the single market: the ability to shop around Europe for a larger variety of products and for the best deals.”Nike co-operated with the investigation and the fine was thereby reduced by 40 per cent.The case was launched in June 2017 as part of Brussels’ crackdown on restrictions on retailers that prevent people buying from websites based in another member state, so-called geo-blocking, which is a breach of the EU’s competition rules.Two separate probes that opened at the same time continue to investigate geo-blocking restrictions on Sanrio’s licences for brands such as Hello Kitty and Universal Studios’ merchandising rights for films such as Despicable Me and Minions.EU officials also continue to investigate Nike’s tax arrangements in the Netherlands as part of the enforcer’s crackdown on sweetheart tax deals that has caught out companies, including Apple, Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat and Engie.
26;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-03-21T21:26:11Z;Nike’s North America growth cools;;Athletic wear maker Nike on Thursday posted better than expected earnings in its fiscal third quarter but slowing growth in North America disappointed investors.Revenues jumped 7 per cent to $9.6bn in the three months ended February 28, broadly in line with analyst expectations. However revenues in North America, its largest market, underwhelmed.Sales rose 7 per cent year-on-year to $3.81bn in North America, shy of analysts' expectations for $3.87bn, according to Refinitiv. That was also slower than the 9 per cent increase reported in the previous quarter. It is worth noting the crucial Thanksgiving shopping week fell in the company’s fiscal second quarter.In China, considered to be a large growth market for Nike, revenues rose 19 per cent from a year ago to $1.59bn. That was also slower than the 26 per cent increase recorded the previous quarter.Nike shares fell nearly 4 per cent to $85.01 in after-hours trade.However, the Oregon-based company swung to a profit of $1.1bn, or 68 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $921m, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. That also topped analysts’ expectations for 67 cents.Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 45.1 per cent driven by higher average selling prices, growth in its direct-to-consumer business and favourable foreign exchange.“Our business momentum is being accelerated by our ability to scale innovation at a faster pace and expand new digital consumer experiences around the world,” said Mark Parker, chief executive.In 2017, Nike announced an overhaul of its business to emphasise selling directly to consumers and move away from relying on third-party brick-and-mortar retailers. The company, at the time, announced 1,400 job cuts, along with plans to reduce the number of items it sells by 25 per cent to help get products to shelves faster and boost product development.Nike shares were up nearly 19 per cent year-to-date as of Thursday’s close.
27;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-02-28T08:00:24Z;Manchester City signs shirt deal with Puma worth up to £600m;German sportswear brand agrees to 10-year contract with City Football Group;Manchester City has signed the biggest commercial deal in its history, securing a shirt sponsorship deal with Puma worth up to £600m, as the two groups challenge more storied rivals in their respective industries.The German sportswear group will on Thursday announce a “long-term strategic partnership” with City Football Group, the owner of Manchester City, to supply kits for the English Premier League champions and its sister clubs in four other countries.The deal is the largest of its kind for Puma and is a marked increase from Manchester City’s current six-year deal with Nike, worth roughly £20m a year according to people familiar with its terms.Puma will pay “up to” £600m over 10 years, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.One person close to the sportswear brand’s leadership added that it does not expect to pay the full amount. The final sum will be affected by performance-related factors, such as if Manchester City repeatedly wins the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious club football competition — a tournament it is yet to triumph in.The companies declined to comment on the terms of the deal, but Puma chief executive Bjorn Gulden said: “The more we pay, the better the deal is.” In the Premier League, CFG’s deal is behind only Manchester United’s £75m a year contract with Adidas, while broadly matching Chelsea’s £60m a year deal with Nike.Puma is spending big as it seeks to break the dominance of Nike and Adidas in the global sportswear market.It already has shirt supply agreements with some major European clubs such as England’s Arsenal, Germany’s Borussia Dortmund and Italy’s AC Milan, but has also signed endorsement deals with influential celebrities such as singer Rihanna and rapper Jay-Z.The strategy has helped to lead a turnround at the German company, which was spun out of French luxury group Kering in May. Throughout 2018, Puma repeatedly raised its sales outlook, leading to its share price climbing more than a third over the past 12 months. It has a market capitalisation of more than €7bn.“We have turned the company around from not being good at all, to being decent, but there is a long way to go,” said Mr Gulden. “City is another step in becoming even better than we were last year.”Football club deals are valuable because sportswear brands typically keep the lion’s share of retail sales.“Traditionally, Nike and Adidas had the top teams sewn up,” said Nigel Currie, founder of NC Partnership, a sports consultancy. “This is what the likes of Puma have to do . . . the top teams deliver massive results in global sales.”The contract, which begins next season, covers Manchester City as well as CFG-controlled clubs in Australia, Spain, Uruguay and China. It does not include New York City FC, with US Major League Soccer having negotiated a kit deal with Adidas that covers all American top-tier clubs.CFG’s model of collective ownership is, in part, designed to generate bigger revenues from global sponsors paying to be associated across all the partner clubs. CFG chief executive Ferran Soriano said the Puma sponsorship “will reset the model for sports partnerships on a truly global scale”. Critics argue the strategy is intended to bypass Europe’s so-called Financial Fair Play rules which prevent clubs from spending beyond their means on players. Uefa, European football’s governing body, has said is looking at reopening past FFP investigations into Manchester City after leaked club communications suggested it artificially inflated the value of sponsorship deals with undeclared additional funding from owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the billionaire businessman and member of the Abu Dhabi royal family. Manchester City has declined to comment on the allegations, saying: “The attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear.”
28;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-02-21T22:19:37Z;Nike: sole proprietor;A star’s exploding shoe is unable to stop the sportswear maker from staying on top of its game;Nike would like you to believe that if you slip on its shoes you will jump higher. Wear its shirts and sweat will evaporate quicker. But as with most consumer companies, outperformance ultimately depends upon a brand. That cachet can buckle as quickly as a star basketball player’s knee.On Wednesday night one such college star, Zion Williamson, injured his right knee as the Nike shoe on his left foot disintegrated. Mr Williamson is college basketball’s most celebrated player. Moreover, the game between his Duke University team and arch rival University of North Carolina featured a national TV audience as well as former president Barack Obama in the front row.The social media reaction was harsh, as it habitually is. A viral video featured Mr Obama’s astonishment.Thankfully for investors, Nike is on top of its game. The shares are up 44 per cent in the past two years. Previously high-flying rivals such as Under Armour have stumbled.Nike’s market worth has soared to $130bn. For good reason. It has compounded its revenues and earnings per share at 8 per cent and 15 per cent rates, respectively. And the stable of jocks who promote its wares are among the biggest sports stars in the world.The group has made some canny decisions. While traditionally sneakers have been sold through high street and shopping mall retailers, by 2023 Nike expects a third of its sales will be through its direct channels. The move is paying off. Gross margin in its most recent quarter jumped 80 basis points to almost 44 per cent. The direct channel also has better margins.Nike’s forward earnings multiple has jumped to 31 times, a level where even a minor gaffe like an exploding sneaker might hurt. In fact, its shares barely wobbled.Mr Williamson will soon turn professional. The resulting scramble among shoe executives to sign him up to an endorsement deal could leave them with injuries of their own.
29;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike signs its first clean energy deal in Europe with Iberdrola;All sportswear maker’s offices in Europe to be powered by renewables by 2020;Nike has signed its first European clean energy deal with Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, marking the latest in a series of corporate power purchase agreements that have provided a boost to the renewables industry.The deal follows record-setting corporate clean energy agreements last year, which more than doubled compared with the previous year, and helped fund the equivalent of 8 per cent of new wind and solar projects.The Nike agreement to buy 40MW of power from Iberdrola’s wind project in northern Spain will mean that all of the sportswear maker’s offices in Europe will be powered by renewable energy by 2020, when the Spanish wind farm is complete.Corporations have emerged as some of the biggest funders of clean energy projects, a trend that started with tech companies like Facebook and Google buying power for their data centres, and has since spread to heavy industry and retail.Total corporate clean power purchases in the past decade have reached 32GW, enough to power the Netherlands, with 40 per cent of those deals taking place last year, according to BloombergNEF.“There is a strong market in Europe for renewable [power purchase agreement] deals,” says Xabier Viteri, head of renewables at Iberdrola. He added that these corporate deals were “a good way of trying to secure the profitability of the projects”.For Nike, the deal — estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars — is the third clean power agreement it has reached with Iberdrola, following two solar deals last year in the US, its home market.Nike has pledged to move towards 100 per cent renewable energy globally, and says it will be about 75 per cent of the way toward its goal once the Spanish wind farm comes online.When companies make clean power deals, often called power purchase agreements, they typically do not receive the actual electrons generated by the wind or solar projects.This latest agreement means we will be operating on 100 per cent renewable energy across Europe by 2020Instead both sides buy and sell electricity to the grid, but then settle with each other based on an agreed price — in effect creating a price guarantee for both sides, as well as generating low-carbon credits for the corporate buyer.Developers of renewable energy projects say these deals provide certainty about a project’s future revenue stream, and can lower their cost of capital.The latest Nike deal, which will buy power from Iberdrola’s Cavar wind complex, is the first clean power deal that the sports retailer has done in Europe. Noel Kinder, Nike’s chief sustainability officer, said: “We know that the future of sport is interlocked with the future of our planet.”He added: “In 2018, we announced that we had contracted for 100 per cent renewable energy in North America, and this latest agreement means we will be operating on 100 per cent renewable energy across Europe by 2020.”
30;NKE;Nike Inc;2019-01-10T12:56:28Z;EU opens probe into Nike’s Dutch tax arrangements;Competition watchdog investigates whether footwear maker breached state aid rules;Brussels is probing alleged sweetheart tax deals between Nike and the Netherlands in the latest phase of a clampdown on illegal state support that has stoked tensions with Washington.The investigation announced on Thursday relates to five Dutch tax rulings on companies that the US group uses to develop, market and record sales for its products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said on Thursday: “Member states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors.”Under EU state aid rules, the European Commission has the power to require the Netherlands to recoup any illegal state support that Nike, the world’s largest sports footwear and athletic company, has received since 2009.The move is the latest in a series of probes into unlawful tax arrangements, which have caught out companies including Apple, Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat and Engie.Ms Vestager’s decisions against some of America’s most well-known companies prompted US president Donald Trump to dub her the “tax lady” who “really hates the US”.The commission rejects any suggestion of bias, pointing to dozens of European companies also caught in the crackdown on favourable tax rulings.Responding to the announcement of the investigation, the Dutch government said: “This does not mean that the commission has already reached a verdict, but merely that they have doubts whether or not there was state aid. Of course we will fully support the work of the commission.”Tax rulings should “do nothing else than give certainty in advance on the application of tax laws, and should not lead to preferential treatment”, the government said.The commission’s concerns focus on the method used to calculate royalty payments within the Nike corporate structure, which was endorsed by the Netherlands in the tax rulings. Two of the decisions remain in force.Nike European Operations Netherlands and Converse Netherlands hold licences on the rights to sell group products in Europe, but pay a royalty for the rights to two other Nike group companies that are “transparent” for tax purposes.As a result, the two companies handling sales and development, which employ more than 1,000 people, are only taxed in the Netherlands “on a limited operating margin based on sales”, according to the commission.Meanwhile, the Nike group companies receiving royalties pay no tax, “have no employees and do not carry out any economic activity”.The commission added in its statement: “At this stage, the commission is concerned that the royalty payments endorsed by the rulings may not reflect economic reality. They appear to be higher than what independent companies negotiating on market terms would have agreed between themselves.”The commission’s case, which turns on Dutch authorities accepting an “unduly reduced” estimate of the taxable income, has echoes of the investigation it launched against Apple and Ireland, which resulted in the US tech group paying €14.3bn in back taxes to Ireland. Apple’s appeal at the European Court of Justice is backed by the Trump administration.Ms Vestager’s tax state aid case against Nike is one of more than half a dozen that have been opened by the commission since June 2013. To date, the commission has found Luxembourg provided unlawful support to Fiat, Amazon and Engie, worth €23.1m, €282.7m and €120m respectively.The Netherlands was also found to have provided €25.7m of illicit support to Starbucks. An investigation into the Dutch corporate structures used by Ikea is continuing. Only one commission case — against McDonald's — has been dropped.Nike, responding to the announcement of the probe on Thursday, said the company was “subject to and rigorously ensures that it complies with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands”. It called the commission’s investigation “without merit”.
31;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-12-21T16:42:08Z;Foot Locker sprints higher after Nike sales surge;Nike’s CEO credited the retailer for its role in driving growth;Foot Locker sprinted higher on Friday after Nike credited the sneaker and sportswear chain for playing a role in driving a big sales boost during the latest quarter.Robust demand for Nike products bodes well for sporting-goods retailers, particularly Foot Locker, which buys roughly two-thirds of its merchandise from the “swoosh” brand. Direct-to-consumer sales online drove growth at Nike in the second quarter, reflecting the group’s efforts to reduce its reliance on brick-and-mortar retailers that have seen foot traffic dwindle amid consumers’ shift toward ecommerce.But Nike also cheered Foot Locker on an earnings call with analysts, saying the wholesale business registered a stronger quarter than the company anticipated.“We feel really great about the growth in digital as we’ve stressed continuously in our prepared remarks, but we also mentioned the increase on the wholesale side beyond expectations there. And I think that’s driven by the elevation of the experience . . . particularly with Foot Locker and [Dick’s Sporting Goods] for example,” chief executive Mark Parker said.Mr Parker also noted that Nike’s wholesale unit, “led by our strategic retail partners such as Foot Locker,” has seen its profitability improve.It wasn’t the first time that Nike has given Foot Locker a shout-out for its performance, with management saying in September that customer experiences at the retailer have supported sales growth at a time when shoppers are moving online.Shares of Foot Locker jumped as much as 6 per cent on Friday morning, making Foot Locker one of the top performers in the S&P 500. Nike was the leading member of the Dow, with shares climbing 10 per cent at its highs.Nike said late Thursday its second-quarter revenue climbed 10 per cent to $9.37bn, easily beating Wall Street’s forecast by $200m. North America, Nike’s largest market, recorded a 9 per cent increase in sales during the period, which ended on November 30.Strength at Nike offers a sign that sales gained momentum heading into the critical holiday season. Just before Thanksgiving, Foot Locker painted an upbeat outlook for holiday shopping as it reported quarterly earnings and sales that beat estimates.“We believe we are well positioned to produce even stronger results in the all-important holiday selling season and the fourth quarter overall,” chief executive Richard Johnson said at the time.
32;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
33;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-12-20T23:11:54Z;Nike tops forecasts as direct-to-consumer strategy pays off;;"Nike’s efforts to sell more products directly to consumers and cut out the middleman appears to be paying off.The world’s largest sports footwear and athletic company blew past Wall Street expectations for its latest quarterly results on Thursday as it sold more items online at full price in its key North American market, news that sent its shares up 7 per cent in after-market trading.For the fiscal second quarter that ended on November 30, revenue jumped 10 per cent to $9.37bn while net income also climbed by a similar margin to $997m, or 52 cents per diluted share. Both figures handily topped analysts forecast of $9.17bn and $737.4m, or 46 cents a share.Nike announced last June a major overhaul of its business in a bid to reduce its reliance on third-party brick-and-mortar retailers, which have been battling dwindling footfall, to sell its array of sneakers and athletic clothes.As part of the restructuring, the company laid off about 1,400 workers — or 2 per cent of its workforce. It also announced plans to reduce the number of items it sells by 25 per cent in order to speed up product development and cut the lead time needed to get new items on the shelves.The efforts have yielded dividends in North America — Nike’s largest market — with sales there up 9 per cent during the quarter to $3.78bn. Europe and Greater China, the next two biggest markets by revenue, also turned in strong performance, with sales up 8 per cent and 26 per cent respectively to $2.31bn and $1.54bn.By selling directly to more consumers, Nike has been able to regain more control over the pricing for its products and preserve margins. Gross margins rose 80 basis points to 43.8 per cent during the quarter, with the higher selling prices more than helping to offset rising input and transport costs.“Nike’s ambitious digital transformation is driving strong results and momentum in North America and in our international geographies,” said Mark Parker, chairman, president and chief executive. “We’re incredibly energised about 2019 — with a full innovation pipeline; the most personal, responsive retail experiences in the industry; and a supply chain that’s delivering speed at scale.”Nike did not make any mention of how its decision to use Colin Kaepernick in September as the face of a controversial ad campaign may have affected sales. The former football quarterback sparked national debate for deciding to ‘take a knee’ during the playing of the US national anthem at NFL matches. Nike’s decision to use him as the face of its latest advertising campaign celebrating the 30th anniversary of the ‘Just do it’ slogan was initially met with a mix of praise and protest, with some consumers burning their Nike shoes or vowing to boycott the brand.Shares in the company are down 21 per cent since late September but remain up about 8 per cent for the year to date."

He recently returned to the island for family reasons but said he would have preferred to stay in Vietnam.Zoe Wu, a former colleague of Mr Su at Dean Shoes, said she moved to work at the footwear maker in Vietnam after realising she was not able to save any money as a trade assistant at a souvenir company in Taipei.Her employer not only offers daily meals, accommodation, cleaning and laundry services, but also provides seven free round-trips to Taiwan a year and 55 days of paid leave. Ms Wu, 29, said it was easy to save more than half her salary due to the low living costs.“I earn twice what I could get in Taiwan,” said Ms Wu, who leads a team helping the likes of Nike, Asics and New Balance develop footwear. “It’s very easy for people to save up to $30,000 in two or three years here. That’s something I could never imagine if I just stayed in Taipei.”This article is from the Nikkei Asian Review, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspectives on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.Subscribe | Group subscriptionsMany of the more than 110,000 Taiwanese such as Mr Su and Ms Wu working in south-east Asia say they have higher salaries and better promotion prospects than their peers back home.In the past, they may have gone to work in China, but rising labour costs — and now rising trade tensions — are prompting Taiwanese companies to shift production to places such as Vietnam and India. While the government in Taipei welcomes the exodus of talent, saying it helps young Taiwanese gain skills, lawmakers are discussing whether to offer citizenship to more students and skilled workers from south-east Asia to boost the island’s shrinking labour force.“The government should be worried that there is less talent coming the other way from south-east Asian countries,” said Gordon Sun, director of the macroeconomic forecasting centre at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. “This is causing a brain drain.”Mr Sun said the starting wage for Taiwanese graduates in Vietnam would be at least 35,000 New Taiwan dollars ($1,140) a month, adding that it can rise to between $1,500 and $1,600 after a probationary period. That compares to $927 back home, according to labour ministry data for 2017.And jobs in Taiwan are getting sparser. The youth unemployment rate has exceeded 10 per cent for nine straight years, with the level for people aged 20 to 24 standing at 12.8 per cent in August — compared with 3.9 per cent across the board.Economies such as Vietnam and India are growing at about 7 per cent a year and may become even more attractive destinations for young people in Taiwan, which expanded just 2.8 per cent last year.The number of Taiwanese aged between 25 and 29 heading to work in south-east Asia jumped 62 per cent in the three years to 2017, according to data from 104 Job Bank, Taiwan’s leading online recruitment agency. The number of people applying for vacancies in the region rose 33 per cent to 53,137.The escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing is also prompting Taiwanese companies to shift production away from China.“We are seeing a clear trend of both companies and workers flowing to south-east Asia and India this year,” said Karen Ma, a researcher at Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute. “The business environment is deteriorating in China, and the trade war provides fresh incentives for talent and companies to quickly expand to new locations beyond China.”Outbound investment from Taiwan to south-east Asia and India rose 54 per cent from a year earlier to $3.68bn in 2017, according to Taiwan’s Trade Negotiation Office. For China, the figure fell 4.8 per cent on the year — a second straight annual drop — to $8.74bn.In addition to footwear suppliers such as Eclat Textile, Pou Chen and Feng Tay shifting a chunk of manufacturing to south-east Asia, key tech companies such as Advantech — the world’s largest industrial PC maker by market share — and big Apple suppliers including Hon Hai Precision Industry and Pegatron are all moving some production to the region. Many also see huge demand potential in these countries.“We’ve been seeing more and more Taiwanese companies and young Taiwanese come to Vietnam over the years,” said Michael Hsieh, chief strategy officer of food company Vedan International Holding, one of the earliest Taiwanese investors in Vietnam. “It’s a massive market in itself.”While lawmakers debate a bill to make it easier for skilled south-east Asian workers to obtain permanent residency in Taiwan, the government of President Tsai Ing-wen says it welcomes the outflow of talent.Ties between Beijing and Taipei have deteriorated since Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive party took office in 2016. Her administration has been pushing its “New Southbound Policy” to encourage companies to develop deeper ties with south-east Asia and reduce the island’s reliance on China, its biggest trade partner.“We don’t see the outflow of young talent to south-east Asian partners as a bad thing to Taiwan,” John Deng, an executive minister without portfolio, told Nikkei in an interview. “In fact, this growing trend paves the way for more and more business and cultural exchanges with south-east Asian countries.”“These young Taiwanese accumulating overseas experience and connections in the region will bring back key competitiveness to Taiwan in the long term,” said Mr Deng, who also serves as the head of Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations. “The government will do whatever it can to help Taiwanese companies relocate from China to Taiwan if necessary. We can also help those companies should they hope to go to invest in south-east Asian countries.”Mr Sun, the economist at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said the government should also take steps to attract talent from south-east Asia. Moves, he said, could include the changing of laws to allow college students to stay and work in Taiwan.But most of all, the shift to south-east Asia seems to be boosting the long-term prospects of the young people moving there.“Several of our managers for these emerging markets are under 30,” Mike Yang, general manager of Advantech’s emerging markets business, told Nikkei. “It’s really a great place that is growing rapidly and it’s definitely better than working in some mature markets where you are only a cog in a big machine.”Ms Wu, the 29-year-old team leader at the footwear company, said she was thrown in at the deep end on her first day working in Vietnam.“All of us were asked to be a leader to handle various tasks at the very beginning,” she said. “It’s stressful, but it also makes you grow quicker and become more competitive.”A version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on October 1, 2018 . ©2018 Nikkei Inc.

35;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-10-05T17:18:23Z;Nike expresses concern over Ronaldo rape claim;Sponsors issue statements after allegation against football star;Pressure is building on Cristiano Ronaldo after a rape allegation made against him became public, leading to key sponsors expressing their concern and the football star pulling out of upcoming matches for the Portuguese national team.Earlier this week, police in Nevada reopened a criminal investigation over a complaint made by a local woman that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room nine years ago. He has vehemently denied the allegations.Lawyers for the woman, Kathryn Mayorga, held a press conference on Wednesday to confirm an earlier report by German magazine Der Spiegel, suggesting she had first made the accusation to police in June 2009, but had remained silent after receiving $375,000 in an out-of-court settlement.Ms Mayorga’s lawyers suggested the deal was invalid for a number of reasons, including that such settlements are not allowed to conceal a criminal act.Nike and Electronic Arts, two of the player’s sponsors, took the rare step of issuing statements of disquiet over the matter, but have maintained their commercial links.Nike said: “We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”Reports suggest that Ronaldo is one of the few athletes to have a lifetime deal with Nike, alongside the likes of basketball players Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Sponsors often include morality clauses in their contracts, allowing them to end deals if a sportsperson’s personal conduct proves damaging.Ronaldo is the cover star of Fifa football, one of the world’s bestselling video games. Its maker, Electronic Arts, said it was “closely monitoring the situation”, adding that athletes it endorsed were expected to “conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA’s values”.Ronaldo has many personal sponsorship deals, including with watchmaker Tag Heuer and Cairo-based metals group Egyptian Steel. Through his personal brand “CR7”, he has launched a line of fragrances, footwear, luxury underwear and blankets. His personal sponsorship deals were worth $47m in the year to June 2018, according to Forbes.Fernando Santos, Portugal’s head coach, expressed support for the player, but added that following conversations with Ronaldo, he would not represent his national side again until next year.In July, he signed for Italian club Juventus, which paid a €100m transfer fee to Spain’s Real Madrid, while giving the footballer a four-year contract that provides a salary worth more than €50m a year after tax.Juventus signed Ronaldo in the belief that his international profile will help the club secure global sponsorship deals that could help transform it into the world’s richest club.In a statement on Twitter, Juventus said: “Cristiano Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus.“The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.”Juventus’s share price has fallen close to 19 per cent over the course of the week.Ronaldo said in a statement on Twitter: “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.“My clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.”
36;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-25T21:30:56Z;Nike delivers earnings beat ahead of Kaepernick furore;;Nike reported revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street forecasts in its first quarter thanks to continued sales momentum in its key market of North America and as efforts to boost its digital capabilities paid off.The results, which cover the three-month period to the end of August, exclude any effects from the sportswear maker’s decision earlier this month to use Colin Kaepernick — the former National Football League player who divided national opinion by kneeling during the US national anthem to protest police brutality against African Americans — as the face of its latest advertising campaign celebrating the 30th anniversary of the ‘Just do it’ slogan.“We know it has resonated quite strongly with consumers here in North America and around the world,” Mark Chapman, chief executive, said of the anniversary campaign on a call with analysts that made no direct mention of Mr Kaepernick.Oregon-based Nike said after closing bell on Tuesday that revenue rose 10 per cent year-on-year in the three months ended August 31 to $9.95bn, and about $120m ahead of the median forecast in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Revenues in North America, which account for about 42 per cent of global sales, were up 6 per cent from a year ago to $4.15bn. The company faced stagnating sales in the US for most of fiscal 2018. Sales in Greater China grew 24 per cent to $1.38bn, a shade higher than the 23 per cent pace the market was looking for.Net profit rose 15 per cent from a year ago to $1.09bn, or 67 cents a diluted share, and higher than Wall Street’s forecast for earnings of 63 cents a share. Gross margin of 44.2 per cent was a whisker under market estimates of 44.256 per cent.“We are delivering stronger global growth and profitability than we anticipated entering this fiscal year,” Andy Campion, chief financial officer, said.Mr Parker said: “Our expanded digital capabilities are accelerating our complete portfolio and creating value across all dimensions as we connect with and serve consumers.”Management said they would stick with full-year guidance for constant currency revenue growth in the high-single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range. Gross margin is expected to expand more strongly in the second half of fiscal 2019 compared to the first half.The company also noted “global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics” that had resulted in a stronger US dollar over the past 90 days.Nike’s move to use Colin Kaepernick, a former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, in its campaign drew both praise and customer backlash, including the ire of US President Donald Trump. After a brief dip following the ad’s reveal on September 3, Nike shares chalk up a series of record highs and an additional $5bn in market capitalisation in the subsequent weeks.The Kaepernick ad was revealed at the start of the company’s current quarter, meaning today’s results do not reflect any impacts from possible customer boycotts or, conversely, increased demand for the goods of a company perceived to be “woke”.Nike shares were down 3.9 per cent in after-hours trade on Tuesday at $81.50, a level slightly lower than before the Kaepernick ad was released. Shares closed at a record $85.55 on September 21.
37;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-13T10:32:51Z;Nike, Kaepernick and the power of voting with the wallet;Why social justice is good for business;"Why did I find myself in Nike’s multistorey flagship store in New York last weekend? Was it a) because I had just seen the new advertising campaign announcing the US quarterback-turned-equality-activist Colin Kaepernick as its spokesman under the slogan “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything”? Or was it b) because I had just watched Serena Williams serving a volley of fury at the umpire during the closing stages of the US Open women’s final, wearing an off-shoulder tennis dress with tutu skirt designed by Off-White’s Virgil Abloh in collaboration with the sportswear brand? Or was it c) I was soaking wet, and needed a lightweight waterproof that didn’t cost the Earth?I think the answer is probably a combination of the three. Although I hadn’t actually seen the campaign picture of Kaepernick at the point I walked into the store, I had already seen plenty of news about its controversial fallout. Kaepernick became the face of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2016 when he knelt during a performance of the national anthem at a pre-season NFL game to protest against racial injustice. The decision to use the sports star as a spokesman has sparked calls for a boycott by Trump supporters.The Greatest Showman school may have argued there is no such thing as bad publicity. But Phineas T Barnum lived in a world before social media recalibrated the scales of social justice and turned brands into quivering scaredy-cats fearful of creating media “storms”. At a time when marketing is hyper-responsive to cultural sensitivities, trigger warnings and the potential for causing offence, Nike’s ad strategy has been boldly counter-intuitive. Rather than try to please everyone and be inclusive (the buzzword of the day), they have decided to cut off a client-base entirely. Few exchanges have been as inflammatory as those in which Nike fans tweeted potential boycotters with the hashtags “#justdoit” and “#bye”.Yet, despite the divisive politics, the strategy is working. In the days since the campaign launch, Nike has declared a 31 per cent bump in online sales. And the share price, following a minor dip, has rallied.Phil Oh, the New York fashion street photographer with whom I have spent much of this week prancing around, topped up his Nike shares when the stock price fell last week. He has since watched them bounce back to good health. “It proves that social justice is good for business,” he said as we waited for yet another show to start. “And what could be better than to make money out of racists?”Well, quite. But for most other brands it’s not as easy as that. Speaking informally over dinner last year, a British-based designer decried the fact that his eveningwear was beloved by red-state voters who were in favour of the death penalty, but conceded that his business would go bust without them. And when Virgil Abloh staged his first menswear Louis Vuitton show in Paris in June, his egalitarian sympathies were only found in the subtlest of details — a Wizard of Oz motif on a sweater that might have been a political reference; a rainbow-coloured catwalk that could have championed equal rights. Insinuations were made, but nothing was explicit.By the same token, when Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first female designer to be made head of design at Dior, opened her first show with a “We should all be feminists” T-shirt, she found herself having to reconcile equal-opportunity ideals with astronomic price points that were far out with the reach of normal womankind.Pepsi’s “woke” Kendall Jenner campaign, in which the brand also tried to ally with the Black Lives Matter movement, was a catastrophic fail and the ad was later pulled because it seemed so ingenuous. If Nike’s effort feels more authentic, it’s probably because it is. Yes, the company has faced criticism about its labour practices, and its co-founder, Phil Knight, is a big Republican donor. But Nike has been active in responding to calls for more transparency since the early 1990s. Moreover, the brand is legitimately part of the culture of the athletes with whom it works. It represents them and thus their point of view. And so, when Serena Williams gets impassioned about gender discrimination while wearing the most flamboyant tennis dress ever seen on a court, Nike needs to take a stand as well.Nike is not alone in putting its money where its mouth is. Just down from the Nike store I stopped outside Patagonia, the California-based outdoor clothing specialists founded by the environmentalist Yvon Chouinard. A poster on its door reads: “When the polls open, we close.” US stores of the brand will close on November 8 in order to allow their staff to vote.Just like Nike, Patagonia is hoping to sit “on the right side of history”. Last year, in the wake of Trump’s request to review the protected status of 27 of America’s national monuments, the company invested $700,000 in a first-ever TV campaign, a minute-long advertisement discussing the need to safeguard public lands. It also recorded a record $1bn in revenues. To which I contributed the price of a T-shirt. It felt like a good investment.Like many people reading this, I don’t have a vote in the upcoming US midterms. I have to sit, and wait and watch. Such impotence makes me sad. At least I have a new rain jacket. Suffice to say, I’ll be needing no encouragement at all to vote with my wallet.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Jo’s articles are published, just click the button “add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page beside the author’s name.

38;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Nike shares erase losses from Kaepernick ad fallout;;Just did it.Nike shares on Monday reclaimed the level they were at before investors dumped the sportswear maker for its decision to use Colin Kaepernick, the former football quarterback who sparked national debate for deciding to ‘take a knee’ during the US national anthem, as the face of its latest ad campaign.Mr Kaepernick took his course of action to draw attention to police brutality against African-Americans. While it inspired sporting peers to act similarly, it was seen by some fans, team owners and President Donald Trump as being unpatriotic.Nike revealed the ad campaign on September 3, the Labour Day public holiday, and was met with a mix of praise and protest, with some consumers burning their Nike shoes or vowing to boycott the brand.The following day, when markets opened after the long weekend, Nike shares dropped 3.2 per cent.Today, shares were up 2.4 per cent to $82.24 in afternoon trade, higher than the pre-ad announcement closing level of $82.20, and leaving them 31.5 per cent higher in 2018 to date.Nike’s share price is 0.9 per cent below its record close of $82.95 on August 21.
39;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-07T19:06:05Z;Corporate week in review, September 8;"Amazon breaks $1tn; Nike, US shale, Twitter and WPP";A round-up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Amazon broke through the $1tn market capitalisation level this week, capping an extraordinary surge in which the ecommerce group’s stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months.Although it fell back from the mark in subsequent trading, the group joined exclusive company: Apple was the first to break the barrier last month. “I’ve made billions of dollars of failures,” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, now the world’s richest person, said in 2014.“Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn’t work,” said Mr Bezos, who founded the group in his garage in Washington state in 1994.Nike was confronted with a consumer backlash, a sell-off in its shares and an attack from Donald Trump, the US president, after the sportswear maker launched an ad campaign featuring the controversial American footballer Colin Kaepernick.Mr Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before games in a protest over police brutality. He is now an unsigned free agent.The company is the official clothing sponsor of the NFL, and some fans quickly took to social media to vent their anger by destroying Nike shoes and threatening to boycott the brand. Marketing experts defended the move, saying consumers increasingly wanted companies to take a stand on social issues.Shares in WPP, the world’s largest advertising group fell as much as 8 per cent on Tuesday after it lowered its profit margin guidance for the year.Mark Read, the new chief executive, promised a strategic review of the company, which was rocked by the acrimonious departure of its founder and former chief executive Martin Sorrell earlier this year.Shareholders must wait until the year-end for the results of the review. Ian Whittaker of stockbroker Liberum said WPP was likely to sell “at least significant parts of” its market research business Kantar.In written testimony published before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, defended the social media platform’s political neutrality after Mr Trump accused it of “shadow-banning” rightwing voices.The hearings come amid increasing scrutiny on social media companies ahead of the midterm elections, both in terms of what they are doing to address foreign efforts to influence American voters and how they treat different political voices on their platforms. Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice-chair of the committee, warned: “The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end”.The US shale oil industry is slowing as logistical challenges including labour costs and a lack of adequate pipeline capacity pile up, the chief executives of some of the largest production and oilfield services companies warned this week.Jeff Miller, chief executive of Halliburton, spoke of a “decrease in customer urgency” that had put pressure on the prices the company could charge in parts of the US.He said the slowdown would cut 8-10 cents from Halliburton’s third-quarter earnings per share, which had been expected to be about 52 cents.
40;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-07T13:07:52Z;Nike picks a side in America’s culture wars;The trainer brand courts controversy with its Kaepernick ‘believe in something’ advert;"Nike’s “Just do it” slogan first aired in 1988, at the end of a 30-second television advert that featured an 80-year-old long-distance runner jogging cheerfully across the Golden Gate Bridge. The sun shone, forgettable music plinked and nobody was remotely offended.This week, to celebrate the anniversary of that trademark, Nike tweeted a black-and-white picture of another athlete. Colin Kaepernick, the former American football quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, stared into the camera with the words, “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” across his face. Everybody went nuts. Kaepernick is well known for kneeling during the national anthem at the start of National Football League games, to draw attention to police brutality against African-Americans. His protest has been widely copied by peers in a sport where most players are black, and has split the country about the most American of sports.To supporters, Kaepernick is showing respect for the victims of racial injustice; to critics, he is showing disrespect for the US anthem, its flag and its troops, who — as Fox News commentators said — have a stronger claim to have made sacrifices. With a narrow majority of Americans telling pollsters that anthem protests are inappropriate and the NFL almost as polarising a brand as Fox or its cable news rival MSNBC, this sounds like the worst kind of debate for a brand to stumble into.The backlash was swift. Sneakers were burnt, boycotts were threatened, Nike brand’s favourability plunged in surveys, and the company lost 3.2 per cent of its $130bn market value in a day.“Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way?” tweeted President Donald Trump.Yes, Nike surely knew, because the reaction followed a predictable arc for the social media age: a provocative move by a brand sparks hashtagged denunciations from one side, and effusive praise on the other. Misinformation and memes follow. Even the kicker of a disapproving presidential tweet was easy to foresee as Mr Trump’s disdain for NFL protesters and use of the issue to fire up his voters are well known. So why risk it?Nike has good reasons to believe its gamble will pay off. First, it is reacting to a media environment where little of the advertising wisdom of 1988 still applies. An amiable octogenarian is nobody’s idea of an influencer, while Kaepernick has 6m followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.Nike has understood the power of celebrities since it signed Michael Jordan in 1984, but their influence is now amplified by social media — and by controversy. By Apex Marketing’s calculation, Nike generated exposure worth more than $163m even before its television version of the Kaepernick ad aired on Thursday during the NFL season’s opening game.Nike needs the attention because Adidas has been nipping at its Jordans since the German group introduced its Yeezy line with Kanye West in 2015. Nike’s North American sales fell 2 per cent last year, and Adidas has made inroads with the market’s most influential buyers.Josh Luber, founder of StockX, a marketplace where fans trade coveted shoes for up to five-figure sums, says Nike’s share of the resale market has fallen from 96 per cent to 70 per cent since the Yeezy brand launched. Those core “sneakerhead” customers are notably younger, more urban and more ethnically diverse than the wider population, notes Eunkyu Lee, a professor of marketing at Syracuse University.This is Nike’s second reason to be confident: drill down into this week’s polls and they show that support for Nike and Kaepernick is strongest among millennial or Gen-Z, African-American, liberal urbanites — the group Nike targets. The company’s biggest risk is becoming “mainstream, the usual, everywhere, tamed”, Prof Lee says. Courting controversy forces its most dedicated fans to defend it and catches the eye of more neutral consumers.Finally, Nike will have been encouraged by studies showing that consumers reward brands for speaking up on divisive social issues. But it is doing something more novel and calculated than other multinationals that have weighed in on immigration, gun control or race: it did not stumble into this controversy; it sought it.A polarised populace is a fact of life for brands, in the US and beyond. That leaves them with a choice: try to carry on catering to a vanishing mass-market middle ground, or stake out a position that will infuriate one side but excite the other. The latter strategy has worked for politicians such as Mr Trump. Unlike elected officials, a brand can win with far less than 50.1 per cent of the population behind it.

Shares ended 3.2 per cent lower on Tuesday when markets reopened after the holiday weekend, but were little changed after Mr Trump’s outburst on Twitter.The US president wrote on Wednesday morning: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”Late on Tuesday, Mr Trump told the conservative news and opinion site The Daily Caller he thought Nike’s move “was a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent.”Mr Kaepernick chose to first sit, then “take a knee” during the playing of the US national anthem to protest police violence against African-Americans. While his actions inspired other players to make similar gestures, they were also regarded by some fans, team owners and Mr Trump as unpatriotic.Nike shares were up 0.7 per cent at pixel time on Wednesday morning, still down from Tuesday’s slide, but higher than they were before Mr Trump’s tweet. The stock is down 3.4 per cent from its late August record high close.
42;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-04T23:19:04Z;Nike rolls the dice on polarising NFL figure and social activist;Shares fall on Kaepernick ad but observers confident group is doing ‘the right thing’;"Nike was confronted with a consumer backlash, a sell-off in its shares and an attack from Donald Trump after the sportswear maker launched an ad campaign featuring an American footballer who refused to stand for the national anthem.Customers angry about Nike’s decision to use Colin Kaepernick in a new promotion posted videos of themselves burning trainers, while calls to boycott the brand spread on social media.President Trump also weighed in on the row, telling the conservative news and opinion site The Daily Caller: “I think it’s a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent.”The reaction highlighted the dilemma facing US companies in how to position their brands at a time when consumers increasingly expect them to take a stand on divisive social and political issues.Wall Street expressed concern about the potential financial fallout for Nike, sending shares in the S&P 500 company down 3.2 per cent on Tuesday.Several branding experts, however, said that the backlash would be shortlived and the move could pay off for Nike in the long run.“They’re sophisticated marketers and know their customers well. Consumers will reward them,” said Carreen Winters, chief strategy officer of MWWPR, a brand reputation and crisis management firm.By 9.30am New York time, Apex Marketing Group calculated that Nike had already received exposure worth $43m across television, radio, online news and social media, of which less than $11m was negative.Mr Kaepernick has become among the most polarising figures in the country over his decision to first sit, and then take a knee, during the playing of the US anthem before NFL games.The move inspired hundreds of players to make similar gestures to protest police violence against African-Americans. However, the high-profile protests incurred the wrath of Mr Trump and was criticised as unpatriotic by some fans and team owners.[Nike] wanted to do the right thingNike has a long record for showing signs of edginess in its branding, for instance the basketball player Charles Barkley’s “I am not a role model” campaign of 1993. It has also tended to back sports stars embroiled in controversy. It stuck with Tiger Woods when the golfer was going through a scandal in his private life, and Maria Sharapova after the tennis player was suspended for testing positive for a prohibited drug.Now the company is featuring Mr Kaepernick in a campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the sportswear company’s “Just do it” slogan.A close-up of the quarterback — who is suing team owners for allegedly colluding to keep him off the field — is overlaid with the text “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything”.While he was critical of the company, Mr Trump indicated he was supportive of its right to take such decisions. “It is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things,” he said. “I personally am on a different side.”Nike “obviously knew what they were doing — their intention was to push the envelope”, said Chris Allieri, founder of public relations group Mulberry and Astor. “But they also wanted to do the right thing.”The decision would be a “moment of reckoning for other brands”, he added. “This may inspire them to take risks in their advertising and marketing.”Recent studies have shown that consumers in the US and elsewhere increasingly expect business to express its views on social and political debates, and in some cases trust companies more than governments.However, the studies have also shown that consumers have become almost as polarised about brands as voters are about political parties.One recent survey by Morning Consult, a research firm, found that consumers saw little controversy in brands speaking up about civil rights, criminal justice reform or LGBTQ rights.Yet the right of protesters to kneel during the national anthem was one of the least popular political stances a business could support, alongside stricter policies preventing abortion.The survey also ranked the NFL as America’s sixth most polarising brand, with strong support from Democrats but a negative image in the eyes of Republicans, among whom it is as unpopular as CNN, a frequent target of Mr Trump’s tweets.A separate poll by Quinnipiac in June found 82 per cent of Democrats thought NFL players had the right to protest, but 81 per cent of Republicans thought they did not.Mr Kaepernick played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons but has not been signed by a team since he became a free agent in March 2017.Milwaukee, 1987; adopted and raised in CaliforniaUniversity of Nevada-Reno; BA in business management; two-time conference player of the year at quarterback2011

43;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-04T17:38:21Z;Nike/Colin Kaepernick: radical chic;Group’s risk in aligning with the protesting quarterback is limited;Colin Kaepernick took a big risk. Nike’s risk in backing him is less onerous.On Monday, the former National Football League quarterback revealed that the US sportswear group would feature him in ads marking the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan. Kaepernick is now better known for protest than sporting prowess: kneeling during the national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign.Toxic to NFL franchisees, he has not played in the league for nearly two years. Nike faces protests of its own for backing him. The world’s largest sporting brand has the financial muscle to ride it out without any serious loss of earnings.Nike shares are just off all-time highs with its enterprise value at $130bn. Its North American business had been declining for some time. Some of its shoe releases have been flat footed and its retail distributors are fighting online disruption. But in its latest quarter, North American sales flipped to positive, growing 3 per cent.Direct sales and a partnership with Amazon are helping Nike defeat the shopping mall malaise. It forecasts that the proportion of revenue from digital sales will double in the next five years to about a third. Investors are enthusiastic. They have pushed Nike’s forward earnings multiple to about 30 times.Ultimately, Nike is a global company focused on basketball, one of the most global games. Only about 40 per cent of its revenue comes from saturated North America. Its growth engine is China. There, revenue jumped a fifth in the year just ended in June.Nike’s biggest athletes remain Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. American football stars have never been a driver of athletic shoes or clothing. Yet Kaepernick is most popular among young Americans who are Nike’s core customers. Hiring him is an easy commercial call. If Nike wanted to take the same kind of bold move the quarterback did — one that damaged future earnings — the company would sign up a Chinese dissident instead.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

44;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-04T14:35:25Z;Nike drops after signing ‘taking a knee’ quarterback Kaepernick;;Nike shares are down in morning trade as investors reacted to news that the sportswear company had made Colin Kaepernick — the National Football League quarterback who kicked off a protest movement over policy brutality by kneeling during the US national anthem — a face of its latest advertising campaign.The Oregon-based company is the official clothing sponsor of the NFL, and some angry football fans quickly took to social media to vent their frustration at the signing, which was revealed on Monday, by destroying Nike shoes and other kit and threatening to boycott the brand.The ad features a close-up of Mr Kaepernick’s face, overlaid with the words “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” It drew praise from others, such as LeBron James, the basketball superstar who also features in the Nike ad campaign.Mr Kaepernick was thrust into the spotlight in 2016 when, as the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, he chose to first sit, then “take a knee”, rather than stand during the national anthem. While that inspired hundreds of other players to take similar action in protest of social inequality and police violence against unarmed black people, it drew howls of protest from some NFL fans and team owners and added to debate around America’s divided social and political climate.Mr Kaepernick has not been signed by a team since becoming a free agent in March 2017. He has sued team owners for allegedly colluding to keep him off the field in reaction to his protests.Nike shares were down 2.3 per cent in morning trade at $80.29, but had been down as much as 3.9 per cent. It was the first time investors were able to trade the stock since Friday, owing to the holiday weekend. Nike’s share price closed at a record $82.95 on August 21 and is up 28.4 per cent in 2018.Mr Kaepernick’s stance inspired hundreds of other players to take similar action by kneeling, locking arms or raising their firsts in protest at social inequality and police violence against unarmed black people.The NFL anthem protest has simmered for months and drawn other companies into the controversy. The founder of Papa John’s, the NFL’s official pizza sponsor, blamed the players’ protests as a reason for a drop in sales, a move that ultimately led to the company being dropped as an NFL sponsor.
45;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Colin Kaepernick is a shrewd choice for Nike’s new campaign;The NFL quarterback who protested against racism is an overtly political figurehead;Nike’s decision to make the American football player Colin Kaepernick one of the faces of its 30th anniversary “Just do it” campaign is a bold, overtly political move but also a shrewd — and consistent — commercial calculation.The quarterback became the emblem of a protest against US police brutality and racial injustice when, in 2016, he knelt during the national anthem before National Football League games. His protest, subsequently picked up by other players, put him at odds with many NFL fans, team owners and US president Donald Trump.Nike has not commented in detail on its decision to feature Kaepernick, whom it has sponsored since 2011. But this is already a branding landmark because the player, currently a free agent, will benefit from sponsorship and publicity even though he may never be signed again to play the sport for which he became known. One US sports reporter tweeted that Kaepernick will have his own line of shoes, shirts and jerseys.Looked at through a wider lens, Nike is simply being consistent. Last September, it issued a statement in support of the player protests, backing athletes’ right to “freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society”.The group also has a habit of sticking with players who are facing controversy. It did eventually sever links with cyclist Lance Armstrong for misleading the group about his use of banned drugs. But it continued to back Maria Sharapova, the tennis player, as she served a ban for testing positive for a prohibited drug two years ago — she apologised for unintentionally taking the drug — and supported golfer Tiger Woods through a period of injuries, a sex scandal, and a conviction for driving under the influence of drugs.Kaepernick’s stand on a point of principle is quite different, and Nike’s decision is in some ways easier than whether to endorse a star facing disgrace. Even so, Nike can expect a rough reaction from some of its customers. Twitter is already alight with video of NFL fans burning Nike shoes and kit and calling for a wider boycott on the company. All this even before Mr Trump has had his inevitable tilt at the company on social media.Research has shown that “high blame” incidents damage celebrity brands, while low-blame events (injury being the obvious example) may encourage sympathy. For some, Kaepernick’s stand will represent a high-blame incident. Still, the commercial odds are stacked in Nike’s favour. In March, it extended its contract to supply NFL teams with game-day kit to 2028, by which point Mr Trump will be at least four years out of the White House. The group, which has been seeking opportunities to increase US sales growth, must also assume that the Just Do It campaign will open a market for Kaepernick kit to a much wider group of shoppers who do not even follow football. Far from blaming the player, they credit him with “taking the knee” for a wider principle.The slogan super-imposed on the close-up of the player’s face in the new Nike advertisement reads: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” One thing is certain: that is not a sacrifice that Nike expects to make.
46;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-09-03T23:22:16Z;Nike makes ‘taking a knee’ quarterback face of its ad campaign;NFL’s clothing partner decides to use Colin Kaepernick despite Trump criticism of protest;"Nike, a major National Football League sponsor, has made Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who catalysed a protest movement over police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem, a face of its latest advertising campaign.The move by the NFL’s official clothing partner comes as Mr Kaepernick is suing team owners for allegedly colluding to keep him off the field following his 2016 protests.Last week an arbitrator denied the NFL’s request to dismiss the case, allowing it to move forward to a hearing.Mr Kaepernick shared his new Nike ad on Twitter on Monday: a close-up of his face, overlaid with the words “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything”.The campaign marks the 30th anniversary of the sportswear company’s “Just do it” slogan and will also feature Serena Williams, LeBron James and other Nike-endorsed athletes.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s vice-president of brand for North America, told ESPN: “We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward.”Nike first signed an endorsement deal with Mr Kaepernick in 2011, said a spokeswoman for the company.The NFL did not respond to a request for comment.Mr Kaepernick, who played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons and led them to an unsuccessful Super Bowl bid in 2012, has not been signed by a team since becoming a free agent in March 2017.He has blamed NFL owners for keeping him out of a job in retribution for the protests, even as they have brought on less talented players.Mr Kaepernick’s decision to first sit, and then take a knee, during the playing of the US anthem before NFL games ultimately inspired hundreds of players to kneel, lock arms or raise their fists in protest at social inequality and police violence against unarmed black people.The protests drew opprobrium from some NFL fans, enraged many team owners and became another battleground in America’s divided political landscape.Milwaukee, 1987; adopted and raised in CaliforniaUniversity of Nevada-Reno; BA in business management; two-time conference player of the year at quarterback2011

Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award, 2018President Donald Trump has called for the protesting players to be fired for what he sees as disrespecting America’s flag and troops and has repeatedly returned to the anthem controversy as a theme in his speeches and rallies.After the protests dominated much of the past two seasons, during which the league suffered declining television viewership, the NFL announced a new policy for the national anthem in May.Players would no longer be required to be on the field while the anthem is played, but if they did not stand, the league could fine teams and the teams could discipline players.However, that policy was put on hold this summer amid discussions with the NFL players’ union, which has backed players’ right to protest.Whatever is decided by the time the season kicks off on Thursday night, television viewers may miss it entirely. ESPN and CBS, which both hold rights to air NFL games, have said they would not broadcast the anthem during their coverage."
47;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-07-20T06:36:14Z;China’s factories eye south-east Asia to avoid US tariff threat;Risk of wider trade war prompts some manufacturers to accelerate diversification;Manufacturers in China are considering moving production to Vietnam and other lower-cost countries in south-east Asia as they fear being swept up in the widening trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.The Trump administration has already imposed or announced 25 per cent tariffs on $50bn of high-technology products and industrial machinery and is proposing to implement 10 per cent tariffs on a further $200bn of Chinese exports, including some consumer goods such as furniture.Factory owners in the manufacturing heartland of Guangdong province say existing tariffs and uncertainty about future US trade measures are prompting them to accelerate plans to diversify production beyond China, where wages have increased rapidly over the past decade.“We don’t think the trade war is a short-term crisis,” said Joe Chau, who runs a baby garment factory in Guangdong and is the president of the small- and medium-sized business division at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. “We have to analyse which Asian countries are good for our customers . . . to offset the China risk.”Although clothing, and many other consumer goods including toys, have not yet been hit by tariffs, Mr Chau said that US retailers and their suppliers in China need to work on contingency plans ahead of the traditional autumn buying season because “nobody can predict what Donald Trump will do”.Jimmy Kwok, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, another lobby group, said that while the shift from China to south-east Asia was already under way for products such as electronics, trade tensions were pushing companies to re-examine their supply chains.But manufacturing executives said that shifting production out of China would take several years of planning, running the risk that the US-China trade dispute would be resolved or that the Trump administration would extend tariffs to countries such as Vietnam precisely to stop this sort of “tariff-jumping”.Chiu Chi-hong, who owns a toy factory in Guangdong that supplies Disney and Mattel, said that even though toys were not on the tariff lists yet, his exports had been held up by “extreme test requirements” by US customs since the start of the year.Along with 30 other manufacturers, he is going to Myanmar in September to examine the possibility of moving production there to protect himself from further US trade restrictions on Chinese exports. But he fears that the policy might change again.“Trump and Xi [Jinping] might become friends again,” he said, referring to the presidents of the US and China. “We’re only a mid-sized company. We can’t handle factories in two places at the same time.”Angelo Cheung, a Hong Kong-based executive for Aoyagi, a Japanese electronics group that manufactures in China, said some orders from the US had already been halted because of the heightened uncertainty.“We are now in the middle of a crossroads,” said Mr Cheung, whose company is considering various options, including moving part of its supply chain to Vietnam. “But they are all only mid-to-long-term solutions.”Jon Cowley, a trade expert at law firm Baker & McKenzie in Hong Kong and a former Nike executive, said that it was “expensive and complicated” to open factories in new jurisdictions.Factories exporting to the US have to meet a wide range of environmental, labour and quality standards and it takes time to ensure that production facilities in new countries are up to scratch.A further challenge is the need to meet fast-changing consumer tastes, where existing Chinese factories often have the edge because of their decades of experience and long-term relationships with US retailers.Mr Cowley said that while they were in a tight squeeze, factory owners would not rush to move production. But if they were already considering diversification, for example to take advantage of the far lower wages in countries such as Vietnam, “this may be enough to push them over the finishing line”.
48;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-07-06T04:02:54Z;Federer’s Uniqlo deal underscores value of legendary status;Brands spend big to net associations with sports’ superstars, even in retirement;As Roger Federer stepped on to Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships this week, scores of fans in the crowd wore hats and shirts emblazoned with the “RF” logo, his personal clothing line made by Nike.Yet, as the champion began the defence of his Grand Slam title, Federer wore apparel made by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo, in effect ending his 24-year association with the US sportswear maker. Federer, it emerged, has signed one of the most lucrative sports sponsorship deals in history, with Uniqlo paying roughly $300m over 10 years for the tie-up. Aged 36, he is unlikely to continue playing professionally until the end of the deal, but has obtained a rare clause that allows him to keep the money regardless of whether he is competing.Sports broadcaster ESPN first reported the details of Federer’s contract, with one person familiar with the deal confirming them. Uniqlo, Nike and representatives for Federer declined to discuss the negotiations.Speaking at Wimbledon, Federer said he was “excited” about wearing the Japanese brand for the first time. “I must tell you, it's been a long time coming,” he said. “I felt very good out there.”Analysts say Federer, who has enjoyed a stellar career having won more Grand Slam titles (20) than any man in history, is one of a select group of globally renowned athletes. He is in line to earn just as much, if not more, from corporate endorsements after he sets down his racket for good.“There are a small number of athletes that can do this,” said Nigel Currie, founder of sports consultancy NC Partnership. “It’s all about being a legend in a particular sport so their name is never really going to go away. Federer is in that league. He is a huge legend in the sport and his name will live on for a very long time.”Others in this elite category include LeBron James, the US basketball star, who this week signed a four-year contract worth $154m to join the Los Angeles Lakers from next season. However, he already has a lifetime sponsorship deal with Nike worth over $1bn, according to comments attributed to his agent.With its deal with James, Nike hopes to replicate the off-court merchandising success it had with former NBA star Michael Jordan. Continued sales of the “Jordan” line of Nike trainers has helped him gain a personal net worth of $1.65bn in 2018, up $350m from a year earlier, according to the Forbes annual rankings of the world’s richest athletes.Golfer Tiger Woods has earned $43.3m this year from endorsements by groups including Nike and watchmaker Rolex, compared with just $1.3m in prize money from competing in tournaments. Aged 42, it has been a decade since Woods has won a Major title, but his earlier record of 14 Major championship victories has allowed him to stay attractive to sponsors long after the best years of his playing career.Meanwhile, sprinter Usain Bolt retired in 2017 and was still able to earn $30m this year thanks to continued sponsorship contracts with groups including sportswear group Puma, drinks brand Gatorade and watchmaker Hublot.Mr Currie said corporate groups typically sponsor athletes so that their brand is seen by large audiences, in effect using sportspeople as billboards. But a tiny cadre of superstars, able to stay in the public consciousness after the end of their careers, are desired as companies believe they can generate sales long after retirement. “The benefits are much more about awareness and exposure,” he said. “This is about seeing the brand name, but also selling millions and millions of shoes, shorts, kit and whatever else.”Fast Retailing, parent company of Uniqlo, said Federer was a “perfect ambassador” for the brand, insisting the deal was “more than just sports sponsorship”. “We are in the very early stages of discussing how best to align Roger’s personal humanitarian interests, strengths and availability with our community programmes,” it said.Still, long-term deals with athletes come with perils. In 2012, Nike terminated its contract with Lance Armstrong, with whom they developed the US cyclist’s “Live Strong” charitable foundation into a global brand, following revelations he had taken performance enhancing drugs during his seven Tour de France victories.Sponsors often include morality clauses in their contracts, allowing them to end deals if an sportsperson’s personal conduct proves damaging. Even so, Nike maintained its relationship with Woods, despite the reputational fallout from revelations of the golfer’s extra-marital affairs in 2009. Corporate groups disproportionately favour sponsorship deals with men. The world’s best paid female athlete is tennis player Serena Williams, who earned $19m in endorsements in 2017, adding to the $8m she earned in prize money last year. But she fell out of Forbes’s annual list of Top 100 earning athletes, following a pregnancy that prevented her from playing.Simply having a star on the books can add to a company’s value. On Thursday, shares in football club Juventus rose 9 per cent on rumours that footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was considering a transfer to the Italian league champions, with investors believing the Portuguese player would help market the club to fans around the world.Nike’s share price shed about 4 per cent this week, after the Swiss tennis champion ended his association with the US company.The tennis player offered Nike the chance to match Uniqlo’s offer, but it passed, according to a person familiar with the deal. Nike retains the trademark over the RF logo, but would not say whether it intended to keep the brand or how long it was assigned to the company. Federer said he intended to continue wearing Nike trainers for the time being, as Uniqlo does not manufacturer shoes, but wanted to gain the rights to the RF clothing line. “The RF logo is with Nike at the moment, but it will come to me at some point,” said Federer.“I hope sooner rather than later, that Nike can be nice and helpful in the process to bring it over to me. It’s also something that was very important for me, for the fans really. They are my initials. They are mine. The good thing is, it’s not theirs forever. In a short period of time, it will come to me.”The World Cup is a feast of football and is also usually a feast of sponsorship with international brands eager to cash in on the global attention and excitement the tournament generates, writes Matthew Garrahan.Not this year. A long-simmering corruption scandal that exploded in 2015 with a series of dawn raids on Fifa exposed a culture of kickbacks, bribes and criminality. The subsequent charges of several Fifa officials by US prosecutors caused many western brands to rethink their sponsorship of world football’s governing body and of its marquee event.The addition in 2015 by Fifa of a new sponsorship tier for international brands ended in failure when only a handful of companies signed up. Fifa also lost several big sponsors, including Sony and Emirates, when their deals ended at the end of the Brazil World Cup in 2014. They have been replaced by Qatar Airways, Russian energy company Gazprom and Dalian Wanda, the Chinese property and cinema group, but the net effect for Fifa has been three fewer sponsors at the Russia World Cup than it had in Brazil.This has had a corresponding impact on Fifa’s income, with sponsorship revenues for the organisation’s 2015-18 tournament cycle £179m lower than in the previous 2011-14 cycle.The omens for the next four years are similarly bleak unless Fifa takes drastic action, according to Tim Crow, a sports marketing adviser who has worked for a number of Fifa sponsors. “It’s a holding pattern at the moment and there isn’t much Fifa can do to grow revenues,” he said.Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup and negative sentiment around that tournament and the manner in which it won the vote, when bribes are alleged to have changed hands, will weigh on sponsors, he adds. “The bottom line is Fifa’s image . . . it’s seen as a body that will do anything for money and which is not about being for the good of the game.”This is not to say Fifa does not have opportunities to innovate. The introduction of video assistant referees in Russia has been a surprise hit with viewers and provides Fifa with a potentially new and lucrative stream of advertising revenue.World Cup matches have been paused for video assistant referee replays, when the team of assistant referees study controversial incidents. Now that VAR has been proven to be a success these moments could easily attract a title sponsor at future tournaments, said Mr Crow — much as they would in US sports, such as American football.“Fifa put VAR out to pitch [with sponsors] before the World Cup and no one wanted it,” he said. “But now that it’s been proven to work expect to see a sponsor go for it. It’s time in the game that you can’t ignore.”
49;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike aced as Federer dons new wardrobe from Uniqlo ;;In the cutthroat world of celebrity athlete endorsement, Nike has just been served the equivalent of an ace by Japanese fast-fashion retailer Uniqlo.Nike was among the biggest decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday as it surrendered some of last week’s strong share price gains and as investors digested news that tennis superstar Roger Federer has ended his longstanding relationship with it in favour of an apparel deal with Uniqlo reportedly worth more than $300m.Plenty of air had been pumped into Nike’s share price, which leapt 11.1 per cent on Friday to a record high after the Oregon-based group revealed sales in North America turned positive in its fiscal fourth quarter for the first time in a year and lifted its revenue growth guidance for 2019.Mr Federer had been a longtime Nike athlete, wearing the company’s shoes and clothing for more than two decades and through all of his record 20 grand slam singles titles.But, as defending champion, he commenced his campaign for a ninth Wimbledon singles crown on Monday sporting a Uniqlo stand-up collar shirt and shorts. Fast Retailing, the brand’s Japanese parent, said in a subsequent statement on Monday it had signed the tennis superstar as its newest global brand ambassador. The deal, worth more than $300m over 10 years, according to numerous media reports, would be among the most valuable athlete apparel deals ever signed and is a big step up from Mr Federer’s previous $120m over 10 years deal with Nike that expired on March 1 this year.Given Uniqlo is not a maker of sports shoes, the Swiss Maestro is still trampling the grass of the All England Club in his personalised pair of Nikes and is likely to remain in those kicks for the time being.Uniqlo is not best known for its sportswear offerings, but the signing of Mr Federer, arguably one of the most recognisable faces in global sport, could give the line a bigger boost than the company’s previous signings.In 2012, Uniqlo signed Novak Djokovic to a five-year deal soon after the Serb ascended to world number one. Kei Nishikori has long been a global brand ambassador, but his appeal is most pronounced in his home country of Japan.Tadashi Yanai, Uniqlo’s founder and chairman, said in a statement the partnership with Mr Federer would be about “innovation” on and off the court. “Uniqlo will help Mr. Federer continue taking tennis to new places, while exploring innovations in a number of areas including technology and design with him,” Mr Yanai added.The loss of Mr Federer may not be a huge problem for Nike, which still has plenty of talent in the tennis world to fall back upon. These include men’s world number one Rafael Nadal, Grand Slam queen Serena Williams and next-gen stars like Sloane Stephens and Nick Kyrgios.Although Mr Federer might be a big name in sport, tennis apparel and footwear is a “drop in the bucket” for Nike, said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones. The company’s bread and butter are things like running, basketball and football.With that in mind, investors will be keeping an eye on the decision by LeBron James to take his talents to . . . Los Angeles and join the city’s basketball team, the Lakers, in a four-year $154m contract.The move by Mr James, who is one of the few Nike athletes to have signed a lifetime contract with the sportswear maker thought to be worth more than $1bn, could give a boost to jersey and shoe sales as fans on the West Coast pick up new kit. For the past eight consecutive seasons, Mr James has led his various teams to the NBA finals, including a historic first title for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015-16 season.Nike last week reported revenue of $36.4bn in the 12 months to the May 31 and has a market cap of $128.4bn. Fast Retailing reported record revenue of ¥1.86tn ($16.8bn) in the 12 months to the end of August 2017 and has a market capitalisation of $45bn.

50;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-06-29T16:04:21Z;Nike shares race to record high, power Dow gains;;"Nike shares raced to a record high on Friday after the sportswear maker said sales in North America have turned positive and lifted its revenue growth guidance.Shares in the Oregon-based company jumped as much as 13 per cent to a record high of $81 before trimming their gains to trade 11 per cent higher. The advance left Nike shares tracking their best day since September 2014 and pushed their year-to-date advance to 28 per cent.Nike’s advance also helped power the share-price weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent higher.The company said after the market close on Thursday that sales in North America increased in its fiscal fourth quarter for the first time in four quarters. Nike also tightened its outlook and said it now expects high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2019, up from its previous projection of mid- to high-single digit growth.Following the results a handful of brokerages lifted their price target on the stock. Analysts at Credit Suisse raised theirs to $84 from $78 previously, while analysts at Deutsche Bank lifted theirs by $3 to $87.Despite investors cheering the results, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they remain neutral on the stock. “Keeping us on the sidelines are: (1) Higher-than-expected [selling, general & administrative] investments to drive growth, which we expect to persist and to limit earnings leverage; and (2) Already elevated valuation which embeds an acceleration in growth,” said Alexandra Walvis, analyst at Goldman. She lifted her price target on the stock to $81 from $78."
51;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-06-28T20:44:27Z;Nike shares sprint higher as N America sales turn positive;Sportswear maker also announces $15bn share buyback programme;US sportswear maker Nike on Thursday reported upbeat quarterly results with investors cheering a return to growth in North America and a new $15bn share repurchase programme.Shares in the Oregon-based company gained more than 5.5 per cent in extended trade after the company said its revenues increased 13 per cent from a year ago to $9.8bn in the fiscal fourth quarter, exceeding analyst expectations for $9.4bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Stripping out the impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up 8 per cent reflecting a 9 per cent increase in the Nike brand and a 14 per cent decline in its Converse brand.In North America, its largest market, sales grew three per cent on a constant currency basis — following three consecutive quarters of declines. Sales were up 10 per cent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, while jumping 25 per cent in greater China.The company also said its net income rose to $1.14bn or 69 cents a share, up from $1bn or 60 cents a share in the year ago quarter. That topped analysts’ estimates for earnings of 64 cents a share. The retailer said its profits were boosted by “strong global revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate”.“Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,” said chief executive Mark Parker. “Fuelled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for NIKE’s next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.”Nike’s sales in North America had tripped up as Adidas started gaining market share in the footwear market. But the company managed to lure customers back as it reset its Jordan sneaker line to include more colours and women’s sizes. Nike has also worked to grow its footwear sales overseas as it staves off competition from Adidas in the US. Earlier this year the company acquired data analytics firm Zodiac to gain better insight on consumer preferences.Nike on Thursday also announced a new four-year $15bn share buyback programme that will begin when the current programme is completed in fiscal 2019.Nike shares are up 15 per cent year-to-date at the end of the regular trading hours on Thursday.
52;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-06-15T11:14:06Z;Craig Green SS19 review: London’s finest takes to the world stage;At the Pitti fair in Florence, Craig Green steps up with colour, horror and a Nike collaboration;Craig Green put up his hand and grabbed a moth. It was gone 10pm, backstage after his majestic spring/summer 19 show at the Boboli garden in Florence, where Green is this season’s guest designer of the Pitti trade fair. Insects were flying into the spotlights. Green said when he was looking at the monitor backstage of the catwalk, all he could see was mosquitos, like a swarm about to attack the audience.It was apt, because, as Green said, “I love horror. It was that idea that the scariest thing you can think about is reality,” he said. The link was most clear in human outline wooden structures worn by some models that punctuated the collection. They looked like halos, or also crime scene chalk marks. “That idea of an angel. It also looked like someone following you.”The collection was a series of bangers, a flow of great ideas that sing from the rails of specialty retail. Simple white smock tops and wide pants were inspired by surgeons scrubs, with added sight lines of orange cord. Line-stitched cotton was dyed then acid washed to create an effect that Green said was “like static on a TV”. These also had fins of contrast colour lycra coming from the arms or joining the legs: “I thought it was nice that when they walked it looked like someone had cut them out on Photoshop and dragged them into the space.”Vivid colour panel knits were in collaboration with Nike, which had provided them with its Flyknit fabric usually found on sneakers. At the end, a series of distorted image tabards were actually three layers of fabric — football shirt jersey, nylon organza and mesh — that were digitally printed and then each layer slightly moved. Green said these were like a portal into another world.Such is the power of Green’s signature that all this free-range thinking can result in recognisable garments. The audience was studded with Craig Green super-fans wearing the same piece: a tropical beach zip-up patchwork jacket from his current SS18 collection. None of them seemed to care about the seeming faux-pas. There is pride in wearing Green’s designs.What struck most was the combinations of strong colour, particularly the Flyknits. “I watched a documentary where someone was talking about how when you put two colours together, they make your emotions feel something else,” said Green. “I like that when you put red on top of blue it looks like it’s vibrating. The line, you can’t focus on it.”Notice how much Green is talking about the individual’s connection with the garment. This is not about how you look to others. There’s no talk of the codes your garments send out, about what your wardrobe conveys about your place in society. Instead, it is the effect of the clothes on the wearer themselves. This intimacy is a rare state in fashion, and maybe goes to explain the kinship that Green’s customers feel with his designs.Green works in series of threes. This collection was the end of his current triptych. There are big decisions to be made. Should he return to the London catwalk? He said that showing in Florence had widened his audience, since only a limited number of stores attend London menswear. “There are buyers here who’ve bought the collection for four years but have never seen a show,” he said. But then Craig worn born in London, the city where he has now won British Menswear Designer of the Year twice in a row at the Fashion Awards. It was clear that he misses home.This collection was a step upwards in its confidence, ideas, audacity. It might also prove to be a turning point in Green’s career. Whatever happens, there’ll be a legion of admirers, all happy to be in the same space, wearing the same thing.
53;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-05-29T21:00:27Z;Increasingly wealthy Chinese go upmarket in consumer spending;Local businesses steal march on multinationals that fail to notice market shift;Chinese consumption has become so large that the country is the most important market for luxury and car companies — and is driving sales for global healthcare, entertainment and apparel brands.For decades the ruling Communist party’s encouragement of saving to fund domestic investment and the accumulation of foreign capital through export surpluses meant even as workers’ incomes rose, they struggled to afford goods that their country exported.By 2008, household consumption had fallen to 36 per cent of China’s total spending from 47 per cent in 2000. This compared with 70 per cent in the US, while disposable incomes averaged just $2,200 per year. As a result, multinationals drawn to China by the prospect of 1.3bn consumers often retreated disappointed.But since 2008, a tighter labour market boosting wages and capital gains from a housing price boom more than doubled average incomes, which reached $5,800 last year. Consumption has been the single biggest driver of growth since 2011, and household spending approaches 40 per cent of GDP.“It’s new households coming into the middle class stage which is driving consumption,” says Daniel Zipser of consultancy McKinsey. “The auto industry very much depends on China. The beauty and sports industries have a high share of their global business coming from China.”Rising affluence has been most visible in the automobile sector. China overtook the US as the world’s largest car market in 2009 and while the pace of growth has slowed, 29m vehicles were sold in China last year compared with 18m in the US.Volkswagen generated 41 per cent of its sales in China, while GM made 39 per cent and Ford 24 per cent in 2016, with profits generally an even higher proportion, according to consultancy Evercore.Chinese consumers became the world’s biggest spenders on luxury brands in 2012, according to consultancy Bain, and now account for around a third of global purchases — mostly by Chinese tourists overseas.But as price differences fall, luxury sales are returning to China with sales there accounting for a rising share of global luxury brands’ income — 27 per cent of sales last year for French group Kering, which owns brands such as Gucci, and 35 per cent for Swiss brand Swatch.Beyond luxury, China is now the world’s leading consumer of smartphones, while its movie and sportswear markets are second only to the US.That has driven sales for multinationals such as cinema group Imax which made a third of global revenues in China last year. China accounted for about 20 per cent of Apple and Adidas’ global sales, while Nike and Starbucks made about 10 per cent of global revenues in the country.China overtook Japan to become the world’s second largest drug market in 2013. Britain’s AstraZeneca made $3bn in China sales last year, about 13 per cent of its global total while the US’ Pfizer made 7 per cent of its revenues in China last year, trailing only the US and Japan.Chinese consumer market growth comes from premiumisationWhile there are headwinds to China’s consumer market such as rising personal debt, the risk of a housing bubble and slowing productivity growth, analysts are bullish on prospects for the next decade. Disposable incomes will expand by nearly 8 per cent a year through to 2020, according to brokerage CLSA, which predicts that the household savings rate will fall to 27 per cent.The number of affluent households with annual income over Rmb136,000 ($22,000) will nearly double from 82m in 2015 to 137mn in 2020, according to research group Gavekal.China’s consumer market is now firmly in a middle-class stage, where growth comes from selling higher-quality products. Volume sales of pork, beer and instant noodles have peaked in recent years. “China has already reached a good consumption level in terms of volume for all the food and beverage categories, so growth comes from premiumisation,” adds Mr Zipser.That should be good news for foreign brands, who sell more premium products. But in practice Chinese consumer brands have been faster to adapt to the upgrading trend than multinationals.In China’s urban fast moving consumer goods market, worth $190bn, Chinese companies’ sales grew more than 8 per cent in 2016 compared to just 1.5 per cent for foreign brands, according to a report from Bain and Kantar Worldpanel.The consumer divisions of multinationals can be hampered because they make key decisions outside China, analysts say. “Chinese brands are squeezing the global brands if [the latter] have not caught up to the upgrading trend,” said Max Lin of asset manager Actis.Some multinationals are changing the way they operate. Kraft Heinz last month launched a premium range of cookies resembling its Oreos but priced “significantly” higher than the real thing as well as domestic brands.To design the product. the company moved people to China and “built a local team based on Chinese knowledge,” says Ze Dias, China managing director at Kraft Heinz. “We like to operate like a smaller business. When it comes to how to win in the market it has to be decisions made by local people that are close to consumer needs”.New regulations will drive emissions cheats off road / From Jesse Norman MP, London, UK
54;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-03-29T05:16:46Z;Sponsors cut ties with Australian cricket after cheating scandal;LG, Asics and Magellan drop team in wake of ball-tampering affair;A lead sponsor of Australia’s cricket team has terminated its partnership with the national governing body following a cheating scandal that is now threatening the finances of the game.Magellan Financial Group, a fund management business, said on Thursday it was terminating its three-year sponsorship of Cricket Australia, worth a reported A$20m ($15.3m), because of a conspiracy by the leadership of the men’s cricket team to break the rules.The move follows separate decisions by LG Electronics and footwear company Asics to axe their sponsorship of players involved in using sandpaper on the ball to gain an advantage in a match against South Africa.“A conspiracy by the leadership of the Australian men’s Test cricket team, which broke the rules with a clear intention to gain an unfair advantage during the third Test in South Africa, goes to the heart of integrity,” said Hamish Douglass, co-founder and chief executive of Magellan.“These recent events are so inconsistent with our values that we are left with no option but to terminate our . . . partnership with Cricket Australia,” he added.The decisions by Magellan, LG and Asics highlights how corporates are becoming increasingly sensitive to reputational risk from association with bad or illegal behaviour that threatens to tarnish their brand image.In 2012, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong lost Nike, RadioShack, AB InBev and Trek as sponsors following a doping scandal. In 2016, Adidas cancelled its sponsorship of the International Association of Athletics Federations over drug taking in sport. “These decisions are not taken lightly due to commercial and legal implications,” said Sarah Jane Kelly, associate law professor at the University of Queensland. “But when the offending behaviour affects the integrity of the sport, companies do tend to act because there is a higher risk to their brand and a potential backlash from the market.”Qantas, another major sponsor, has called on Cricket Australia to make “a statement to the rest of the world” by meting out heavy punishment over the ball-tampering scandal. But it has stopped short of cancelling its support for cricket, Australia’s national sport.Cricket Australia has stripped Steve Smith of the team captaincy and David Warner of the vice-captaincy. Neither can play for their country or state for the next 12 months. A third player, Cameron Bancroft, has been similarly suspended for nine months. All three must perform 100 hours of voluntary service in the cricket community. The cheating scandal could not have come at a worse time for Cricket Australia, which is marketing its next five-year television rights package, worth up to A$1bn. It remains to be seen if the negative publicity surrounding the sport will dent the final bids put forward by Australian broadcasters, such as Channel Nine, Ten and Foxtel.“This scandal is a big hurdle that Cricket Australia will have to overcome when selling its TV rights,” said Marc C-Scott, lecturer in screen media at Victoria University in Melbourne. “With sponsors pulling out from supporting cricket it makes it more difficult for broadcasters to make back the money they pay for the broadcast rights.”
55;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-03-22T20:36:01Z;Nike earnings boosted by growth in Latin America, Asia markets;;Nike posted better than forecast sales and earnings, as growth in Asia and Latin America continue to offset sluggish demand for its sneakers and athleisure wear in the US.Sales for the three months to end of February climbed 7 per cent to $9bn, beating forecasts for $8.85bn.Sales in North America dropped 4 per cent while sales in Nike’s Greater China unit soared 15 per cent.The results follow a dramatic week in which two top executives left the company, as the world’s largest sports maker revealed it was reviewing misconduct. Trevor Edwards, the Nike brand head who was once deemed a candidate for chief executive, has resigned, while Jayme Edwards, vice-president of global categories, also left the company.A Nike spokesperson said: “There has been conduct inconsistent with Nike’s principles and we are taking the appropriate actions”.The company did not address the review in earnings release.The probe comes at a time that Nike is trying to attract more women to its stores. Nike has been selling its shoes and apparel to women at a faster pace than men for several years, making women a top priority as the company looks to ignite sales.The company is set to launch a female-centric retail concept, called Nike Unlaced, both online and in stores in the coming months.While Nike remains dominant, renewed competition from Adidas and cooling demand for athleisure has chipped at its market share, particularly in North America. Nike last year pushed out its target for reaching $50bn in sales by two years, and last summer said it would lay off 2 per cent of its workforce as it overhauls its operations.Nike lost $921m in the quarter, or 57 cents a share on a diluted basis — down from 68 cents a year ago, but better than street expectations of 53 cents. The company attributed the slide to “significantly higher income tax expense” after the US tax reform act.“There are many sceptics as to whether Nike can course correct in North America in a timely and profitable manner,” said Christopher Svezia, analyst at Wedbush Securities.
56;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

58;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-03-14T17:28:43Z;Adidas: making strides;The buzz around ‘athleisure’ and the Kanye West design partnership have boosted sales;Adidas’s three go-faster stripes are nearly 70 years old. But the brand — spotted on fashion A-listers as well as sports stars — has rarely been so cool. That has put the company on a winning streak: the share price jumped by more than a 10th after news of punchy results, higher profit targets and a share buyback.The buzz around “athleisure” — along with the popularity of retro sneakers and the Kanye West design partnership — boosted sales by 16 per cent to €21bn last year. Adidas was the fastest-growing competitor in the US sports shoe market. In China, where consumers view the brand more as a fashion label than sportswear, sales grew by nearly 30 per cent. That still leaves opportunities. China, with four times as many people, accounts for 10 per cent of the sportswear market, compared with 40 per cent for the US.Trends are fickle, yet hoodie-wearing boss Kasper Rorsted insists the vogue for comfy, sporty footwear is not a fad. Even so, he thinks sales growth is likely to slow to 10 per cent this year, dragged down in part by slower growth in western Europe.Concern about European growth prospects had weighed heavily on the shares, down by 13 per cent over the past six months. So too did Nike’s fighting talk. Its shares are up 28 per cent since October, when it unveiled a plan to take back market share.The valuation gap has narrowed, though: Adidas shares now trade at 23 times forward earnings, while Nike is on 27 times. The gap is likely to shrink, further tracking an equivalent reduction in the gap between the companies’ operating margins.That difference — once 5 percentage points — shrank last year as Adidas trimmed supply chains, consolidated product ranges and expanded its highly profitable e-commerce business. The superior profitability of Nike reflects its dominance of the US market, so Adidas has little chance of catching up completely. But so long as the gap narrows, the shares should rise.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
59;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-03-14T06:33:15Z;Adidas raises targets after profit beats forecast;;German sportswear maker Adidas is upping its pace.The Nike rival on Wednesday said it expects net profits will rise faster over the next three years than previously targeted. Adidas is now expects an annual increase in post-tax income of 22 to 24 per cent, up from 20 to 22 per cent previously.The group said its operating margin will rise to 11.5 per cent by 2020, up from the previous target of 11 per cent. An earlier revenue growth target of 10 to 12 per cent was confirmed. “We expect quality growth, with over-proportionate bottom-line improvements,” Adidas chief executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement. In 2017, the group's operating profit rose to by 31 per cent to €2.1bn, slightly ahead of analyst expectations according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence and twice as fast as sales. The operating margin increased by 1.2 percentage points to 9.8 per cent. Adidas says it wants to pay out a dividend of €2.60 per share, after €2 in the previous year. On Tuesday night, the company also announced it will spend up to €3bn on buying back its own shares over the next four years, with a third of this sum earmarked for 2018.
60;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-02-28T07:00:29Z;Sole woman: Nike embraces female footwear;The brand is rethinking how it sells trainers to women — and that means unisex sizing and curated spaces;"Many sneaker-loving women will know the frustration of spotting the perfect pair of trainers only to find out that, yet again, they only come in men’s sizes. The women’s sections of sports shops are often dominated by overtly girly details, from pink or gold trims to snakeskin inserts. Not everyone wants to do the tennis court or commute in sugary sneakers.Now, Nike has taken this realisation and made it a central part of its new female-centric retail concept, Nike Unlaced. It will take the form of an online destination on the Nike website, launching March 27, as well as a physical, curated area in key Nike Stores from the summer. Amy Montagne, global vice-president and general manager of Nike Women, says: “One of the most important things we will be doing is giving women access to and choice of product like never before. We are removing barriers with unisex sizing throughout the lines — and that includes high-heat [the most covetable] products like the new Virgil Abloh x [Air] Jordan I — which is really important for women.”Capitalising on women’s increasing appetite for cutting-edge sportswear makes sense for the brand. Although at the end of the last financial year the women’s sportswear business at Nike was worth less than the men’s, at $6.6bn compared with $16bn, sales of women’s shoes and apparel at Nike have been growing faster than men’s for several years, and they expect that trend to continue. The Unlaced concept was initially trialled in Nike retail stores in London and the brand saw strong double-digit sales increases compared with the same period the previous year.Julie Igarashi, vice-president and creative director of Nike Women, picks up on the appetite for unisex sizing: “People are multidimensional today, especially the millennial generation; we want to express our style in a variety of different ways.” And she believes that a passion for sneakers isn’t restricted to men, as is often the stereotype. She reports that when Nike hosted a pre-launch of the 1 Reimagined collection, footwear created by a 14-strong female design collective, at New York Fashion Week, “we had women queueing up to buy it — there is definitely a rise in female sneakerheads.” As part of Unlaced, consumers will have access to personal stylists, and Nike has also enlisted global fashion experts and influencers to curate their women’s products and inject a fashion sensibility that reflects their particular city.The rise of athleisure-wearing sportswear-inspired garments as everyday clothing — and the boom in gym-going — has fuelled this growth. Montagne says: “One of the things we have seen over the last few years is that women truly are the leaders of the sport and fitness lifestyle. We see a big shift in how women are living their lives, and fuelling the overall industry, and this has pushed us into some new zones.” Recent high-profile launches for women at Nike have included the campaign for their new “Pro Hijab” modest headwear and a plus-size sportswear collection.There will be a continued crossover between fashion and function. Montagne says: “We have been listening to female consumers and athletes for 40 years and we have always been rooted in performance and innovation. We have also learned that it’s really important to deliver on the fact that for women in particular there is no performance without style.”And which styles are seeing the most demand? Igarashi cites the Cortez, which was Nike’s first shoe for women, introduced in 1972 and recently reinvented. The Monarch is one of the top-selling styles ever at Nike, but it’s not everyone’s idea of a hip shoe. It’s a clumpy white normcore running trainer of the kind American dads who wouldn’t know their Balenciaga from their Balmain might wear to the mall, but over the past six months Igarashi reports that it has had a major revival as part of an ironic dad-fashion movement Nike is dubbing “Mr Nike”. In a true rejection of preconceived ideas about what women like in their shoes, the stylist Julia Sarr-Jamois will be curating a whole Mr Nike selection for Nike Unlaced, available online.

That, at least, is the flawed view of the Trump administration’s Office of the US Trade Representative.In a January 2018 report, USTR declared that “the US erred in supporting China’s entry into the WTO” and that high-level bilateral talks designed to advance market access “have largely failed”.This is a remarkable change in perspective.A little more than a year ago, under the Obama administration, the very same agency wrote that “data confirms a dramatic expansion in trade and investment among China and its many trading partners, including the US, since China joined the WTO”, noting that exports of American goods to China have increased by 500 per cent since 2001, “positioning China as the US’s largest goods market outside of North America”.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.In January 2017, USTR stated that after joining the WTO, “the Chinese government took many steps to implement China’s numerous commitments”, which “unquestionably deepened China’s integration into the WTO’s rules-based international trading system”. USTR also said that bilateral talks in the prior year [2016] had resulted in “significant progress” on a wide rate of “key trade and investment issues”.China’s WTO accession has delivered
In my view, China’s 2001 entry into the WTO has delivered benefits to a wide range of Americans and Chinese.China’s inclusion in the WTO has been a boon to many American companies. During the 15-year period when US exports to China rose by 500 per cent, our exports to the rest of the world were up by only 90 per cent.Exports to China are especially important to American farmers. China is their largest overseas market and since China’s WTO accession, the value of US agricultural exports to China has risen by 1,000 per cent. Shipments of American soybeans, for example, rose 13-fold.While it is true that US firms continue to battle against non-tariff barriers and non-transparent government regulatory policy in China, many American companies have done well in that market. Boeing, for example, has over the last five years delivered more aircraft in China than in the US. The American Chamber of Commerce in China recently reported that nearly three-quarters of their member companies are profitable, the highest proportion in three years.Exports to China create American jobs
You’ve probably read reports that imports from China led to 2.4m US job losses. But those jobs were lost over a more than 10-year period, while another study found that US exports to China directly and indirectly supported 1.8m new jobs in just one year, 2015.Another overlooked point is that imports from China are good for American household budgets. A study by economists at the New York Fed and other institutions concludes that “US consumers gained from China’s WTO entry through lower prices on varieties of manufactured goods”.Structural change in China
The Trump administration’s USTR report makes one other significant gaffe, claiming that “the state’s role in the [Chinese] economy has increased”. In fact, China’s WTO accession has driven structural changes in that country’s own economy, which have given Chinese people a better standard of living and more personal (although not yet political) freedom.The absence of political rights and the rule of law are serious long-term problems, but Chinese people have the freedom to run their own lives to a degree that was unimaginable just 25 years ago. And, in my view, continued expansion of personal freedom and wealth creation will inevitably lead to more political rights.For many years, China’s economy was dependent on investment. Today, domestic consumption accounts for the majority of economic growth and more than half of GDP.When I first worked in China during the early-1980s, there were no private companies. But small, entrepreneurial private firms now account for 85 per cent of urban employment and all new job creation.Since 2001, per capita urban household income rose by 431 per cent in China. As a result, spending by Chinese consumers — which was equal to only 27 per cent of US retail sales a decade ago — was equal to 90 per cent of American consumer spending in 2017, and is likely to surpass US retail spending by the end of the decade.This has opened up opportunities for many publicly listed American companies. General Motors sells more vehicles in China than it does in the US, and China accounts for about 20 per cent of GM’s global earnings. China contributes 19 per cent of Apple’s revenue. Nike shoe sales in China rose 19 per cent over the past quarter and accounted for about 15 per cent of total revenue. China contributes roughly 15 per cent of global earnings for firms such as Nvidia, Dolby and Tesla.Challenges remain, but engagement will deliver more than protectionism
Despite all of this progress, many challenges remain. China, for example, continues to restrict market access for foreign firms in sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals, financial services and accounting. The Trump administration should focus on this, rather than on reducing the US trade deficit with China. The trade deficit has little impact on US employment and is determined by balances between savings and investments, rather than by trade policy.Protectionist policies by the Trump administration would not further open Chinese markets for US firms. Rather, such steps would lead to retaliation, which would reduce US exports and harm the many American jobs they support. Protectionism would hurt American families, because imports have resulted in more affordable prices for many consumer goods.Andy Rothman is Investment Strategist at Matthews Asia, an asset management firm."
62;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-02-05T05:00:40Z;Why sleeping more will help the national economy;A new understanding of circadian rythyms is helping combat the silent sleep-loss epidemic;"It sounds like an absurdly simple way to improve public health and boost the economy: delay the start of the school day until 8.30am at the earliest. Yet a recent study by RAND, the research organisation, estimated that such a move in the US, where classes often begin well before 8am, would add $83bn to the national economy over a decade, and $140bn over 15 years, by raising students’ academic attainments and reducing illness.The RAND report is the latest manifestation of a growing concern that inadequate and ill-timed sleep is causing a public health disaster in the industrialised world. Matthew Walker, neuroscience professor at the University of California, Berkeley, describes a silent sleep loss epidemic in his book Why We Sleep, published last summer. He says changing social and employment patterns and new sleep-disrupting consumer products such as smartphones, are “having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity and the education of our children.”Students in secondary schools are particularly vulnerable as a result of biological changes during adolescence, which push back their circadian rhythm — the natural body clock that controls the sleep-wake cycle — by as much as three hours compared with the adult cycle. Even if they go to bed early and are not distracted by smartphones and social media, they struggle to fall asleep and then fail to get enough sleep before having to get up for an early school start.Medical bodies such as the US Centres for Disease Control and the American Academy of Paediatrics recommend that no school should begin work before 8.30am. Yet the CDC estimates that 93 per cent of US high schools fail this test. Many start before 7.30am, with school buses beginning to pick up students as early as 5.45am. As Prof Walker puts it, “this is lunacy”. The problem is less acute in most other countries; start times in the UK are typically 8.30am to 8.45am.We asked readers, researchers and FT journalists to submit ideas with the potential to change the world. A panel of judges selected the 50 ideas worth looking at in more detail. This third tranche of 30 ideas (listed below) is about new ways to handle information and education. The next 10 ideas, looking at advances in healthcare, will be published on March 5, 2018.In the face of a growing public clamour for later starts, many education authorities in the US have resisted on grounds ranging from the convenience of working parents to the cost of changing school bus schedules and the logistics of fitting in extracurricular activities.The RAND study found, however, that such costs of change would be far outweighed by the gains resulting from better academic performance and health, as adolescents benefit from more sleep. There is also a gain from reduction in car crashes, which are more likely when people are sleep-deprived.A scan of regional and local news media across the US suggests that the message is beginning to get through, as more school districts are starting later, but there is scope for more progress.>$400bnAnnual cost to the US economy of employees sleeping fewer than seven hours a nightWhile shifting the hours of the school day is, at least in some districts, a potential quick hit in the battle to engineer a more sleep-friendly society, there are many other arenas where change is desirable. A key one is the workplace, where a “sleep is for wimps” attitude is still common.A 2016 RAND report estimated that employees sleeping fewer than seven hours per night cost the US more than $400bn a year, and the UK $40bn a year, because their performance at work is less productive than it would be if they slept for at least eight hours. The total economic cost of inadequate sleep is about 2 per cent of GDP.Yet here too change is under way. Companies such as Procter & Gamble offer employees “sleep hygiene” courses, Prof Walker says, while Nike and Google allow employees to match their work hours to their individual circadian rhythms. A growing number of companies are installing “nap pods” in their office buildings.Hospitals often represent a nadir of sleep deprivation, with exhausted doctors and nurses putting their patients’ and their own health at risk. Long periods on duty without sleep, which are still required during medical training in many countries, lead junior doctors to make avoidable errors. While reform is in the air here too, more radical action is required to protect hospital doctors and patients from the adverse consequences of sleep deprivation.Patients also benefit from sleeping well in hospital. That means deploying noisy equipment and alarms only when they are really necessary, lighting wards at night as dimly as consistent with safety, and supplying ear plugs and eyemasks to patients who want them.Babies who are ill or born prematurely pose a particular challenge. Their developing brains should be sleeping most of the time, yet the strong lighting and noise of most neonatal intense care units makes this difficult to achieve. Recent research has shown — not surprisingly — that neonatal units in which lighting is dimmed as far as possible are associated with better sleep for the infants and earlier discharge from hospital.Every baby, child and adult deserves an opportunity to sleep well, whether in hospital, at home or at work. His or her health will depend on it."

It has annual revenues of around $1.9bn.
64;NKE;Nike Inc;2018-01-21T17:15:05Z;Puma recovery gathers pace;Sportswear brand hopes to close gap on rivals but concedes it has much to do;"Björn Gulden describes Puma as “the fastest sports brand in the world”. Yet when it comes to his company’s performance, the chief executive stresses one thing above all else: patience.The smaller rival to Germany’s other sportswear giant Adidas is in the midst of a revival. After years of lacklustre sales growth and plunging profits, sales in the first nine months of 2017 jumped 16 per cent, while its operating margin almost doubled to just below 7 per cent. The shares are up almost a third over a year, twice as much as Adidas.But Mr Gulden, a former Norwegian professional footballer, acknowledges: “Our turnaround is a long journey, and it is far from over.”The recovery is entering a new phase as current majority shareholder, French luxury group Kering, sells down its Puma stake. The owner of Gucci this month announced that it will lower its holding from 86.3 per cent to 16 per cent.A decade after becoming Puma’s majority shareholder, it plans to hand over 70 per cent of Puma stock to its investors. The non-cash transaction worth €3.5bn at current prices would turn Kering’s controlling investor, France’s billionaire Pinault family, into Puma’s biggest single shareholder. Its Artémis holding company will have a 29 per cent stake and says it sees itself as a “long-term strategic shareholder of Puma”. The sportswear maker’s free float would almost quadruple to 55 per cent.A day after the announcement, Puma shares tumbled. Analysts say the fall was driven by fading hopes of a takeover premium, as speculation about a sale to a strategic buyer or private equity had inflated the stock, rather than any concern over the change of ownership.“Kering’s exit opens a window of opportunity” for outside investors, says Jörg Philipp Frey, an analyst with Warburg Research. “The turnaround of Puma is now visible and in full swing.”Mr Frey adds that the higher free float should tempt external investors. Others say Puma’s valuation seems rich. The stock is trading at close to 28 times forecast earnings, compared with Adidas’s multiple of about 22 times, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.The brand was founded in 1948, after brothers Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, who owned a shoe factory, fell out and set up alone. Adolf launched Adidas, while Rudolf created Puma. To this day, both companies are located in Herzogenaurach, a sleepy Bavarian town of 24,000 inhabitants just outside Nuremberg.Over the past decade, Puma has fallen further behind its rival. Sales at Adidas are more than five times larger than Puma’s €4bn, compared with 4.3 times in 2007. Analysts expect the gap to widen over the next three years; according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus forecasts they predict average annual sales growth of 9.6 per cent at Adidas, compared with 8.7 per cent at Puma. The world’s largest sportswear maker Nike, with annual sales of $34.7bn, is not only seven times larger, it also cranks out an operating margin twice as big as Puma’s.While Puma’s operating profit margin has improved, it is still no match to the 9.3 per cent that analysts forecast for Adidas. Mr Gulden acknowledges without hesitation: “Our financial ratios are still unimpressive. We have a lot of room for improvement.”He adds: “Well-managed companies in our sector earn operating margins between 8 and 12 per cent. This is a level of profitability Puma should also be able to achieve.”Mr Gulden says the change in ownership will bring no disruption to operations. “For Puma and its employees, Kering’s decision is by far the best possible outcome,” he says. The cost synergies Kering envisaged when buying into Puma a decade ago never materialised, he adds.Under Mr Gulden’s leadership, the gap between Puma and its majority owner’s other business has grown, as the former Adidas manager steered the group away from fashion back to its roots in sports, investing heavily in product innovation and marketing.In 2014 it became the kit supplier of the English Premier League football club Arsenal. A year later the company, which had sponsored Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, launched a new generation of running shoes that use foam technology, which it says “maximises energy return”. Earlier than its larger rivals, Puma started to focus on female customers, signing Barbadian pop singer Rihanna as creative director for its women’s collection and this month launching a marketing push featuring actress Selena Gomez.“Thanks to new products, Puma managed to win back retailers and consumers,” says Commerzbank analyst Andreas Riemann.Mr Gulden, who raised his 2017 guidance three times last year, says Puma could have grown even faster, “but there is only so much growth a company can digest at a time”, adding that delivering high-quality products on time is a challenge.The Puma chief refuses to specify how long investors will have to wait before seeing the level of returns that its domestic rival achieves.However, he says one missing link is Puma’s lack of presence in big US sports such as football, baseball and basketball. “As a global sports brand, we need to be there,” says Mr Gulden. So far, the group has lacked the financial strength for such an investment but as the turnround is gaining pace, “it is logical that the point where we can make the move is coming closer”."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 24,757, under the heel of a 2.3 per cent loss for athletic gear giant Nike, whose most recent quarterly earnings underwhelmed Wall Street. The Nasdaq Composite was also off 0.07 per cent to 6,960.For the week, the S&P gained 0.29 per cent for its fifth winning week in a row. The Dow also advanced for the fifth straight week with a 0.42 per cent increase, and the Nasdaq extended notched a second week in the black, ending 0.34 per cent higher.The dollar index was relatively unmoved over the day, ending up a hair at 93.33. The same complacency settled over yields on the 10-year US Treasury note, which ended the week at 2.48 per cent.
66;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Nike sales grow despite North American stumble;;Nike’s quarterly sales grew at a steady pace in the past quarter, with the sportswear company’s accelerating gains in international markets helping to offset sluggishness in its home market in North America.Revenue for the three-month period ending November 30 were $8.6bn, a 5 per cent increase from the same period last year. Sales in its largest North American market dropped 5 per cent year-over-year to $3.485bn, although its Greater China unit saw sales leap 16 per cent, alongside a 19 per cent gain in Europe, Middle East and Africa.Net income dropped 9 per cent to $767m, and diluted earnings per share were down 8 per cent year-over-year to 46 cents, which the company attributed to declining gross margin, lower tax rate and lower average share count.Analysts had been looking for $8.4bn in sales. Net income was estimated to come in at $1.12bn, or 40 cents a share. Gross margin fell 120 basis points to 43 per centNike recently re-affirmed its bold prediction of $50bn in sales within the next five years. This optimistic vision was laid out in October at its first investor day in two years, at which the company brushed off concerns that the dominant sports brand is starting to its allure. In June, the company announced plans to lay off 2 per cent of its workforce and re-align its operations to be more nimble and responsive to fast-changing consumer tastes, in order to keep one step ahead of sportswear rivals like Adidas.Nike chief executive and chairman Mark Parker credited this “Consumer Direct Offense” strategy for the quarter’s performance, saying the company “accelerated international growth and built underlying momentum in our domestic business.”“For the back half of the fiscal year, Nike’s innovation line-up is as strong as it’s ever been and we’ll continue to actively shape retail through new differentiated experiences.”Year to date, its shares are up 27.4 per cent. Thursday’s earnings sent it shares dropped 0.7 per cent in after-hours trading.
67;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;The blood and sweat in phones and batteries;Cleaning up supply chains is a necessary part of defending a brand;It took Nike nearly 15 years to clear the stain on its brand caused by revelations about its use of sweatshops in the developing world. Today, in light of subsequent scandals and tragedies, not only is there greater scrutiny of the global supply chains used by multinationals and wider consumer awareness of the pitfalls of outsourcing manufacturing. Technology has also made it easier to monitor where and under what conditions things are made. There should be fewer excuses therefore for unethical behaviour.Yet big companies continue running into trouble. A Financial Times investigation revealed this week that Apple iPhones were being manufactured at a plant in China where school interns were forced to work illegal overtime. This was not the most shocking instance of exploitation. It is nonetheless unacceptable that one of the richest companies in the history of companies, had not conducted more effective due diligence of its supply chain.Foxconn, the main supplier of iPhones had turned to cheap student labour to catch up with a rush of orders of Apple’s anniversary iPhone X. The company says it has now halted abuse at its Zhengzhou plant. But it should not have required bad publicity for them to do so. Increased demand is no excuse for condoning exploitation.There are lessons in the Nike story. By 2005 the company became the first in its industry to publish a complete list of the factories it contracts with. It had also, in preceding years, conducted audits at 600 plants. These showed that abuses still occurred. But they also showed that the company was making an effort to end them.The sportswear company was obliged to introduce this level of transparency to detoxify a brand, which in the words of one former chief executive had become “synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse”. There was no other way to halt the protests that were denting sales.To be fair to Apple, many Chinese factories have cleaned up their acts, although the practice of outsourcing to smaller “black factories”, when orders are too great to cope with, continues. These outfits come and go like flash floods — when opportunity arises. They go unmonitored and pay scant attention to workers’ rights.The bigger problems occur where manufacturing capacity has moved out of China, in particular to low-wage Bangladesh. They are also to be found where primary resources are mined. Nowhere is more troubling than the Democratic Republic of Congo.Prompted by a report from Amnesty International, the London Metal Exchange has launched an investigation into whether cobalt mined by child labourers is being traded on the exchange. Demand for cobalt has pushed prices up by 80 per cent this year and is only likely to increase as more electric cars take to the roads.Congo, the epitome of a failed state, produces more than half the world’s supply. So, it is nigh on impossible to cut it out altogether. Besides, recent experience shows that often action designed in the developed world to ease western consumer consciences can have grave unintended consequences at source. This has been the case with efforts to halt the exploitation by Congolese militia of coltan, used in mobile phones. Hundreds of thousands of legitimate jobs in Congo have been lost as a result.Constraining whole industries is not necessarily the answer. Besides, most companies have the wherewithal to do a better job of policing their own supply chains. To paraphrase Amnesty, they should not need to be named and shamed before they act.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was largely flat at 23,387, held back by early losses for Nike and Wal-Mart.The gains were propelled by upbeat data showing the US GDP grew at a 3 per cent annual rate from July through September.Tech stocks were also flying high after a round of strong earnings Thursday evening — among them ecommerce giant Amazon, which gained 9 per cent after the opening bell. Microsoft and Intel also hit new record highs at the start of trading, according to Thomson Reuters data.The dollar built on Thursday’s gains, with the dollar index — measuring the buck against a basket of peers — up 0.4 per cent to 95.02, propelled in part by softer euro and sterling. Yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was largely unchanged at 2.44 per cent.

The Nasdaq Composite finished little changed at 6,556.77.The moves came as athletic gear maker Nike raised its growth target at its investor day, and earnings from social media site Twitter and automaker Ford topped estimates.Markets are also awaiting results from some of the biggest tech players like Alphabet, Amazon, Intel and Microsoft — which represent a combined $1.9tn in market valuation — due after the bell.Meanwhile, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of six peers, rose 1.1 per cent to 94.68, on track for its best day since mid-December. The moves came amid optimism on tax reform and a report from Politico that Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is out of the running to keep her seat, signalling that US President Donald Trump could nominate a hawk to serve as the central bank’s chair.
70;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-10-25T23:11:38Z;Nike re-affirms $50bn sales goal in next five years;Chief executive adjusts growth plans in face of grim retail landscape;Nike pressed ahead with an optimistic vision for its future on Wednesday, brushing off increasing concerns that the once-unassailable sports brand is stumbling amid a grim retail landscape. At a lavish investor day in Oregon, the company’s first in two years, the maker of Air Jordan and Chuck Taylor footwear forecast that sales would rise in the “high single digits” over the next five years.After boldly predicting sales of $50bn by 2020 at Nike’s previous investor day, analysts have widely anticipated that the company will fall short by about $10bn.Mark Parker, chief executive, told CNBC on Wednesday it would now reach the $50bn milestone “within the next five years”. The company reported $34.4bn in sales for the 2017 fiscal year.Investors cheered the comments, sending Nike shares up as much as 4.5 per cent on Wednesday. After more than tripling from 2010 to 2015, Nike’s stock has dropped about 15 per cent as the frenzy over athleisure — wearing sports clothing outside of the gym — has cooled, and as rivals such as Adidas have gained market share. As sales have slowed, prompting Nike to offer rare sales promotions and announce a round of lay-offs, Mr Parker looked to reassure investors that the company is on track.“Where others see disruption to old models, we see opportunities for growth,” he said, before welcoming NBA star Kobe Bryant to the stage. “Our relentless drive to serve our consumers is as resolute today as ever.”He also said Nike would deliver growth in earnings per share in the “mid-teens” over the next five years, unchanged from his previous estimate. After years of roaring growth, Nike’s strong lead in the sports-shoe market has been chipped away. According to NPD group, Adidas last month surpassed Nike’s Jordan brand to become the second most popular sneaker brand in the US, which Mr Powell said he “never thought I would see in my lifetime”. In the first eight months of the year, Adidas’s US market share nearly doubled to about 11.3 per cent as the German company recaptured its 2000s-era sheen, helped by a partnership with Kanye West, whose Yeezy line GQ described as “the coolest shoes on the planet”. “[Adidas] is making products that the kids want to buy,” Mr Powell said. Nike has also felt the structural pain that has hit bricks-and-mortar stores this year. As more people buy shoes from their computers at home, sales have plunged at stores like Foot Locker, traditional stalwarts of American shopping malls. Foot Locker, Finish Line and Dick’s Sporting Goods in their most recent earnings announcements cut forecasts by about one-third, with Foot Locker’s chief executive noting declining sales of Air Jordans.Nike has responded with a sweeping restructuring plan. Company executives say they want to make sneakers faster, sell more directly to customers and pull their shoes from the shelves of “non-premium” retailers, instead focusing on stores that they can better control to offer a unique shopping experience. The company on Wednesday pushed further in this direction, saying it would focus on only 40 retail partnerships out of some 30,000. “Undifferentiated, mediocre retail won’t survive,” explained Trevor Edwards, president of Nike brand.Amazon will be among those retailers to be retained. After decades of refusing to put its shoes on the site, Nike in June relented, and confirmed on Wednesday that Amazon, as well as WeChat, Nordstrom and Foot Locker, would remain retail partners. Mr Parker said he expected digital sales to double to about 30 per cent of Nike’s business in the next five years, and that three-quarters of growth would come from outside the US.
71;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-10-25T17:13:16Z;Nike shares gain ground as CEO affirms ambitious profit-growth estimates;;Shares in Nike rose after chief executive Mark Parker affirmed ambitious estimates for profit growth in the next five years.During its first investor day in two years, Mr Parker said that he expects earnings per share to grow in the “mid-teens” in the next five years, unchanged from his optimism in 2015. The executive also said he expects “high single digit” sales growth in the next 5 years.Nike’s stock jumped 4.4 per cent higher, after falling as much as 2 per cent Wednesday morning.Nike in 2015 had laid out an ambitious sales target of $50bn by 2020, as Mr Parker declared the company to be at “an all-time high”. Since then, Nike’s share price has dropped more than 15 per cent as the frenzy over athleisure has slowed, competitors have stolen market share and the growing dominance of Amazon has muddied the distribution models for retailers.Analysts and investors have speculated about whether the company will pare back its lofty $50bn goal, although Mr Parker did not address it in opening remarks in Oregon.Aiming to reassuring investors, Mr Parker said “our relentless drive to serve our consumers is as resolute today as ever”.
72;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-10-22T10:18:42Z;Nike’s focus on robotics threatens Asia’s low-cost workforce;Developing countries at risk of losing cheap manufacturing if leisurewear companies accelerate automation;An avid marathon runner, Knox Robinson can wear through a dozen pairs of trainers a year. Yet when it comes to racing, he has one go-to shoe — the Nike Flyknit Racer.For many athletes, the specially designed knitted upper section creates a more seamless, form-fitting shoe, something few other brands have matched.“I loved it when it came out. I thought it had such an elegant construction,” says Mr Robinson, before a running club meet-up in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. It reminded him of the running shoes his father once wore, “the kind of classic Nike shoe you see in photos”.Since its debut in 2012, the Flyknit Racer has been considered a technological breakthrough. Produced with a special knitting machine, it uses less labour and fewer materials than most running shoes. But now the same material has become the basis for an even more radical experiment that has the potential to both upend the sports and leisurewear industry and accelerate an important trend in globalisation.Since 2015, Nike has been working with Flex, the high-tech manufacturing company better known for producing Fitbit activity trackers and Lenovo servers, to introduce greater automation into the otherwise labour-intensive process of making a shoe.Flex’s facility in Mexico has become one of Nike’s most important factories, responsible not just for a growing slice of the company’s production but also for a string of innovations to be rolled out across Nike’s supplier base, such as laser-cutting and automated gluing.For Nike, the shift to greater automation has two huge attractions. By driving down costs, it could lead to a dramatic improvement in profit margins. It would also allow the company to deliver new designs more quickly to fickle, fashion-conscious customers at a premium. A pair of Nike Roshe shoes costs $75 without Flyknit uppers, compared to as much as $130 with Flyknit.“Together, we are modernising the footwear industry,” Chris Collier, Flex chief financial officer, said earlier this year about the company’s relationship with Nike. “This is a long-term, multibillion-dollar relationship for us, and it is not measured in the scope of years but decades.”The tie-up with Flex also has a much broader resonance. Over the past two decades, Nike has been one of the pioneers in outsourcing production to the developing world, where it has been the subject of accusations of using child labour and other workforce abuses.Yet many of those countries now fear that robots will deprive them of their shot at industrialisation. If Nike pushes through with a move to greater automation and ends up cutting production in Asia, the company could find itself at the forefront of a different political controversy.Nike says growing sales will allow it to embrace more automation while maintaining its present workforce. But the company is one of the biggest multinational employers, with more than 493,000 line workers — in 15 countries — involved in the production of Nike footwear. For all the group’s products, its contracted factories employ 1.02m workers in 42 countries.Sridhar Tayur, a professor of operations management at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, says the decisions made by Nike about how far to use automation would be a significant milestone in the industry.“The very-low labour costs in Asia are no longer that low unless you go to Africa or somewhere else . . . The pressure has been mounting for a long time to either move to a super low-cost place or automate more,” he says. “That has come to a point where people are more seriously looking to automation.”Nike has made efforts to rebrand itself as an ethical and sustainable business, he says, but any deviation from that narrative could spur a backlash. “The consumer in the US has become much more sophisticated in their understanding of injustices,” Mr Tayur says. “Nike has taken the position that they are not going to be doing the minimum effort”, which has placed the group under higher scrutiny. “Imagine the backlash, if the promise isn’t met,” he adds.Nike is in need of a boost. At $34.4bn in sales for the 2017 fiscal year, the group has a long way to go in reaching its ambitious $50bn revenue goal for 2020. Mark Parker, chief executive, had set the goal in 2015, at a time when Nike appeared poised to lead the “ athleisure ” trend of wearing workout gear outside the gym. However, the company has since struggled to boost growth in the face of heated competition and a resurgence by Germany’s Adidas in North America.The potential upside for Nike of greater automation is immense. Analysts at Citibank estimate that by using the Flex manufacturing process to produce Nike’s 2017 Air Max shoes, one of its top-selling lines, the cost of labour would decrease 50 per cent and materials costs would fall 20 per cent. That would equate to a 12.5 percentage point increase in gross margins to 55.5 per cent, according to analysts Jim Suva and Kate McShane.If Flex were to produce 30 per cent of Nike’s North American footwear sales, Nike could save $400m in labour and material costs, representing a 5 per cent benefit to earnings per share, according to Citibank estimates.“We believe the apparel industry is likely to watch this closely. And if it’s successful, we could see more room [for automation] to come,” says Mr Suva.The impetus to use automation is not just about costs: it is also trying to keep up with consumers. Across the board, the most successful retailers are now those with a constant stream of new products to meet rapidly changing tastes and shopping habits. Yet companies have been slow to adapt footwear, with its more complicated manufacturing process, to so-called fast fashion trends — at least until now.With more than 1m pairs of Nike shoes produced at its facilities in Guadalajara, Mike Dennison, another senior Flex executive, says it is “completely reinventing” the industry “with a significantly smaller workforce than what you’d find in Asia”.Traditional shoe production has required as many as 200 different pieces across 10 sizes, often cut and glued together by hand. The new manufacturing process being developed by Flex has introduced two ideas once thought impossible: the gluing process has been automated and lasers are used to cut the Flyknit material.Lead times in the shoe industry once ran to several months: Flex has promised to help Nike speed up lead times, which can be three to four weeks for a customised pair of sneakers.Nike contractor factories worldwide in 2017, down from 785 in 2013Nike’s revenue target for 2020. It made $34.4bn in sales last yearNike footwear line workers based in Vietnam, Indonesia and ChinaMoving production closer to its key markets will help satisfy some of that demand. However, for companies such as Nike, it opens up new political issues in the countries where it has been operating for the past two decades. The company risks being attacked for depriving jobs to its Asian workers — the same ones it was once accused of mistreating.Nike became a lightning rod for criticism about shoddy practices by multinationals in the mid-1990s and early 2000s when it was accused by non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam and Global Exchange of tolerating sweatshops and child labour in its factories and among its suppliers in several Asian countries.Although the group has taken considerable strides since then to change its labour practices, it has continued to come under criticism. Last year, students at Georgetown University in Washington pushed it end a contract with Nike over a dispute with an NGO called Worker Rights Consortium.An independent investigator, WRC has criticised Nike within the past two years for not doing enough to address problems at one of its supplier’s factories, Hansae Vietnam, which had included unjust firings, uncompensated work and unsafe working conditions. Nike says every contract factory is held to a rigorous set of standards and is regularly audited to assess compliance efforts. Georgetown eventually renewed the contract once a new monitoring agreement had been put in place.Nike has reduced its supply chain by nearly 200 factories in the past five years to focus on fewer “quality, long-term partnerships”. However, the process of closing a factory, including those with compliance issues, can be a long and costly process for “brand sensitive companies like Nike” to mitigate the disruption to local economies, says Tara Rangarajan, a global operations manager at BetterWork, a partnership between the UN’s International Labour Organisation and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, which focuses on working conditions in the garment industry.She says companies such as Nike “engage very deeply in the countries they operate”, working alongside government officials, factory owners and union representatives.The ILO estimates about 56 per cent of employment in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam is at a high risk of being automated over the next decade or two, with clothing and footwear manufacturing jobs among the hardest hit. More than 75 per cent of footwear line workers for Nike work in Vietnam, Indonesia and China.Nike says that if sales continue to grow, it will not lose jobs in its supply chain. “We are definitely on a mission to bring more automation and innovation into the way we manufacture our products,” says Eric Sprunk, Nike executive vice-president and chief operating officer.“We don’t hide from the fact it affects the labour base,” he says. “But we don’t expect there to be any displaced workers. We are going to need just as many manufacturing jobs in our source base.However as the company intends to pursue greater regional manufacturing, bringing its production closer to its key customers in North America, “certain countries will see a change in the labour base,” Mr Sprunk says. “We’ll need to be more agile in our manufacturing base.”FT editors select the stories that explain the threat automation poses to emerging economies—Jae-Hee Chang, co-author of an ILO report on Asian employment, says that if the changes are slow and communicated clearly and if factories are given the opportunity to implement changes, the job losses from automation will not be as severe as they otherwise could be.Ms Chang says she would be watching to see how brands such as Nike prepare their supply chain for changes. The ILO has been in discussions with employers and governments to discuss how advanced training and early adoption of new technologies can blunt the impact of greater automation on the workforce.“There will be jobs, but they will be available to people who can maintain, troubleshoot and work alongside robots,” Ms Chang says. “There’s going to be people possibly displaced and they will not automatically have jobs in that sector unless they acquire new training. Those are the people that are going to be most affected.”Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, added that it did not make sense to oppose automation, as increases in productivity should help everyone.“When the benefits of increased automation accrue to a tiny portion of the population, then that’s a problem,” he says. “Over the past couple [of] decades, most of the monetary benefits of increased productivity have accrued to the owners of stock and senior executives of a company, not to the whole of the population.”Nike is out in front in embracing new production techniques, but analysts say rivals Under Armour and Adidas are nipping at the brand’s heels. After the success of its first Speedfactory in Germany, Adidas is scheduled to open its second partially automated factory in Atlanta as a part of its 2020 goal of lowering lead times and increasing its share of quick-turnround products.In its pilot Speedfactory, it took about five hours to make a pair of shoes from start to finish, whereas the same process through its existing supply chains in Asia can take several weeks, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.Adidas has used 3D printing technology to produce a shoe — known as the Futurecraft — in the factory. The company says this could change the way shoes are sold: in the future it hopes to use digital imaging technology to produce custom, on-the-spot footwear for customers.Elsewhere, Under Armour has also signalled plans for more manufacturing in the US with the opening of a manufacturing and design centre in Baltimore. Earlier this year the centre designed and printed Under Armour’s third iteration of 3D printed footwear with its ArchiTech Futurist shoe, which sold out in 14 minutes.Despite the advances, however, Citi analysts take a somewhat negative view of 3D printing for footwear. The speed, reliability and cost at high volumes of 3D printing are still limiting factors. Additionally, the shoes that use the technology have met with mixed reviews.“We know that most of the apparel and footwear manufacturers are getting more flexible and creative on the supply chain side,” says Kate McShane at Citi.” But Nike has really taken the lead in creating new manufacturing standards for the rest of the industry.”No need to be alarmist over developing countries and the rise of robotics / From Jörg Mayer, Unctad, Geneva, Switzerland
73;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;US stocks slip from record highs;;US stocks pulled back from record levels on Thursday as consumer staples slid and China’s central bank governor warned of a ‘Minsky moment’.The S&P 500 declined 0.3 per cent to 2,552.58 — led by a 1.1 per cent rally in the telecoms sector that was partially offset by a 0.7 per cent drop in consumer staples.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 23,081.81, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.7 per cent to 6,578.30.The slide in US stocks came amid a mixed batch of results. Shares in Phillips Morris slipped after it missed earnings forecasts, while eBay shares declined after the online marketplace issued disappointing guidance. American Express shares were down after it announced a change of leadership and Nike shares were hit by an analyst downgrade.Investors appeared to shrug off positive economic data that showed that the number of Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level since 1973 as the labour department said procedures to take claims were still severely disrupted in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands due to the impact of the a recent string of hurricanes.The decline also came as the governor of the People’s Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, cautioned, on the sidelines of the Communist Party Congress in Beijing, about a possible ‘Minsky moment’ — a theory named after economist Hyman Minsky who argued that periods of speculation and excessive credit growth can inflate assets and result in a crisis. Mr Zhou is reported to have said that debt levels are rising too quickly and that China needs to guard against excessive optimism that could lead to a “Minsky Moment’’.Elsewhere, Treasuries rallied, with the yield on the US 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to price, falling 4.5 basis points to 2.302 per cent. Meanwhile, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of six peers, fell 0.3 per cent to 93.07.
74;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-09-29T04:00:28Z;Meet Nike sneaker legend Tinker Hatfield;As the sportswear giant brings its self-lacing shoe to Europe, Hatfield talks innovation and imagination;"Inside the megalithic Nike Store on Oxford Circus, central London, a small area has been cordoned off to showcase the arrival of the world’s most futuristic shoe to Europe. Amid the blue lights flashing away like a space-age disco, sits Tinker Hatfield, Nike’s vice-president for innovation design and special projects, designer of the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0.Sneaker obsessives won’t need any introduction to Hatfield or to the HyperAdapt. He’s one of the most influential men in footwear, the technically ambitious cult creator of such classic trainers as the Air Max 1, Air Trainer 1, Air Safari and the Air Jordan III. And the HyperAdapt? That’s Nike’s first commercial self-lacing trainer, inspired by the shoes teenager Marty McFly wears in the film Back to the Future Part II.Remember the scene where McFly visits the year 2015, and puts on a pair of high-tops that lace up on their own? Hatfield made those shoes for the film in 1989, and now — almost 30 years later — he’s brought them to market. After creating 89 versions called the Nike Mag in 2016, the sales of which raised $6.75m for Michael J Fox’s Parkinson’s charity, a limited number of the more wearable HyperAdapt went on sale in the US at the end of last year. Today a limited number will be available via the Nike app in 19 European countries, and the Oxford Street Niketown.Hatfield joined Nike in 1981 and later worked with director Robert Zemeckis on Back to the Future. The baseball cap-wearing American says the filmmakers initially suggested “a shoe that’s magnetic so you could walk up a wall or stand on the ceiling, and I told them that was an old gag”.He didn’t immediately see the shoes’ commercial potential. “We didn’t think about trying to actually make them until 20 years later because the technology wasn’t there.” The shoes work via a concealed motor that is attached to five cables that come down either side of the foot. They are battery-operated and need to be charged every two weeks.Of course, the mechanism seems irrelevant when you put them on, an experience akin to a sportswear Cinderella moment — you shall go to the basketball court! You slip your foot inside the shoes — the battery-pack sole glowing with a sci-fi luminescence — and, as if by magic, the shoes vacuum pack around your foot. You can press a button to loosen and tighten rapidly.As well as Back to the Future, the shoe’s styling was also inspired by the robot Eve in the Pixar movie Wall-E. Hatfield adds: “Innovation is a word that gets thrown out all over the place. That is always going to be our guiding light but, knowing that, we try to add storyline and art to our designs.”Nike will doubtless be hoping that the latest bit of buzz around the shoes gives the brand a boost and helps bolster their influence as Adidas eats into market share. Nike Inc announced results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday and reported a 4 per cent fall in share price before closing the day 1.9 per cent lower. Sales declined in its most recent quarter, to $9.07bn, only a minor change from the same time last year, and less of a fall than expected. The sportswear giant is set to overhaul the business; in June it shared plans to cut 2 per cent of its international workforce. The limited-edition shoes cost £620, so individual sales aren’t exactly going to single-handedly lift Nike’s profits, but the mix of innovation, story and an emotional connection between consumer and product is part of what informs Nike’s brand identity.Hatfield says: “Apple is kind of our model; they want to be first and they are doing something that no one else is doing, so they get it out there and tell a good story. We have different strategies: some shoes are designed to shake up the country club a little bit and others are going to be more evolutionary in nature, not revolutionary. Sometimes you have to back off from being too crazy.”Sometimes, though, the public do catch on, as with the Sock Dart, a stretchy, tubular sock on top of a sole, which Hatfield launched 15 years ago, only to see it “catch fire” in recent sales.But how many customers actually need the sporting technology of the self-lacing shoe? Hatfield says: “Our primary customer is the athlete, but we also know the bulk of our sales come from people looking for comfort and fashion. It’s like the car that goes at 150mph. No one drives at that speed, but it’s the coolest cars that go fast.”"

That translated to 57 cents a share, beating consensus forecasts for 48 cents a share.Nike reported sales of $9.07bn, a hair below forecasts for $9.08bn and little changed from the same time last year.In June the company revealed plans to cut 1,400 jobs, or 2 per cent of its global workforce. It has spearheaded, and been the biggest beneficiary of, the athleisure trend — the popularity in recent years of wearing workout clothing outside of the gym.However, it has been losing market share to rival Adidas, threatening its dominance of the footwear market, and analysts have warned that athleisure may be losing steam.The volume and pricing of Nike shoes fell sharply in July and August as Adidas launched further products, according to Morgan Stanley.Sportswear retailers that sell Nike products have struggled in recent months, as Foot Locker, Finish Line and Dick’s Sporting Goods reported weaker sales and slashed forecasts for upcoming quarters. Nike has said it would try to sell more directly to consumers and recently revealed plans to sell some of its shoes on Amazon, after decades of holding out on the ecommerce site.The declines in Nike shares came as US stocks edged up as US President Donald Trump announced plans to slash the corporate tax rate. By the close in New York on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 2,507, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 22,340 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 6,453.Elsewhere, shares in Micron Technology jumped 8.5 per cent to $37.09 after the memory chipmaker posted upbeat fiscal fourth-quarter results.The Idaho-based company said it swung to a profit of $2.37bn, or $1.99 a share, compared with a loss of $170m, or 16 cents a share, in the year-ago period, “reflecting solid execution and robust demand for our memory and storage solutions”.

78;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-09-06T05:33:05Z;Sports Direct: trading up;Shift upmarket demands new chairman to serve as counterweight to Mike Ashley;Damascene conversions in commerce are nothing new. Often, they include the discovery that being nice to customers pays. Or that robust corporate governance improves relations with investors. Both have been a revelation to Sports Direct. Yet, the British retailer’s new strategy will require more than a mere epiphany.Once an aggressive discounter, Sports Direct now fancies itself as an upmarket purveyor of sports wear. And, after subjection to a Saul-style persecution last year, founder and chief executive Mike Ashley changed the group’s working practices, admitted past mistakes and reimbursed employees previously paid below minimum wage. A worker, as observer, now sits on the board. Mr Ashley appointed his first chief financial officer in four years. Hey presto: the shares are up over a third this year.But it is not enough. Ahead of today’s annual meeting, Hermes Investment Management demanded a new non-executive chairman. Incumbent Keith Hellawell has had the job for nearly eight years and done little with it. Other shareholders agree that a robust new chairman should act as a counterweight to Mr Ashley and improve shareholder engagement.This is not just about ticking stewardship boxes, though. Sports Direct has big plans. It aims to create 125 new, larger format shops. This modest move upmarket will cost more than £300m annually, partly because Sports Direct prefers to own the freeholds to its stores. Last year, it opened 15 shops, a pace that suggests this spending spree will go on for many years. Debt will rise to cover this investment. Its operating cash flow has never crested much above £230m, though its finances are healthy enough to absorb more leverage.The shift upmarket is partly driven by necessity. Key suppliers such as Nike want more control over the shopping experience. Sports Direct has much work ahead of it. A new chairman is needed to help guide the new strategy.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

79;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-08-30T17:19:34Z;US footwear: fit to be tied;A price war looms as teenagers balk at expensive trainers;In an iconic ad from Nike in the 1980s, a young Spike Lee declares, “It must be the shoes” explaining Michael Jordan’s mad basketball skills. Three decades later, Air Jordans are still a best seller for Nike.The problem for the Oregon company is that teens are pushing back on paying full prices often running into hundreds of dollars. They are also more willing than ever to wear hip Adidas trainers.That is bad news for retailers which peddle Nike’s wares such as Foot Locker, The Finish Line and Dick’s Sporting Goods.Unexpectedly disastrous second quarters at the trio sent their shares down by a quarter on average. A price war may be the only way for Nike and its retailers to prop up market share. But the resulting losses will soon be too much to bear.In the most recent earnings announcements, shoe and sport goods retailers reduced earnings forecasts for upcoming quarters by a whopping one-third, on average. At the same time, mid-tier department stores and discounters which charge somewhat lower prices are reporting improving sales in their sport sections.Research from Morgan Stanley shows that both volume and pricing of Nike shoes fell sharply in July and August in the face of product launches by Adidas.Nike’s edge on Adidas and Under Armour had been unassailable until now. Nike has had to resort to selling some of its assortment at Amazon, hardly a high-margin channel, to keep pace.Nike’s new price realism along with a glut of physical retailers leaves consolidation as the only answer. The most natural combination is Foot Locker and Finish Line whose respective enterprise values are $3.5bn and $300m.The best template may be the golf equipment sector where a similar shakeout began three years ago. Consolidation and shrinkage there has led to a healthier set of survivors with modest growth prospects.It may indeed still “be the shoes” that matter for Americans, but not at any cost.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

80;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-08-28T13:01:55Z;New Fitbit smartwatch and headphones take aim at Apple;Partnership with Adidas marks effort to regain leadership of wearable tech market;Fitbit is teaming up with Adidas as it takes on Apple with its first fully-fledged smartwatch, Ionic, and new wireless headphones. Ionic is the first of what Fitbit chief executive James Park said would be a series of smartwatches, as it looks to regain its position at the top of the wearable technology market, a position that analysts say it has lost to Apple Watch in recent months. The $300 device — which boasts four-day battery life, new wireless music and payment features, and improved GPS and heart-rate tracking — will go on sale in October. Adidas, the German sportswear group, will sell a special edition of Ionic starting early next year, boosting Fitbit’s profile in Europe and Asia. In Fitbit, Adidas has a new ally against Nike, which first partnered with Apple on a customised version of its Watch last year. Adidas lags behind Nike in the US sportswear market but has been gaining share in recent months. Fitbit is banking on Ionic to reverse its declining sales, as simpler fitness trackers reach saturation point in many developed markets. The San Francisco-based company’s revenues this year are expected to fall by as much as a quarter compared with 2016. Ionic’s launch is “definitely a big event in the company’s history”, Mr Park said in an interview. “We’ve rarely entered a new category with this much effort and push behind it.” While the majority of Fitbit’s revenues in the fourth quarter will still come from its earlier products, Mr Park added: “Our entry into smartwatches — and Ionic is not the only product in our smartwatch road map — allows us to re-establish a growth profile for Fitbit looking forward.” [The Ionic’s] upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoeaThe unveiling of Ionic, alongside new Flyer wireless headphones and updated Aria scales, comes ahead of the anticipated new version of the Apple Watch, which is expected to include a cellular wireless connection when it makes its debut next month. Ionic, which unlike an Apple Watch works with both iOS and Android smartphones, features a slimline design that Fitbit says was inspired by the space age. Its upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoea. A colour touchscreen will also offer guided workout sessions, powered by a revamped Fitbit Coach app, and customisable watch faces. Analysts at Gartner estimate that 41.5m smartwatches will be sold globally this year, up 19 per cent from 2016, generating $9.7bn in revenues. The consultancy predicts that smartwatches will be the second best-selling kind of wearable device by 2019, after Bluetooth headsets. Fitbit’s $130 Flyer wireless headphones, which pair automatically with Ionic watches, are designed to be workout friendly with a secure and sweat-proof design. While Flyer headphones, at $130, are cheaper than Apple’s $160 AirPods, the Ionic is at least $30 more expensive than the cheapest available Apple Watch. Gartner estimates the average selling price of a smartwatch is $223. Mr Park believes Ionic can command a premium price because of its four-day battery life (Apple Watch lasts just a day or two), improved GPS reception thanks to “nanomoulding technology” that he says is unique in wearables, and the ability to stream music from Pandora, the internet radio company. Thanks to the acquisitions of Coin and Pebble last year, Fitbit’s watch will also support third-party apps, such as Starbucks and Strava, as well as contactless payments with Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards. Although multi-day battery life means Ionic can track sleep, continuous use of both music and GPS will consume all the device’s power reserves in around 10 hours. Like the Apple Watch, Ionic’s screen remains dark until wearers raise their arm or push a button, in order to lengthen battery life. Customers can order an Ionic starting on August 28, with the first shipments arriving in late September. The device will go on general sale in October.
81;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
82;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Sports Direct takes stake in Debenhams;;Sports Direct has taken a direct stake of more than 10 per cent in Debenhams, becoming the second-largest shareholder in the high street stalwart.Mike Ashley’s sportswear group already held an interest in Debenhams through contracts for difference and put options. However, in regulatory filings on Tuesday, Debenhams revealed that it had converted some of those contracts into a direct shareholding worth 10.54 per cent of the company.Sports Direct’s total voting interest in Debenhams also increased from 20.27 per cent to 21.04 per cent through the addition of further financial instruments.The decision is the latest in a string of similar moves by Sports Direct, which has made a habit of purchasing stakes in well-known brands that have run into difficulty. Last month the group, which is controlled by controversial billionaire Mike Ashley, increased its stake in lossmaking retailer French Connection to 27 per cent, and took a 26 per cent interest in video game specialist Game Digital.Earlier in the year Sports Direct also signalled its intention to expand into the US market by buying two local retailers out of bankruptcy.Like many of its high street peers, Debenhams has struggled in the face of falling foot traffic and the growth of online shopping. Shares in the 239-year old company have fallen more than 28 per cent so far this year, prompting its relegation from the FTSE 250, and has hired former Amazon and Nike executive Sergio Bucher to help turn the business around.Debenhams declined to comment. Sports Direct declined to comment on the specific purchase. However, in Sports Direct’s annual report released last month, Mr Ashley said the group would continue to look for opportunities to “broaden or enhance our commercial relationships or retail channels, selectively grow our market share, and/or further diversify our operations”.Photo: Bloomberg
83;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-08-21T18:14:43Z;Foot Locker plumbs 5-year low as Amazon pain looms;;Foot Locker extended its slump on Monday, dropping another 6.2 per cent following a 28 per cent slide on Friday as analysts hit the athletic footwear chain with more downgrades amid growing questions over the viability of its business model.The stock fell to a near 5-year low of $32.23 after UBS downgraded it and slashed its price target to $37 from $70. Analysts cited Foot Locker’s disastrous second quarter earnings as an early warning sign of the structural changes starting to take place in the sportswear retail industry.UBS’s Michael Binetti said in a note on Monday that as brands such as Nike and Adidas ramp up their push to sell more of their products directly to consumers, third-party retailers like Foot Locker stand to lose the most.In June, Nike announced that it has formed a new partnership with Amazon to sell a limited number of its products on the e-commerce giant’s website. In a call with analysts on Friday, Foot Locker’s chief executive brushed off analysts’ concern about the tie-up, saying the products involved are not the high-end, $100-plus sneakers that make up the bulk of its sales. Instead he blamed fickle consumers, rise of mobile shopping and lack of “innovative new products” for the group’s big earnings miss.“For that reason, we do not believe our vendors selling product directly on Amazon is an imminent threat,” said chief executive Richard Johnson on Friday. “There is no indication that any of our vendors intend to sell premium athletic product directly via that sort of distribution channel.”Mr Binetti thinks Foot Locker might be overly optimistic, citing UBS research showing that consumers, for the first time ever, prefer to buy Nike products on Amazon than at a Foot Locker store.“Market share loss to AMZN is almost certain,” he said. “While we think the brands will continue to highly value their stores as three-dimensional theatres for pinnacle product, FL and (rival retailer Finish Line) FINL do indeed sell high volumes of footwear that we believe will compete for market share with Amazon.”Mr Binetti also argued that given Foot Locker’s high exposure to markets where department stores like Macy’s and JC Penney are closing stores (ie deteriorating malls), the company will most likely need to shutter more shops in the coming years as foot traffic drops.“The combination of an accelerating shift of purchase to both Amazon and the brands’ own website—and the subsequent reduction in purchase intent through athletic specialty retailers like Foot Locker—makes it hard to see the path back to accelerating market share gains for Foot Locker,” he wrote.
84;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;US readies to cash in on solar eclipse;Towns and businesses prepare for a once in a generation economic jolt;Nashville has long been a hotspot for tourists. But the city, a destination for music lovers and more recently bachelor parties, is hoping two cosmic minutes will bring a once in a generation jolt to its economy. Tens of millions of people are set to watch the sun’s corona encircle the moon on Monday, a rare event that will envelope US skies with a band of darkness for no more than 160 seconds. The solar eclipse, which is projected to draw more spectators than any other in US history, is expected to bring millions of dollars to groups ranging from doughnut shops in rural Oregon to corporate behemoths like Walmart. “This is nature’s super bowl,” says Alyssa Ravasio, chief executive of Hipcamp, a start-up that bills itself as the Airbnb of camping. Towns across a 70-mile stretch are in viewing range of the event, and Nashville, the largest city in the path, anticipates between 50,000 and 75,000 visitors will spend up to $20m on Monday. However, “we really can’t compare a once in a lifetime event that’s never happened before”, cautions Heather Middleton from the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. Most official campsites have been booked for months, while Nashville’s hotel occupancy is 48 per cent higher from the same day a year ago. About 12m Americans live in the “path of totality”, while millions are expected to descend upon the path, with tourists from as far as Japan trekking to rural towns in Idaho to catch the moments of darkness.Smaller cities in the eclipse’s path have been preparing for months. Casper, Wyoming, a city of 55,000, has invested $8.5m to build a new town square. Hopkinsville, Kentucky, has marketed itself “eclipseville”. Businesses in smaller towns such as Eugene, Oregon, are churning out eclipse-themed T-shirts and doughnuts. A pair of ultra-dark sunglasses needed to safely view the spectacle have also become a coveted item, with retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Kroger selling the product. Consumer brands are also looking to cash in on the natural phenomenon, with promotions that stretch well beyond novelty shirts. For marketers, the solar eclipse offers an opportunity that even popular television can rarely provide in the digital age: a moment when millions of people will sit and watch an event at the same time. Nature enthusiasts can take a week-long “total-eclipse” cruise, offered by Royal Caribbean, during which Bonnie Tyler will perform “Total Eclipse of the Heart” while passengers watch the sky show by sea. Nike is branding its black shoes as “solar eclipse picks” to “take your looks from day to night to day again”. Krispy Kreme has covered its trademark glazed doughnut in chocolate to resemble the darkness of the eclipse sky.Hipcamp, a site where people can find and rent out campgrounds, has been ramping up a marketing campaign with advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, as the eclipse craze flooded social media in recent months.“It’s funny because we’ve had lots of chances to do marketing around events like Coachella [arts festival], and we’ve always stayed away from that,” says Ms Ravasio. “But this is different. It’s the first solar eclipse to go coast to coast in the US for 99 years . . . for many people it’s the only chance to really grasp the solar system.” Eclipse-driven bookings on Hipcamp are 400 per cent higher than that of any previous big events such as the fourth of July, says Ms Ravasio. To meet, demand Hipcamp has partnered with landowners to add more space, with some people renting out their own front yards as viewing spots. The site has added 1,000 new listings in the past week alone. Ms Ravasio attributes the demand in part to a growing trend among consumers, particularly millennials, who want to “support brands that are environmentally friendly, that make the world a better place, and there’s no easier way to use your dollars for that than this”.
85;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Under Armour launches restructuring after posting quarterly loss;;Shares in Under Armour tumbled nearly 9 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the sportswear maker reported its second straight quarter of losses and launched a major restructuring plan that would slice its 2017 operating profit by half.The Maryland-based company also lowered its full year sales expectations amid tough trading conditions in its important North American market.Under Armour, which rose to prominence on the back of its sneakers partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, has struggled over the past year as the so-called athleisure trend in which sportswear is worn outside of the gym fades.This shift in consumer shopping habit comes even as Under Armour has to contend with an ever growing number of new entrants in the sportswear market. Alongside traditional rivals such as Nike, Adidas and Lululemon, general retailers like Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into atlethicwear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sportsbras.Analysts have also expressed concern that Under Armour spends too much in relation to the revenue it generates – a point that was underscored by the company’s latest results.For the three months to end of June, net revenue rose nearly 9 per cent to $1.08bn, slightly ahead of the $1.07bn the market was expecting. However sharply higher operating costs pushed Under Armour into a loss of $12.3m for the quarter, compared to a profit of $6.3m in the prior year period.In a bid to turn things around, the company said on Tuesday that it will overhaul its business to better respond to shifting consumer tastes and build up its online strategy.“We are utilizing 2017 to ensure that operations across our diverse portfolio of sport categories, distribution channels and geographies are optimised as we are building a stronger, faster and smarter company,” said chief executive Kevin Plank.As a result of the revamp, which will result in $110m-$130m of pre-tax charges, the company now expects operating income for the year to come in between $160m-180m, compared to its previous forecast of $320m.Earnings per share in 2017 will be between 18 cents to 21 cents, compared to the 42 cents analysts had projected.Net revenues meanwhile are expected to grow 9-11 per cent versus the previous expectation of 11-12 per cent growth, “reflecting moderation in the company’s North American business.”
86;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-07-28T07:27:08Z;Adidas shares rise 7% after forecast upgrade;;Adidas was the top performer on the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index on Friday morning, after it followed rivals in upgrading its full-year profit forecasts for the second time this year.Revenues from continuing operations increased 20 per cent year on year in the six months to June, to €5bn. Operating profit of €505m was 18 per cent better than the previous year, when it had benefited from a one-off €70m payment related to Chelsea FC’s shirt sponsorship.As a result of the strong start, Adidas increased its forecasts for both sales and profit growth.Revenues are now expected to increase by between 17 and 19 per cent on a constant currency basis, compared to previous estimates of 12 to 14 per cent growth. Net income from continuing operations is now forecast to increase by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent, double the lower end of its previous estimate of 13 per cent to 15 per cent growth.The results were announced after markets closed on Thursday evening, and shares opened 7.4 per cent higher on Friday morning, at €190.2.Under new chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Adidas has been looking to close the gap with its larger rival Nike, which enjoys significantly stronger profit margins. Its task has been helped by a general enthusiasm for sportswear in recent years, which also enabled its Bavarian neighbour Puma to upgrade its forecasts last week.
87;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-07-27T18:23:43Z;Republicans abandon border-adjustment tax proposal;;"Republican lawmakers have set aside plans for a controversial border-adjusted tax in hopes of smoothing the way for comprehensive tax overhaul.“While we have debated the pro-growth benefits of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform,” according to a statement on Thursday from top Republicans and White House officials including Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives; Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell; Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary; and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council.The statement also underscored Republicans’ commitment to seizing the opportunity — while they control both the Senate and the House, as well as the White House — to push forward with a major overhaul of US tax policy.Under the border-adjusted tax proposal floated earlier this year, companies would no longer be able to deduct the cost of imported goods from their taxable profits, while exports would not be taxable.It has divided the business community, with companies reliant on imports — including retailers like Walmart, Target, Nike and Gap — arguing they would be unfairly penalised, while proponents said it would have boosted investment in the US."
88;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-07-24T18:01:27Z;Sports retailers stumble on bleak Hibbett outlook;;"Shares in sports retailers deflated on Monday after Hibbett Sports, an Alabama-based company, issued a profit warning and a bleak sales outlook, citing “challenging sales trends”.Hibbett Sports shares plummeted 30 per cent to $13.82 and were on track for their biggest one-day loss on record, after the company said it expects comparable sales, a key industry metric, to fall 10 per cent in the second quarter.The company, which also announced the launch of its e-commerce platform on Monday, also warned that “significant pressure on gross margin” is expected to drive a loss of between 19 to 22 cents a share in the same period. That compared to Wall Street estimates for a profit of 15 cents, according to Bloomberg.Hibbett said it would provide additional detail and revised full-year guidance when it announces second quarter results next month.The gloomy outlook was enough to deliver a blow to shares of rival sports retailers.While athleisure, the moniker used for a trend which sees people wear work out gear outside of the gym, had helped certain sports retailers buck some of the broader retail pain, specialty sports retailers have however had a tough time amid great competition from online retailers and brands that were pushing direct-to-consumer sales.The challenging environment has prompted The Sports Authority; Vestis Retail Group, the operator of Sport Chalet; and Michigan Sporting Goods Distributors to all file for bankruptcy protection."
89;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-07-15T12:20:42Z;Resellers pounce on Supreme-Louis Vuitton collaboration;Brands lose control as the internet enables a vibrant secondary market in their goods;When streetwear brand Supreme unveiled its collection with Louis Vuitton last month, young people in London, Los Angeles and Tokyo camped overnight outside stores hoping to snap up the hoodies and T-shirts that had received a stamp of approval from the world’s largest luxury label.Many of these people, however, were lined up with the goal of selling their purchases on the secondary market, where Supreme, with its cult-like following, is among the most highly coveted names.Thousands of items from the collection of jerseys, bags and other goods emblazoned with Supreme’s block logo have ended up on eBay at 1.5 to five times the retail price, according to an FT analysis. The item listed most on eBay is the box logo T-shirt, which has a median asking price of $1,600, more than three times the retail price.Observers say the price disparity reflects not only the hysteria Supreme has for years evoked, but the realities of selling clothes in 2017, as brands globally are losing their grip on pricing and distribution. This can have differing effects as prices can move in both directions: while Supreme’s go up as they are resold, many brands’ prices fall.For decades, big brands have controlled who can sell their goods and for how much. But as third-party sellers have proliferated on sites such as Amazon, prices there are not fixed by brands but by supply and demand, says Whitney Gibson, an attorney at law firm Vorys who works with brands to combat unauthorised resellers.Supreme has opted for a distribution model based on scarcity. Founder James Jebbia has explained: “If we can sell 600, I make 400.” The company, which started as a Manhattan skate shop in 1994, pioneered the “drop” — staggered releases of new garments every week — and does not re-stock its wares, no matter how popular.With reselling and shopping online becoming more common, brands from Nike to consumer goods producer Clorox are trying to be more creative about how they distribute. “[Supreme’s model] is absolutely the direction it’s moving into, which is the overall strategy of exclusivity,” says Josh Luber, founder of StockX, a shoes and accessories trading site. “There’s a more concerted effort to find different ways to leverage limited release products.”Fast fashion retailers such as H&M and Target have rolled out limited edition collaborations with well-known fashion designers. And Nike this year launched a limited release of 46 boxed pairs of basketball shoes endorsed by LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers player. They were sold not through Nike’s website or retailers, but on StockX for up to $11,000 per pair. A broader subsequent release of the same shoes went on retail sale for less than $200.But while Supreme, and a few other luxury labels such as Chanel, attract higher prices on secondary markets, the majority of brands have the opposite problem. Their goods are bought and resold at lower prices, which creates a “downward spiral” on what a brand can charge in a bricks-and-mortar store, says James Thomson, a former business development manager at Amazon.These products, far from being obtained at full price, are often stolen or counterfeit. “If you get your hands on a product because it fell off the back of a truck, you can start selling inventory and nobody is any wiser,” says Mr Thomson. “The most common complaint brands have is, ‘Why is my product always cheaper on Amazon?’ It’s because companies you don’t know are selling your product.”Executives say the resale market has become more mainstream. StockX estimates that reselling of sneakers has tripled in the past three years, with resellers now making $1.5bn annually in the US. “That 14-to-24-year-old sneakerhead who reads Complex [magazine] was always there,” says Mr Luber. But instead of buying the way brands would like him to, the resale sites of the internet are his marketplace.
90;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-06-29T22:03:45Z;Nike announces partnerships with Amazon, Instagram;;Nike on Thursday confirmed rumours that had been afoot for a week, as chief executive Mark Parker said the company was executing a new partnership with Amazon.Nike, which has already been aggressively growing its direct-to-consumer sales, said it will put a limited number of its products on Amazon.“We are looking for way to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling,” Mr Parker said on a conference call with investors. “We are in the early stages but we really look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot”.The company said it will scale the partnership depending on its success.While the retailer’s products already appear on Amazon through third-party sellers and through Amazon’s subsidiary Zappos.com, Goldman Sachs last week outlined the benefits of a formal partnership with Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce juggernaut.While noting that the Oregon-based company “could be close to commencing a direct relationship” with Amazon, the analysts said such a partnership would give Nike more control over how its products are presented and benefit from exposure to its online platform.Nike, which is looking to drive sales growth, also announced a partnership with Instagram that will allow consumers to purchase Nike products seamlessly through the photo-sharing application.“Clearly we are boosting our ability to create new ways to serve consumers making the entire Nike+ ecosystem available to consumers,” brand president Trevor Edwards said.Nike is working to use its direct connection with its consumers to increase sales growth — an area where the company sees a lot of opportunity. The efforts come at a time when specialty sports retailing has seen consolidation after companies like Sports Authority and Vestis Retail Group, the operator of Sport Chalet, both filed for bankruptcy last year.
91;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-06-29T20:49:11Z;Nike shares pop as sales, earnings top Wall Street estimates;;The athleisure trend hasn’t been put to bed just yet. Nike reported strong overseas sales that helped the company post upbeat fourth-quarter earnings and sales.Shares in the Oregon-based company climbed more than 3 per cent to $54.99 after it said profits rose 19 per cent to $1.1bn in the three months ended in May from $846m in the year-ago period. That translated to earnings of 60 cents a share, up from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter, eclipsing Wall Street estimates of 60 cents.Meanwhile, revenues in the fourth quarter climbed 5 per cent from a year ago to $8.7bn, above estimates of $8.63bn. Sales climbed just 1 per cent in North America but were up 16 per cent in China, 18 per cent in other emerging markets and 12 per cent in Western Europe.Sales of footwear, Nike’s largest division, rose 8 per cent year-on-year to $5.47bn and were up 3 per cent sequentially.Nike had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the athleisure trend, which sees people wear workout clothing outside the gym. However, it is facing increasing competition from rivals like Under Armour, and Adidas has been catching up to it in the footwear market. General apparel retailers like Gap have also been pushing into the workout space with Athleta and the Gap Body line. Moreover, some analysts have cautioned that denim is making a comeback and could further weigh on athletic apparel retailers.In an effort to respond to rapidly changing consumer behaviour and overhaul its business, Nike said earlier this month that it would cut 1,400 jobs, 2 per cent of its global workforce. It also plans to create a more localised global business by focusing on 12 key cities including New York, London, Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, and Milan.“Nike continues to create both near-term wins in today’s dynamic environment and a lasting foundation for future growth,” said Mark Parker, chief executive, said on Thursday. “Through our Consumer Direct Offense, we’re putting even more firepower behind our greatest opportunities in fiscal 2018. It will be a big year for Nike innovation and we’ll bring those stories to life through deeper consumer connections in our key cities around the world.”Nike’s shares are up nearly 5 per cent so far this year.

The former hedge fund manager and “pharma bro” infamously raised the price of a life-saving drug for AIDS and cancer patients from $13.50 to $750, bought an exclusive Wu-Tang Clan record for $2m, and then publicly feuded with a member of the rap group.The 34-year old is facing charges of defrauding investors to the tune of $11m after allegedly running his hedge fund as though it were a “Ponzi-like scheme”. Opening arguments could begin as soon as Monday after jury selection and the trial is expected to last about two weeks.US Fed bank stress test – part twoThe Federal Reserve is set to announce the results of the second part of its annual US bank stress test after the market close on Wednesday. In the first round of this year’s stress tests, the Fed found that US banks have big enough capital buffers to keep trading through an economic meltdown. The upbeat results augur well for US banks, which will find out after the market’s close on Wednesday how much capital they can return through dividends and share buybacks.NikeNike is due to issue its fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday. Shares in the US athletic apparel giant have been on a rollercoaster ride over the past two weeks. The stock slumped more than 3 per cent on June 15 after announcing a restructuring that would see it eliminate 2 per cent of its work force. It extended its losses the day after amid a wider retail sector sell-off following news of Amazon’s $13.7bn bid for Whole Foods.The $86bn Oregon-based company regained some ground this week however after analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested Nike “could be close to commencing a direct relationship” to sell its products on Amazon. Investors will have their eyes on any such news and comments on trading conditions. The market is looking for revenue of $8.62bn and adjusted net income of $836.1m or 50 cents a share."
93;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-06-21T16:38:29Z;Possible Nike-Amazon partnership puts sports retailers on the ropes;;A Nike-Amazon dream team? It could happen, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Wednesday, and the suggestion is already pressuring shares of US sports retailers like Foot Locker and Dicks Sporting Goods.Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday that athletic apparel giant Nike “could be close to commencing a direct relationship” to sell its products on Amazon, the e-commerce heavyweight whose forays into groceries and apparel have already struck fear into those respective markets this week.The news sent shares of Dicks Sporting Goods, a US athletic retailer, down 6 per cent. Shares of Foot Locker, a shoe-store chain, fell 6 per cent as well, in addition to a 5.5 per cent slump for another athletic-retail chain Hibbett Sports, as investors contemplated the effects such a deal might have on rivals’ sales of popular Nike products.Currently, plenty of Nike products turn up on Amazon’s retail site — though largely via Amazon Marketplace, a platform for third-party sellers, as well as products that Nike sells to an Amazon subsidiary, shoe-seller Zappos.com.But there are significant advantages to creating a more formal direct relationship with Amazon, like the one Amazon already has with Nike’s athletic apparel rival Under Armour, Goldman says. For one, Nike would get direct exposure to Amazon’s massive and rapidly evolving e-commerce platform, and it would have more control over how its products are presented and sold there.And Nike would also get a more direct line to millennials, who increasingly consider Amazon their preferred destination for fashion purchases. That’s especially true for male millennials, according to a recent Goldman survey, in which they named Amazon as their favourite retailer in all categories except shoes and athletic (their #1 for those categories? Nike.).If a deal is struck, it would be the latest in a string of coups for Amazon, which last week announced plans to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods for $13.7bn. Earlier this week it also said it was launching a try-before-you-buy apparel service, Prime Wardrobe.“We expect Amazon to remain focused on the apparel category and see additional direct relationships with major brands only furthering its momentum in apparel as the category continues to move online,” Goldman analysts wrote.

To speed up product development and cut the lead time needed to get new products on the shelves, it plans to reduce the number of items it sells by 25 per cent.It is also looking to better respond to the latest fashion trends by focusing on 12 key cities: New York, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Seoul and Milan. The company said 80 per cent of its sales growth over the next three years will come from these cities.“The future of sport will be decided by the company that obsesses the needs of the evolving consumer,” said Mark Parker, Nike’s chairman, president, and chief executive.Investors were not impressed and sent shares in the $89bn company down 2.7 per cent to $53.18 in early trading.News of the revamp comes after Nike reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter sales in March. The stock suffered its biggest one-day drop in 19 months in the wake of the results, which showed a sharp slowdown in growth.Nike has fared better than general apparel retailers, many of which have been busy shuttering stores amid sliding sales. The company has benefited from the trend in “athleisure” in which sportswear is worn outside of the gym.But it has also seen an influx of new entrants into a category it once dominated, and these competitors have been quicker and nimbler to react to the latest fashion trends. Alongside competitors Adidas, Under Armour and Lululemon, general retailers such as Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into sportswear with their own lines of high-tech joggers and sports bras.Nike is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on June 29.

The inquiry released its final report in May after examining more than 8,000 contracts from 1,900 companies selling content and consumer goods online across the EU.The commission is concerned that companies may be putting limits on cross-border sales through “geo-blocking” of consumers depending on their location. It is looking into whether companies contractually prevented their licensed suppliers from selling their products to consumers in different member states, which would be anti-competitive.Brussels opened three cases in February examining the markets for consumer electronics and video games as well as the pricing and availability of hotels on websites. A fourth investigation into clothing retailer Guess was started last week.Monique Goyens, director-general of the European Consumer Organisation, said: “The digital single market cannot be a one-way street. Business practices which restrict consumers from choosing the product or service they want to purchase from providers across the EU are incompatible with a single market.”A 2016 commission study estimated that fully eliminating geo-blocking in the EU in the €45bn for just four products — desktop, laptops, tablets and portable computers — would generate a €500m gain for consumers and a €283m gain for producers.Nike said it was aware of the European Commission’s investigation and would continue to co-operate with the authorities. Universal Studios and Sanrio could not be reached for comment."

Brands include Nike’s Barcelona football shirts, Sanrio’s license for Hello Kitty products and Universal’s merchandising rights for animated film “Despicable Me” and “Minions”.The investigation follows Brussels’ move earlier this month to investigate clothing retailer Guess over concerns that it had illegally restricted its suppliers from selling its wares across borders within the EU.Brussels has been on a crackdown against retailers which prevent people buying from websites based in another member state, so called geo-blocking, which is a breach of the EU’s competition rules.“One of the key benefits of the EU’s Single Market is that consumers can shop around for a better deal”, Ms Vestager said earlier this month.Following a wide-ranging antitrust inquiry into the e-commerce sector last year, Europe’s competition watchdog has toughened up on manufacturers and retailers with pricing and distribution policies that create barriers in the internal market, increasing prices or cutting selection for European consumers.It has launched four e-commerce related cases to date. Three were launched in February and are ongoing: pricing restrictions of consumer electronics; limits on cross border sales of video games and national differences in pricing and availability of hotels on websites."
98;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-04-11T18:41:59Z;JD Sports hits its stride in fashionable shift to athleisure;Jaeger demise and sports retailer’s ascent says a lot about the high street;Coco Chanel said fashion changes but style endures. And it is true that the culture of clothing changes slowly.The juxtaposition of Jaeger’s collapse and JD Sports Fashion’s 30 per cent rise in sales to £2.4bn and its 50 per cent rise in pre-nasties profits to £245m says a lot about what has happened to the high street over recent decades.Jaeger‘s crepe skirts and tweed trews hark back to a time when adults wore plimsolls to play tennis and only school kids wore gym kits. The business, founded in 1884 as “Dr Jaeger’s Sanitary Woollen System Co Ltd”, crumpled into administration this week because today’s grannies wear trackies and yoga pants, just like their grandkids.All generations now shop for clothes online and run from the gym to the bar on the high street. But the shift has taken longer than you think.Peter Cowgill set up JD Sports Fashion in 1983 just as Reebok came out with its first casual shoes with soft uppers. Even then sales of trainers were slow to take off. JD’s best seller in the 1980s was the Pringle sweater. A decade later, JD Sports was still struggling. There weren’t enough so-called athleisure products to sell, Mr Cowgill says. He had to wait till 2000 before Lululemon set up its first store selling sweat pants and yoga wear. JD only started retailing Nike leggings a decade or so ago.Now, the cultural shift seems complete. Nike talks about revenues of $50bn by 2020. Investec forecasts that JD Sports, which has closely tied itself to the big athleisure brands, will be turning over about £3bn by then and making pre-tax profits of £304m a year. However, that puts the retailer on a heady 17 times earnings. That assumes Mr Cowgill, as executive chairman, will continue to keep ahead of the pack.Athleisure will endure (although Coco might have protested that it has style). But that doesn’t mean JD Sports won’t make fashion faux pas.Some companies, like some people, do better in times of crisis. Winston Churchill, whose face appears on the new polymer £5 bank note, was one. De La Rue, which prints the £5 note, may be another. The 200-year-old business, set up by a Guernsey printer a year before the battle of Waterloo, said on Tuesday it would more than match analysts’ full-year expectations for operating profits of £66.4m. Net debt will also be better than expected at £120m because of strong cash generation. The shares bounced 7 per cent to 663p.Bank notes, it seems, are selling well for all the rise in electronic payment systems. De La Rue’s authentication products and anti-counterfeiting measures — the holograms that feature in passports and tax stamps on bottles of booze — are doing even better. If Brits have to revert to blue passports as a result of Brexit, Citi reckons it will add £200m to revenues, which are expected to be about £475m next year.Martin Sutherland, brought in as chief executive two and a bit years ago, is halfway through a five-year plan to turn the company round after a series of profit warnings. He has cut costs and printing capacity, and acquired higher-margin businesses involved in authentication and tracing. That will cushion De La Rue from the lumpy, unpredictable nature of printing money.Nonetheless, 70 per cent of De La Rue’s sales still come from designing, producing paper and polymer and printing bank notes.Sterling’s weakness has also been a mixed blessing. It has lifted revenues — 80 per cent of which are non-UK — but also raised raw materials costs.De La Rue has a long way to go before it returns to better times when its shares traded above 800p. At £66m, operating profits will still be down on last year. They are not forecast to return to 2015-16 levels for another two years. That makes the group’s shares, which trade at 14 times forecast earnings, look pricey.Just because a company has a licence to print money, it doesn’t mean it can do so profitably.Jon Moulton’s Better Capital has had better days. The assets in its 2012 fund are down close to 40 per cent in five years. The shares are down 75 per cent. This is the fund that bought Jaeger, now in administration, for about £20m in 2012 and invested a further £49m or so. It managed to recoup £7m by selling its debt to a mystery shopper at the end of March.The fund also owned City Link, the parcel delivery business it bought for £1 from Rentokil in 2014 which went into administration within a year. It still owns Everest, the double-glazing business, and Spot, the stationers. Both have been written down. CAV Aerospace “entered into, and left, a pre-packaged insolvency process” last year. Intertain, the bar business, is the best of the bunch having been recently sold for £38m against a cost of £23m.Better Capital has so far bought back half the shares in the fund from investors. Why not more?kate.burgess@ft.com
99;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-03-24T15:16:53Z;Under Armour shares perk up on Jefferies upgrade;;Under Armour shares jogged higher on Friday after analysts at Jefferies upgraded the stock citing data from a survey that shows the brand has strengthened and arguing that “overly-negative sentiment creates a buying opportunity”.Shares in the Maryland-based retailer rose 4 per cent to $18.13 — its biggest one-day gain since December — after analysts at Jefferies lifted their rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold” and raised their price target to $27, from $19 previously.That helped the bull camp on Wall Street grow, giving the stock its eighth “buy” rating. Under Armour has 22 “hold” ratings and 5 “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.Jefferies refreshed its survey of 2,000 consumers across the US and found that compared to three years ago, they have greater recognition of the Under Armour brand and think it is less expensive.40 per cent polled this time around thought Under Armour was expensive, compared with 62 per cent three years ago, the survey found. “We view survey responses related to perceived affordability as equally favourable, and indicative of consumers attaching a greater view of value to UA product for the price paid,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said.Moreover, while Under Armour did lose market share to Adidas last year — 18 per cent said Under Armour was the brand of athletic apparel the most liked to wear, compared with 21 per cent for Adidas, compared with 20 per cent and 13 per cent respectively three years ago.Mr Konik also said Adidas’ share gains are peaking.Companies like Under Armour, Nike, and Lululemon have in recent years been beneficiaries of the so-called athleisure trend that sees people wear work out gear even when they are not exercising. And there has been some concern about slowing momentum in athleisure as denim appears to be making a comeback.But the survey also showed that compared to three years ago nearly double the respondents had purchased athletic apparel in the past 12 months. And 10 per cent more wear athletic apparel while not physically active at least four to five times a week. And he argues that the company’s lifestyle assortment with tailored jackets and streamlined trousers could “highlight a new opportunity theoretically broader than even athletic”.Finally, Mr Konik notes that Under Armour is the most heavily-shorted stock in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index, with 24.4 per cent of the float sold short, as the company has posted downbeat results and lowered guidance over the past two quarters. But he sees many avenues for growth at Under Armour, especially overseas and in women’s categories, and argues that the company stands to benefit from proposed tax reforms.“Current trading levels are unwarranted, particularly given other brands (e.g., Adidas) have traded higher with worse fundamentals,” he said.The once high-flying company has seen its fall nearly 33 per cent so far this year, on top of a 30 per cent drop in 2016.
100;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-03-22T16:29:56Z;Nike shares drop as future orders lose ground;;Is Nike starting to lose steam in the race to dominate athletic apparel, or gearing up to pull ahead? Investors sent the sneaker giant’s shares down on Wednesday after it unveiled a mixed bag of indicators about its future performance.Nike shares extended the fall they started on Tuesday after revealing quarterly sales that missed Wall Street’s estimates. During a subsequent call with analysts, executives said that Nike brand future orders were down 4 per cent, or 1 per cent on a constant currency basis, compared to the same time last year.As investors parsed the results, they sent the company’s shares down more than 6 per cent on Wednesday.The quarterly results underscore investors’ concerns that rivals like Adidas and Under Armour are gaining on Nike, a long-time leader in the market for trainers and athletic apparel. Future orders, meanwhile, give a hint at how the company’s performance may take shape over the upcoming months.While acknowledging that futures “are an important part of our operating model,” Nike chief financial officer Andrew Campion told analysts that “futures growth is no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth” for several reasons, including its current focus on increasing profitability, ramping up innovation both in terms of product offerings and its supply chain and improving digital platforms in order to pivot more quickly in response to rapidly shifting consumer taste.Mr Campion said that the company is targeting “continued revenue growth across all geographies in fiscal year 2018″. That is expected to be fueled particularly by international markets like China, where the opportunity is “massive”, with the number of marathons growing 500 per cent over five years and a projected sports economy valued at $850bn by 2025, according to Nike brand president Trevor Edwards.Some analysts agreed with Nike’s relative shrug-off of future orders in favour of focusing on its projected revenue growth.Simeon Siegel of Instinet Equity Research said that “sales guidance has been a better approximator of actual sales growth” in all but a few recent quarters, noting that the spread between the 3 per cent sales growth in North America this quarter versus the 4 per cent decline in future orders from the previous quarter “represented the largest spread” between the two figures “in years.”Jefferies equity analyst Randal Konik said that his team is “not concerned” about the futures orders figures “as the metric is increasingly less correlated with total growth”. With athletic and sporting-goods one of the few retail sectors to buck the general malaise infecting North American apparel companies, he added that Nike “remains in the best position to win” as it sees Adidas starting to cede market share in the running-shoes category to Nike.Credit Suisse analysts said the tepid quarterly earnings suggested that “investment in brand building and innovation are taking longer to take hold than we had previously hoped.” Nevertheless, its investment strategy “supports our long-term thesis that Nike can return to high-single digit revenue growth and teens EPS (earnings per share) growth” as it starts to reap the benefits of a shift away from retail foot traffic and towards direct-to-consumer marketing and sales, which offer the potential for higher margins.
101;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-03-21T21:00:27Z;Nike revenue falls short of estimates as rivals eye its turf;;Nike shares ticked downward on Tuesday after its quarterly sales failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations, another reminder about the pressure it faces from rival sportwear brands on a global scale.Nike said quarterly revenue for the three-month period ending February 28 rose 5 per cent to $8.4bn, a whisker shy of the $8.47bn expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Following the miss — a reminder of the pressure that competitors like Adidas and Under Armour are putting on Nike’s position in the sportswear sector — the company’s shares fell more than 1 per cent in after-hours trading.During the quarter, net income came in at $1.14bn, a 20 per cent increase from the same period a year earlier and above the $881m forecast by analysts. Diluted earnings per share also posted a solid beat over the 52.5 cents expected, increasing 24 per cent to 68 cents.Nike chief executive and chairman Mark Parker credited its “diverse, global portfolio” for “another solid quarter of growth and profitability,” with an increase in apparel sales across Nike, as well as a more modest uptick in footwear sales, offsetting a drop-off in equipment sales. Revenues were up 7 per cent on a currency-neutral basis to $7.9bn, boosted by double-digit growth in western Europe, China and other emerging markets, as well as its sportswear and Jordan brand.Nike’s once-dominant position in athletic footwear and apparel has been under increasing fire in recent years, as more companies attempt to elbow into its territory. Mr Parker said that the company was focused on delivering more innovation in terms of its performance and styles, as well as connecting more directly with customers through digital channels and membership platforms.Over the past 12 months, Nike shares have fallen 9.7 per cent.
102;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;China’s fitness boom energises sportswear brands;Sales growth spurred by ‘athleisure’ trend and government-backed exercise push;Property marketer Lobo Zhang joined a gym for the first time last year, adding to his collection of trainers and helping Chinese sportswear sales to climb at twice the rate of clothing and footwear in general.China is in the grip of a government-backed exercise boom, boosting local sportswear brands and the likes of Adidas and Nike, which are gaining market share on the back of consumer upgrading and an embrace of the “athleisure” fashion trend.Adidas this month said its sales in greater China rose 28 per cent last year — the fastest pace of any region, adding to net global profit growth of more than 60 per cent, while Nike reported “double-digit” sales growth in China in its most recent quarter. Greater China is the second-largest market for both brands, which together account for about a third of the country’s sportswear sales.The country’s importance to Nike was highlighted last week when it expressed “severe regret” after state-broadcaster CCTV reported it had inaccurately advertised some of its shoes — although only 300 pairs were implicated.Sportswear sales in China rose 11 per cent last year to Rmb187bn ($27bn), according to consultancy Euromonitor. By contrast, sales of overall apparel climbed just 5 per cent.Analysts say that Nike, Adidas and New Balance, which command higher prices than local brands, are viewed by Chinese consumers more as fashion labels than sportswear. “Global brands are still very strong in shaping fashion trends especially in the female market,” says Spencer Leung, an analyst at UBS. Their sales growth stems from consumers upgrading as incomes rise, as well as the growing acceptance of sportswear in leisure and work settings.General fashion companies are feeling the shift. Belle International Holdings, the country’s second-largest footwear company by sales, said its 2016 shoe sales slid 9 per cent year on year, while trainers revenue jumped 16 per cent. “Athleisure is the only footwear type that bucks the trend,” says Sheng Baijiao, Belle chairman, adding that people increasingly dress down in the office.Local brands, still widely perceived as copying design innovations from overseas, are also benefiting, with their sales increasing rapidly as more Chinese take up exercise. Gym membership in the country has doubled since 2008 to 6.6m last year, according to the China Business Research Academy. Running has become a popular pastime, with more than 100 marathons held last year compared with 51 in 2014. Yoga practitioners are estimated to have grown from 4m in 2009 to more than 10m today.The ruling Communist party has also boosted the uptake of sports. Facing an epidemic of obesity-related diabetes and other lifestyle-associated illnesses, China’s government has pledged that the number of football pitches across the country will rise from roughly 50,000 to 70,000 by 2020 — by which time it aims to have increased sports venue area per capita from 1.6 to 1.8 square metres. “People themselves are getting into exercise, so government initiatives are really helping the trend to accelerate,” says Matthew Crabbe, analyst at Mintel, the research group.Analysts say the fitness phenomenon is of greater benefit to mid-market local brands, as consumers favour value and functionality over fashion statements when exercising. Mr Zhang says he purchased jogging pants and T-shirts from Anta — a mid-priced label that is China’s third most popular — along with a gym membership.Anta said last month its 2016 net profit jumped 17 per cent year on year to a record high of Rmb2.4bn ($347m). Operating profit margins for the year stood at 24 per cent, compared with roughly 14 per cent for Nike and 8 per cent for Adidas. The company received publicity from sponsoring China’s 2016 Olympic team, and a revenue boost from sales of the higher-prestige Italian Fila brand, whose Chinese distribution rights it acquired in 2009. Even as the market expands, margins are under pressure from the rise of ecommerce in China, a boon for consumers that has pushed brands to cut prices in the face of more transparent competition. “In the past year you have seen prices that are quite low . . . international brands do markdowns quickly,” says Chen Ke, a partner at Roland Berger. The relative losers in this spate of upgrading and exercising will be the lowest-end Chinese brands, Mr Chen says. He expects annual growth of less than 3 per cent for these groups, compared with overall market growth of 8 per cent, over the next five years.Future momentum for Nike and Adidas sales could also be dented by competition from niche upstarts such as Under Armour, which achieved revenues of roughly $180m in China last year. Lululemon, the Canadian yoga brand, is catching on among wealthy urbanites and has opened stores in Beijing and Shanghai. “The upper end, not necessarily more expensive but more unique companies targeting millennials are the ones growing faster,” says Weiwen Han, partner at Bain.Additional reporting by Xia Keyu
103;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-02-16T15:13:19Z;FA nets record revenues despite Euro 2016 humiliation;English football’s governing body gets kick out of broadcasting and kit contracts;England’s football team reached a sporting nadir after being knocked out of the European Championships by Iceland last summer. But the nation’s shortlived participation in the tournament helped the Football Association to achieve record revenues.English football’s governing body said last season’s finances were boosted by the national team competing in Euro 2016, as well as the completion of a number of deals, including the sale of broadcasting and naming rights for the FA Cup and a new kit contract with Nike.On Thursday, the FA reported turnover of £370m in the year ended July 31 2016, an increase of £52m from a year earlier. Though the organisation did not give details on the value of its commercial contracts, it said broadcasting income was the FA’s largest revenue stream.In October, the FA sold a six-season broadcast deal starting from the 2018-19 season for the FA Cup, the club knockout competition, to sports rights agencies Pitch International and IMG. Reports suggest the deal was worth about $1bn.The FA said the deal meant that domestic and international television rights for the English national team and the FA Cup were tied up until 2021, which would ensure “financial stability in the medium term”.Last year, the FA reached a 12-year extension to its contract with Nike worth at least £400m, which means the English men and women’s teams will wear the US sportswear manufacturer’s kit until 2030.Martin Glenn, chief executive, said: “We are delighted to be in such strong financial health . . . this allows us to invest even more money than ever before back into every level of our national game.”The organisation runs on a not-for-profit basis, with its model designed to invest surpluses back into the development of the sport at grassroots level.Those investments rose by £8m to £125m last season, after the FA secured a profit after tax of £7m, up from a £9m loss during the same period a year earlier.The FA has come under attack by politicians in recent weeks. Earlier this month, it was subject to a motion of no confidence by the UK parliament. MPs called for reforms to the FA’s structure, in particular the need to diversify its 12-strong board and 121-member ruling council, which are both dominated by white men.Greg Clarke, appointed FA chairman last August, has said he would resign if he was unsuccessful in transforming its leadership structure within the coming months.
104;NKE;Nike Inc;2017-01-25T11:23:46Z;Our teenagers are Supreme fashion traders;Streetwear brands are leading a boom in the digital reselling of clothes;"If you want to meet a ruthless financial trader, here is my advice. Forget the City of London or Wall Street; simply walk upstairs, knock on a bedroom door and say hello to your teenager.To judge by the experiences of friends and acquaintances with their offspring, there is a fair chance that yours is a market veteran. His or her asset class is not fixed income, equities or commodities but clothes and shoes.You may wonder what they do on their phones all day. They could be idly spending time on Snapchat and Instagram with friends but they are equally likely to be monitoring their Ebay or Depop accounts, trading Supreme hoodies and Palace caps.Kids have always been traders, of course: badges, sweets, vinyl records. But there is something impressive, if rather unnerving, about the scale on which these operate, and their financial and technological acumen.Simon Beckerman, founder of Depop, a London-based trading app, tells of a friend whose 14-year-old daughter needed money to buy herself a pair of shoes. She saw a necklace on Ebay that she believed was too cheap, so she took a screenshot of it and placed her own advertisement for the same item at a higher price on Depop.When someone bid for the necklace on Depop she filled the order by buying it on Ebay and arranging for it to be sent directly to her Depop buyer. She made her shoe money by selling jewellery she had never worn and did not own: give that young woman a job in arbitrage trading at Goldman Sachs.Clothes trading is not confined to teenagers: it has become common among adults, especially women. Reselling has expanded from Ebay to dedicated US sites and apps such as ThredUp and Poshmark, which encourage users to offload unwanted and “gently worn” or “preloved” items.A surprising amount has not been worn at all: it was bought on a whim or was an unwanted gift. ThredUp estimates that 70 per cent of the average American woman’s wardrobe is unused and technology has made it easier to exploit this asset: Poshmark has 2.5m adult users, who upload $4m of inventory for sale each day.But teenagers differ from older generations in the native ease with which they buy and sell clothes, often displaying photos of themselves wearing items they have just bought in order to sell them. Apps such as Instagram and Depop have eroded the barrier between ownership and marketing.Teenage fashion is at the cutting edge of the trading boom — a subculture in which batches of clothes and shoes are bought mainly to make profits from reselling. The most liquid market is streetwear by skateboard brands such as Supreme and Palace, along with cult Adidas and Nike shoes.The key is the “drop” — a sales technique pioneered by Supreme, a brand founded in Manhattan in 1994 that has become a trendsetter in fashion and distribution. You will have encountered a drop if you have passed one of Supreme’s shops in Los Angeles, London, Paris and Japan and witnessed lines of (mostly) young men lining up to buy a new batch of items inside.Supreme produces seasonal collections but drops them gradually instead of releasing them all at once. It does not declare publicly what will be in its shops each week — aficionados must check blogs and closed Facebook groups such as The Basement to find out. All this is finely calculated to create a sense of scarcity — one hoodie sold for $150 in Supreme shops in December but fetched $1,000 at resale.Supreme’s influence is spreading. Nike this month launched a limited release of 46 boxed pairs of basketball shoes endorsed by LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers player. They were sold to benefit his team’s foundation on StockX, a sports shoe trading site, where they sold for up to $11,000 per pair. The same styles went on retail sale this week for less than $200.Such tactics are starting to make the clothing industry work like the financial one: instead of prices being fixed by sellers, they are influenced by supply and demand on exchanges. Brands attempt to stimulate excitement by keeping a tight rein on supply, as fast fashion retailers such as H&M and Zara do with limited edition collections by well-known fashion designers.Do not feel sorry for the teenagers who are thus manipulated by brands. Those I know are capable of striking hard bargains. Unlike their parents, they were born into a world of liquid markets and price transparency: they know precisely what to spend.This view was reinforced this week by talking to two of them. One, a Supreme fan in London, is sceptical about its collaboration with Louis Vuitton. The fact that a rebellious brand is now popular with children from wealthy families also makes him wonder if it is drifting.The other, a 15-year-old veteran of shoe trading, spoke from her school bus in Brooklyn. She no longer believes in lining up outside shops for most drops, calculating that the resale profit is often no more than the minimum wage per hour of waiting.Who knows what they will be buying or selling by next year but one thing is clear: the kids will be all right.john.gapper@ft.com"
105;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-12-20T21:45:43Z;Nike shares bounce after earnings beat on profits, sales;;Nike posted better-than-expected profits and sales thanks in part to strong overseas businesses in western Europe, China and emerging markets despite battling headwinds from a strong US dollar.The company’s shares jumped 3 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following its release of earnings from the three-month period ending November 30.Nike said that its revenues were up 8 per cent from the same period a year earlier to $8.2bn, marginally better than the $8.1bn predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Diluted earnings per share were up 11 per cent from the prior year to 50 cents on net income of $842m. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 43 cents on net income of $734.9m.The company attributed its quarterly performance to strong global consumer demand. It cited double-digit currency-neutral growth for its Nike brand products in western Europe, greater China and emerging markets, as well as in its sportswear and running categories. Sales in its biggest market, North America, increased 3 per cent during the past three-month period.The strong showing from Nike comes as trend-setters are increasingly seeking out “athleisure” gear that combines style with functionality. Sales from its footwear division grew 5 per cent from a year ago to $4.82bn, the company said. Nevertheless, the company’s shares have declined 20 per cent compared to a year earlier, and investors have grown wary after it recently disclosed downbeat future orders and a drop in its gross margin.“Nike’s ability to attack the opportunities that consistently drive growth over the near and long term is what sets us apart,” Nike chairman, president and chief executive Mark Parker said. He said the company was poised to “carry our momentum into the back half of the fiscal year and beyond.”
106;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

However, the signatories have urged him to reconsider.Matt Patsky, chief executive of Trillium Asset Management, the US investment firm, said the business community’s support for policies to address global warming “cannot be reversed and cannot be ignored by the Trump administration”.“That train has left the station and to stand in its way is folly,” he said.[Policies to address global warming] cannot be reversed and cannot be ignored by the Trump administrationMichael Kobori, vice-president of sustainability at Levi Strauss, the clothing company, said that “now more than ever” it was important to back the Paris deal.Such comments underline the concern that Mr Trump’s election has cast over the Marrakesh talks, but also a sense of determination among China, the EU and other nations to press on with plans to curb emissions, no matter what Mr Trump does.John Kerry, outgoing US secretary of state, tried to reassure delegates on Wednesday that millions of Americans were still dedicated to tackling global warming.“No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the US who know climate change is happening and our determination to keep our commitments that were made under Paris,” he said in Marrakesh.“One of the things I’ve learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you are actually in office, compared to when you’re on the campaign trail.”Still, the incoming Trump administration is widely expected to slash many of the climate actions President Barack Obama had promised for the Paris deal, raising questions about whether other countries will be willing or able to fill the gap left by a US withdrawal.It is also unclear how other large companies will respond to the new administration.The list of business groups urging Mr Trump to keep faith with the Paris accord did not include many prominent companies that backed climate change efforts before his election, including Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks.Organisers of the list, which included Ceres, a non-profit sustainability group, said these companies had been approached but their absence did not suggest opposition because the initiative had been done in a matter of days.The Paris deal, sealed in December by almost every nation, requires countries to come up with a plan to curb climate change and progressively update it so global temperature rises compared with pre-industrial times are kept “well below” 2C, and 1.5C if possible.The World Meteorological Organisation said this week that it was 95 per cent certain that 2016 would be the warmest year since records began in the 19th century.While this year’s warming has come on the back of a powerful El Niño weather event, the WMO also said it had been accompanied by a spate of extreme weather, Arctic ice melting and heatwaves that had rarely been seen before.

Chelsea’s deal with the German apparel maker had been worth £300m over 10 years, but club executives concluded that this was significantly below market value.To break away from its Adidas contract, which was due to run until 2023, the English club incurred a penalty about €50m, which it will recoup several times over with its new deal with Nike.

They had been down as much as 16.6 per cent – a sub-par debut in the non-golfing sense of the word.The Japan-headquartered company’s initial public offering was priced at HK$10 per share, which was toward the higher end of its HK$8.46 to HK$10.98 float price range.The listing – the fifth-largest golf IPO on record, according to Dealogic – raised about $160m for the company, and it plans to spend the cash on acquisitions and promotion via sales and marketing.Honma listed on Japan’s Jasdaq over-the-counter market in 1995 but struggled in the 1990s after buying Japanese golf courses itself. By 2005 the company went bust, its founding family ceded control and it was delisted in Japan.In 2009 the company was bought by Liu Jianguo, a Chinese businessman who, according to Honma’s prospectus, wanted “to restore Honma’s status as an elite golf brand and also power it into Japan’s New Corporate Generation — a new generation of energetic, innovative and well-managed Japanese companies.”The company is known for making the most expensive clubs in the world, according to Forbes, and is pinning its hopes on the Chinese market, the sport’s fifth-largest, and fastest-growing, market.That could be a hard sell, as swinging a set of 24-carat gold-plated and platinum clubs may set off alarm bells given Beijing’s national crackdown on corruption over the past few years.In its prospectus, Honma cites China’s crackdown as a risk factor for the company.“If public perception of golf continues to be tainted by corruption cases, demand for
our products in China could be adversely affected,” the company said.Honma isn’t the only golf company with IPO ambitions. Acushnet, the golfing equipment company behind brands such as Titleist golf balls and Footjoy shoes, in June flagged its intention to list in the US.But clouds have been forming over the golf market in general. Both Nike and Adidas have this year decided to exit the golf equipment businesses, and the game itself is being challenged by cycling as the preferred choice for corporate networkers.A mooted $1.4bn buyout of one of Japan’s biggest golf course owners, Accordia Golf, by South Korea’s MBK Partners would have faced a challenge in the form of many elderly players in Japan abandoning the game, but the deal had reportedly been shelved.Photo courtesy of Honma"
111;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-09-28T20:44:09Z;Nike retreats on competition pressures;S&P 500 energy sector advances 4.3 per cent, buoyed by a rally in crude prices;Nike shares slipped on Wednesday after it said an important metric was rising at a slower rate than Wall Street forecast, sparking concerns that the group could be facing pressure from tougher competition.The Oregon-based company said futures orders, seen as a forward-looking indicator of sales, rose 1 per cent in North America, Nike’s biggest unit, as of August 31.The figure missed expectations of a 5 per cent rise and marks a slowdown from the 6 per cent pace it reported as of May 31.The news added to worries that competitors such as Under Armour and Adidas may be pressuring the blue-chip maker of athletic apparel.“With athletics being one of the few spaces in retail that is expanding, more and more players are looking to get into, or expand, (into) athletic apparel and footwear,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst at FBR.Analysts also said Nike’s decision to exit the golf equipment business could have weighed on its results.The shares closed down 3.8 per cent at $53.25, deepening the year-to-date loss to 14.8 per cent.Despite the gloomy performance this year, many analysts continued to strike an upbeat tone.“We continue to see Nike to be a beneficiary of secular tailwinds from both growing global concern for fitness and increasing casualisation of fashion”, said Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel.Echoing that view, Simeon Siegel at Nomura said that “despite the threat from a push by competition and disappointing futures (orders), we view Nike’s scale and dominance as a long-term barrier to entry”.Overall, Nike said its sales climbed 8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to August 31 to $9.06bn, beating expectations of $8.87bn.Net profits advanced to $1.25bn, or 73 cents a share, from $1.18bn, or 67 cents a share. That also beat estimates of 56 cents.Elsewhere, AT&T was also in the red after UBS reduced its rating on the telecommunications group to “neutral” from “buy”.UBS cut its forecast for earnings per share for 2016, 2017 and 2018 by 3 per cent due to increased competition in the wireless industry, and the costs associated with AT&T’s rollout of the DirecTV Now streaming television service.The shares fell 1.5 per cent to $40.85, cutting the 12-month rise to 27.9 per cent.Cintas, the maker of work uniforms, lifted its profit outlook.The company forecast earnings on continuing operations of $4.55-$4.63 a share in its current fiscal year, from a previous estimate of $4.35-$4.45. The rosier outlook came on the back of what Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger described as “another solid quarter”.Its shares rose 2.4 per cent to $116.17.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 0.5 per cent to 2,171.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 18,339.2, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 5,318.6.Energy shares climbed the most in more than eight months on Wednesday after Opec agreed to the need to cut production for the first time in eight years.The S&P 500 energy sector advanced 4.3 per cent, buoyed by a rally in crude prices.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 5.1 per cent to $48.31, while West Texas Intermediate, the US oil standard, rose 4.5 per cent to $46.67, after the 14-member group reached a consensus that production cuts are needed to support prices and rebalance the market at their informal meeting in Algiers.

Futures orders in China grew 19 per cent, but were just shy of expectations.Nike also said profits rose to $1.25bn or 73 cents a share in the three months ended in August, compared with $1.2bn or 67 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales rose 8 per cent to $9.1bn.Analysts were looking for earnings of 56 cents a share, on sales of $8.9bn.The company however said that its gross margin declined by 2 percentage points to 45.5 per cent as a result of one-time factors like foreign exchange, the company’s decision to exit the golf business and a higher mix of off-price goods in its sales.Nike has benefitted from the so-called athleisure trend that sees people wear work out gear outside the gym. But the company has also faced increasing competition from rivals Under Armour and Adidas.Nike shares have declined more than 11 per cent so far this year.

Aeropostale operated more than 800 stores at the start of the year, primarily in the US, according to filings with US securities regulators.The group has already shuttered more than 100 stores.The company has launched cut rate sales to liquidate merchandise, and will likely keep 229 stores open, a person familiar with the deal said. Retailers across the US have struggled to reinvigorate sliding profits, as competition intensifies from fast fashion chains like H&M and Zara and athletic apparel outfitters such as Nike.

This pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap shop does not provide the succour of retail therapy. Working there gets lower marks still. Harsh and unfair working conditions in its warehouses have marred the company’s reputation. An equity market soured by this, and concerned at rising costs, has shunned the shares. Yet — unless the pound falls much further — plenty of pain is already priced in.Bad news comes cheap for Sports Direct these days. Corporate governance looks wanting. Founder and deputy chairman Mike Ashley owns 55 per cent. His deep influence mocks the non-executive chairmanship of Keith Hellawell.Criticism of Sports Direct working practices has brought the board’s impotence to the fore, culminating in a haranguing by a parliamentary select committee. That led to a promise to raise wages. Overheads have duly risen as a percentage of sales. A weaker pound since the Brexit vote only adds to pressure on margins. Nearly 80 per cent of its sales are in the UK. Though Sports Direct does not reveal import figures, half of its goods are sourced in US dollars, the rest from brands such as Nike that manufacture outside Britain.Yet, as all shoppers know, there is a price for everything. On a valuation of just 12 times estimated earnings, the shares look historically cheap even after analysts have knocked down profits estimates. And earnings per share could get a boost. A buyback programme of up to 5 per cent of shares has begun. That could double without board approval, thinks Liberum; the last programme, between 2007 and 2009, lifted Mr Ashley’s holding a lot. Buybacks do not add value; they can signal, though (Mr Ashley later sold shares at a profit). Finally, should the pound’s recent rally continue, Sports Direct’s margins should recover some.Mr Ashley likes a bargain. The share buyback offers one. Get in line.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
115;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-09-02T22:00:41Z;Lululemon’s 2016 rally pegged back;US stocks rally but shares of cruise ship operators face sell-off;Lululemon shares recorded their biggest one-day drop this year after the US maker of yoga apparel reported a key sales metric that came in shy of analysts’ forecasts in the second quarter.Shares in Lululemon fell 10.6 per cent to $68.57 after the retailer said its total like-for-like sales, which include both comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, rose by 5 per cent on a constant currency basis in the quarter to the end of July. Analysts had forecast a rise of 5.9 per cent.The weak sales figure accompanied upbeat earnings. Net income climbed to $53.6m, or 39 cents a share, compared with $47.7m, or 34 cents a share, in the same period in 2015. That topped expectations for 38 cents a share.Net revenues rose 14 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $514.5m, just shy of expectations for $514.7m. But notably, the company said its inventories declined 1 per cent.Despite the sell-off in Lululemon shares, analysts took a more positive view on the results.“Although the reaction to shares is hardly a surprise given lofty expectations and a lighter than hoped for comp, the two-year trend actually accelerated and the quality of the [comparable sales] was hard to ignore as it came with 360bps of product margin improvement, a clear [gross margin] inflection,” Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura, said.Mark Altschwager, an analyst at Baird noted that “earnings acceleration” is firmly under way.Indeed, Lululemon, has come a long way since 2013 when the retailer recalled its signature yoga pants amid controversy they were transparent, and Chip Wilson, its chief executive, resigned over remarks apparently blaming women for the problem. The company, like Nike and Under Armour, has benefited from the “athleisure” trend in which people increasingly wear sports gear outside the gym.Friday’s decline, which trimmed Lululemon’s year-to-date gains to 30.7 per cent, came alongside a rally in US stocks.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,179.9 as investors digested soft US jobs numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 18,491.9, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 5,249.9.Elsewhere, the shares of cruise ship operators sustained a wave of selling on the back of a bearish note from Morgan Stanley.A survey of travel agents indicated that “although the Caribbean and in particular Alaska enjoyed a strong summer, booking momentum for the rest of 2016 and 2017 seems to have slowed somewhat”, analyst Jamie Rollo at Morgan Stanley said.“Almost universally, the panel (of agents) mentioned falling rates, growing promotions, and rising agent incentives, which given sluggish volumes likely indicate general demand weakness rather than operators attempting to build a base of business,” Mr Rollo added.Further, “a few” travel agents said that concerns about the Zika virus were “having a small impact, though the cruise lines have denied this”.The signs of “rough seas” prompted Mr Rollo to cut his view on Carnival Corp to “underweight”. The group’s stock was off by 4.7 per cent to $46.39 on Friday. Fellow cruise-ship operator Royal Caribbean Cruises declined by 3.7 per cent to $70.01.
116;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-08-31T04:29:19Z;Social media celebrities warned on sponsorship disclosure;Consumer protection agencies want online stars to reveal when they are paid for backing products;The UK’s consumer protection agency is warning celebrities that it will take further action if they continue to promote brands and products on social media without disclosing they are being paid.The concerns expressed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) mirror those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US, which has called for clear disclosure of any sponsorship by social media’s stars.In the UK, the CMA has also rebuked the Manchester-based digital marketing agency Social Chain for misleading the public with unlabelled advertising through online platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.Forty-three individuals and 15 businesses, who either featured in the Social Chain campaigns or posted content in relation to them, received warning letters from the CMA. So far, the identities of the companies and celebrities have not been disclosed.According to the CMA’s findings, the “influencers” endorsed films, games and apps without notifying the readers and viewers of the paid-for content in 19 marketing campaigns organised by Social Chain between March and July 2015.It is the second time this year that the CMA has taken action in relation to what it calls “unlabelled advertising”.“We hope that this work will drive compliance, but should we find evidence of similar conduct in the future, then we will consider whether to take further enforcement action,” Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the Financial Times.Social Chain said it was working with the authorities to ensure it complied with what it described as the “ever-changing advertising regulations”. Since the investigation, the company had appointed a compliance officer to monitor its marketing campaigns, it said.The case has highlighted the challenge for UK and US regulators as they attempt to police the rapidly growing industry of social media marketing involving celebrities and popular bloggers.Brands and advertising agencies are increasingly turning to well-known digital influencers as ad blocking reduces the impact and reach of digital advertising and TV and print audiences decline.For sports stars, actors and musicians, it is a lucrative business. For example, Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has 215m followers on social media across platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and can use the numbers to enhance the value of his sponsorship deals with brands like Nike.According to Forbes, Ronaldo’s online profile helped him earn $88m last year, making him the world’s highest paid athlete.Hookit, a data analytics business that measures sponsorship value in social and digital media, says Ronaldo’s sponsors are getting value for money. It estimates Ronaldo generated $176m in value for his sponsors through promotional work on his social media accounts, with Nike benefiting to the tune of $36m last year.At the same time, social media has created its own generation of international celebrities, such as video bloggers Jérôme Jarre and Casey Neistat.Mr Jarre, who describes himself as a comedian and entrepreneur, has built an audience of 8.6m followers on video app Vine by making short video blogs. His profile has made him a target for advertising agencies and brands desperate to reach younger audiences.According to Captiv8, a US company that links brands to influencers, someone like Mr Jarre, with more than 7m followers, could earn $300,000 for a post on YouTube. Even influencers with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers on Facebook can earn $1,250 per post and $1,000 on Snapchat.“Celebrities and brands are perfectly entitled to promote products via Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or other forms of social media and to be paid to do this,” says Ms Arora.“However, when they do, it’s important that the reader is clear whether they are reading an advertisement which has been paid for, or whether they are reading an unbiased, independent opinion.”While most influencers are following guidelines set by the CMA and FTC, there are still high-profile examples of stars flouting the rules.Last week, the American non-profit group Truth in Advertising highlighted concerns over the online activity of members of the Kardashian and Jenner family, who have risen to prominence through reality TV and social media. The lobby group claimed more than 100 posts from stars such as Kim Kardashian West and Kyle Jenner did “not clearly or conspicuously disclose their relationships with the companies being promoted in the posts”.This followed another high-profile case in the US in 2015, where the FTC called out Lord & Taylor, the clothing retailer, for paying influencers to post promotional photos on Instagram without disclosing it.“No one can afford for social influencers to be falsely influenced by the marketing dollar,” says Simon Pont, chief strategy officer for the London-based digital video and advertising agency Brave Bison. “But it can be murky and the regulators are playing catch-up on this.”The growing importance of social media endorsement to young people is underlined by a survey by the digital research company GlobalWebIndex (GWI). For the second quarter of 2016, 20 per cent of 16-24-year-olds around the world said they had discovered new brands or products through endorsement by a well-known individual or celebrity. The figure was just 7 per cent in the 45-54 age group.Matt Donegan, the managing director of Social Circle, an advertising agency specialising in social media marketing, says many of the companies and individuals not following guidance in their endorsements have done so out of naivety.“It’s a growing industry but it’s also a very young one,” he says. “Most of the mistakes have come through ignorance.”Additional reporting by Anna Nicolaou in New York
117;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-08-30T09:04:24Z;RBC highlights UK retail threats after Brexit vote;;Following the closure of BHS over the weekend after 90 years on the high street, Canadian bank RBC has highlighted some further challenges the UK retail sector will face in the wake of the Brexit vote, suggesting Sports Direct will be one of the biggest strugglers, while online retailers such as ASOS will hold firm.RBC has downgraded Sports Direct to “underperform”, helping the retailer’s shares to fall as much as 4.7 per cent this morning. It has also downgraded Debenhams to “sector perform” from “outperform”, with its shares slipping 3.2 per cent.Although retail sales remained decent in July at least, Richard Chamberlain and Claire Huff at RBC point out a series of heightened risks to UK retail following the vote to leave the EU, with price inflation potentially the most damaging, writes Joel Lewin.The post-referendum plunge in sterling, combined with surging cotton prices and the rising UK living wage will drive a 3 per cent rise in retail prices next year, they predict.They suggest this “will prove difficult to pass onto consumers who have become used to price deflation in the sector”, noting:This has been made worse in recent years by the advent of Black Friday and rising online penetration which tends to be a more promotional channel and increases price transparency for consumers.As such we see ongoing risk to consensus like-for-like sales forecasts for 2017 as apparel retailers try to pass on cost inflation to consumers at a time when other less discretionary costs are also inflating (eg fuel prices).Sports Direct is likely to suffer from this particularly acutely because “as a discounter any price rises are likely to be noticeable to its customers, much more so than at the premium end of the market.”Mike Ashley’s company also sources the majority of its own-label products from Asia in dollars, RBC notes, making it particularly vulnerable to the plunge in sterling.It warns that Sports Direct as well as Debenhams are both highly exposed to the fiercely competitive UK clothing retail sector, as well as potentially problematic cost inflation.Regarding its Debenhams downgrade, RBC says:Given its relatively high fixed-cost base, Debenhams is relatively leveraged to the UK consumer outlook. Also, competition remains fierce in the UK clothing sector, particularly from specialty chains, online retailers and discounters. Debenhams could also see further gross margin pressure from higher-than-expected promotional activity or from input cost pressure if sterling weakens further or labour costs rise further.On a brighter note, the bank’s analysts say online fashion retailers are likely to continue to flourish, while ASOS is set for particularly good times ahead because it is well placed to weather inflationary pressures on the UK retail sector. They add:We think the outlook for ASOS is improving led by volume benefits due to price investments and further delivery enhancements such as faster delivery speeds and later cut-off times. We also think ASOS will continue developing its click and collect offer in Europe as well as expanding its loyalty scheme within the UK. In addition, we see a sizeable revenue growth opportunity for ASOS in the US given recent price cuts and delivery improvements, and with potential plans for future local warehousing.Charts courtesy of RBC
118;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-08-05T12:08:05Z;New Adidas boss faces challenge to improve margins;Turnround has been striking but incoming CEO Kasper Rorsted will inherit a work in progress;In early 2015, it did not look like Herbert Hainer’s tenure at Adidas would have a happy ending. The German sportswear group was losing ground on its arch-rival Nike in the crucial US market. Its share price had tumbled after two profit warnings. And big investors were pushing for new leadership.Fast forward 18 months and the picture is very different. Adidas has raised its profit forecast four times this year. Growth in its US business has picked up enough for Adidas to reclaim the second spot that it lost to Under Armour in 2014. And its share price is up 97 per cent in the past 12 months.So it was no surprise that Mr Hainer, who said in January that he would step down this year after 15 years as chief executive Adidas, was in a jubilant mood as he presided over his final set of results as chief executive.“These financial results are just fantastic,” he said on Thursday, as he gave details of a 21 per cent jump in sales to €4.4bn and a 99 per cent jump in profits to €291m in the second quarter. “I saved the best for last.”The turnround has certainly been striking. But the company that Mr Hainer will hand over to Kasper Rorsted, the former Henkel boss, in October will still be a work in progress. The biggest weakness is its operating margin — Adidas managed 6.5 per cent last year, a far cry from Nike’s 13.9 per cent — and it is this that investors are hoping will be Mr Rorsted’s focus.“The share price reflects the new strategy and anticipates a margin increase,” says Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, one of Adidas’s top 20 investors. “The margin should be significantly above 11 per cent. It’s hard to compare companies but, theoretically, they should be able to get to 13 or 14 per cent like Nike.”Improving margins was one of Mr Rorsted’s main achievements at Henkel, the consumer goods company he ran from 2008 until earlier this year — and John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst, expects the 54-year-old Dane to apply similar techniques at Adidas.“At Henkel, Rorsted was very good at optimising productivity per employee and per store. Nike brought in revenues of over €6m per directly owned store, whereas for Adidas the figure was under €2m last year. There is definitely scope for improvement there,” he says.One area where Mr Rorsted may find it harder to cut back is marketing. Adidas has been investing heavily in its efforts to close the gap on Nike, and has recently struck long-term, and expensive, sponsorship deals with the likes of the German national football team and English Premier League club Manchester United.“Marketing costs look pretty inflationary at the moment,” says one big investor. “I don’t think this will be the place where they take costs out.”Analysts and investors say Mr Rorsted could also offload some of Adidas’s underperforming businesses in an effort to drive up margins. “It’s clear that under Hainer, the management focus was very broad,” says Mr Speich. “Under Rorsted, I am sure there will be a refocusing on the core portfolio and on key markets.”Adidas has already put the bulk of its golf business on the block, and Mr Hainer said on Thursday that the group was talking to interested parties, but gave no indication of how likely a sale was. Some investors also favour offloading Reebok, the US fitness group bought by Mr Hainer in 2005 but whose profitability still lags behind Adidas’s core brands.Others are not so sure. “It wouldn’t be easy to sell Reebok, given how much effort they have spent on integrating it,” says the big investor. “I’m a bit indifferent on this.”The other key focus for Mr Rorsted will be Adidas’s North America business, where the group’s second-quarter revenues of €788m are less than a quarter of Nike’s. Adidas has recently started making up ground, and also posted a sharp improvement in its profitability in the region in the three months to June. But the challenge for Mr Rorsted will be to show that this is sustainable.“The numbers in the second quarter were good but there is still further to go,” says Mr Speich.“The US is where the battle to improve their margins will be won and lost. If they don’t get things right there, it’s hard to see how they can close the gap on Nike.”
119;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-08-04T13:41:23Z;Nike: can’t stand the heat;Nike and Adidas wisely abandon golf clubs;"Serious golfers know that good rounds are not mistake-free. A foolish recovery attempt can quickly turn a bogey into two or three more lost strokes. Better to focus on making the next birdie. Nike is following this playbook. On Wednesday the company said it would ditch its golf equipment business (though it will continue to sell golf attire), knowing it has opportunities to score elsewhere.The exit is not before time. Two decades ago the company signed Tiger Woods to a clothing contract. Then, predicting a golf explosion, it made a leap into the technically challenging world of irons, drivers and balls (its well-known R&D facility in Texas is known as The Oven).Today, participation rates in the sport are stalling. Out of $32bn in revenue in the financial year that ended in June, Nike attributed only about $700m to golf clothing and equipment — a tenth lower than two years ago. Despite its efforts, Nike clubs were not listed as a competitor of the Titleist brand in the prospectus of Acushnet, Titleist’s parent, which is preparing to go public — the honours went to Callaway, Ping and Adidas.Adidas is competing elsewhere, too: it will also hang up its clubs. In May the company said that it would look for buyers for its golf club brand TaylorMade (like Nike, Adidas wants to keep selling golf shoes and clothing). Enhancing its prospects, Adidas declared on Thursday a 7 per cent revenue increase in the unit in its quarterly earnings, which handily beat forecasts.Still, Nike should not be distracted. The company has said it will hit $50bn in annual sales by 2020 (current revenue is $32bn). Yet fourth-quarter revenue growth in its biggest division, North America, was flat; future orders were surprisingly weak. Shares of Nike are down more than a tenth this year (though over the past two years they are up more than 40 per cent).While Nike’s foundation is still in basketball, running and general fitness gear it has not been afraid to make new, targeted bets. And it also has not been afraid to cut losses. Over the years, it has dumped brands that did not work out such as Cole Haan, Umbro and Bauer. With competitors including Under Armour on its heels, it is savvy for Nike to avoid wasting resources in a fringe division. A round of golf should never be marred by a bad hole or two.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

US data showing falling crude inventories helped oil prices rise, with some analysts also pointing to a potential strike in Norway — the largest crude oil producer in western Europe — as contributing to the rally.Murphy Oil, an oil and gas exploration and production company, helped lead the sector’s rebound, rising 6.4 per cent to $32.01.Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refinery in the US, rose 4.4 per cent to $37.26. Noble Energy gained 3.5 per cent to $36.31.It was a different story for Texas-based Southwestern Energy. Its stock price fell 6.2 per cent on Wednesday to $13.03, the worst performance across the S&P 500 index, after the company offered 75m common shares to the public.The company intends to use proceeds from the stock offering to repay $375m of debt. Its share price rose by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after extending maturities and tweaking conditions on more than $2bn of outstanding credit.The financials sector also had a strong rally, rising 2.3 per cent. The sector had been hard hit after the UK’s vote to leave the EU and was braced for the release by the Federal Reserve of bank’s stress test results on Wednesday evening.Utilities also made gains after initially lagged behind the broader stock market rally, rising 0.3 per cent. The sector typically performs well when investors are defensive, making its underperformance indicative of some renewed risk appetite.Elsewhere, Nike, the sports clothing and equipment brand, saw its stock price bounce 3.8 per cent to $55.13, having fallen by more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following a mixed earnings report.Nike reported profits of 49 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 48 cents a share. But the focus turned to underwhelming revenues growth, which rose 6 per cent to $8.24bn, below the market’s target of $8.28bn.“We remain bullish on both secular and structural tailwinds for Nike’s business,” said analysts at Stifel. “Stiffer [currency] headwinds and a more volatile macro picture, however, leave us slightly more cautious on near-term fundamentals.”Rival sporting goods producer Under Armour rose 5.9 per cent to $39.75, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 index.Alcoa, the metals producer, outlined plans for its split into two companies, hiving off mining, refining and smelting from the more profitable materials production business that serves transportation and construction industries.The announcement sent the company’s stock down 2.5 per cent to $9.10. The spun off company will retain the Alcoa name, while the remaining assets will begin trading under a new name of Arconic.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 2,070.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6 per cent to 17,694.7 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.9 per cent to 4,779.3.

It reported strong revenue growth internationally when comparing the most recent quarterly performance with the corresponding period last year. But North American revenue growth fell flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis.The company cited congested ports on the west coast of the US, which delayed the delivery of merchandise into the final three months of fiscal year 2015. Nike also had to sell existing inventory at a discount, depressing margins.Inventories are back to normal. Ports have caught up with the backlog, and shipments are arriving. North America should pick up speed again.Under Armour and a resurgent Adidas are challenging Nike in the US. But with robust sales growth elsewhere, and inventory issues resolved, the sell-off looks overdone. It remains a strong contender.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
122;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-06-28T20:28:07Z;Nike sinks as key metric misses Wall St views;;The shares of Nike fell 6 per cent late on Tuesday after the apparel maker said a key indicator of future sales missed Wall Street estimates in its last quarter.The Oregon-based group said worldwide futures orders, or orders that retailers make for delivery over the next few months, rose by 11 per cent on a year-on-year basis, excluding currency impacts, in the quarter to the end of May. That fell short of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg of an increase of 13 per cent.The figure is closely-watched since it is considered to be a good predictor of future revenues.The Dow component’s shares have fallen by 15.6 per cent this year on worries about rising competition from the likes of Under Armour and Adidas, as well as headwinds from the bankruptcy and liquidation of Sports Authority, the US sportswear retailer.Meanwhile, Nike’s sales in the fiscal fourth quarter climbed 6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $8.24bn, shy of estimates of $8.28bn. Net income fell to $846m from $865m. Earnings per share of 49 cents topped expectations by one cent.Nike’s shares dropped 6.3 per cent in after hours trading on Tuesday.
123;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-06-26T11:59:34Z;Week Ahead Corporate Diary: June 27 — July 1;Monsanto investors hoping for update on the next step in Bayer’s attempted takeover bid;"Diary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Nike, the athletic apparel maker, is expected to have stretched to solid increases in sales and earnings in the past year when it releases fourth-quarter results.Bloomberg’s consensus of analysts’ estimates puts the year’s revenues at $32.48bn, compared with last year’s $30.6bn, while pre-tax profits are estimated at $4.63bn, up from $4.21bn in 2014-15. EPS for the year is forecast to be $2.16, compared with $1.85.The improvement comes after Nike in March disclosed a cautious outlook and weaker quarterly sales growth than Wall Street forecast.Oregon-based Nike — which boasts more than 90 per cent of the basketball shoe market, though rival Under Armour has made recent inroads — reported revenues up 8 per cent to $8bn on a year-on-year basis in its third quarter, missing expectations of $8.2bn, when it said strong consumer demand drove revenue growth across the brand portfolio.Mark Parker, chief executive, said: “Nike delivered robust and balanced growth across our expansive, powerful portfolio.”But the company said in March its sales took a hit due to a strong dollar, which makes the price of US goods more expensive abroad and reduces the amount that groups earn when foreign sales are converted back into dollars. On a currency-neutral basis, sales advanced 14 per cent.Nike also expects its revenues to rise at a “high single-digit rate” in the fiscal year to May 2017, while analysts were looking for fiscal 2017 sales growth of about 10 per cent. Nike expects EPS to rise in low single-digits, against a consensus estimate of 15 per cent.Nike’s shares, which surged by almost a third in 2015, have added about 2 per cent in the past year to $54.36.Global demand for athletic goods remains high, but Nike continues to face margin pressure, mainly in the US. Simon GreavesEarningsNike Q4 $0.48 ($0.49)Ocado FY 2.63p (1.91p)Electricals retailer Dixons Carphone is expected to report a slight dip in revenues but a healthy boost to profits when it delivers its full-year results.Last month the high street retailer, which sells a range of electrical and telecommunications products, said it expected full-year profits to be near the upper end of its guidance after a decent quarter in which like-for-like sales grew 5 per cent.Revenues are expected to dip 3 per cent to £9.6bn, following the closure of 134 UK stores, but pre-tax profits are expected to jump 17 per cent to £447m.Dixons has been boosted by a rise in sales of 4K ultra high-definition televisions and cordless vacuum cleaners, and Seb James, chief executive, rubbished the excuses of rival retailers when unveiling the group’s quarterly results in May.“There has been much commentary about the state of mind of UK consumers. Our view is that consumers are ready to spend but have rightly become more canny, and so need to be tempted with great deals and exciting new products,” he said.Dixons Carphone is also rolling out a new store format, combining its three major brands, Carphone Warehouse, Currys, and PC World, in one store. It currently has well over 250 stores in the new format, and is looking to add more.The company was created from the merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in 2014, and continues to defy critics — when the merger was unveiled there were predictions of boardroom bust-ups and big store closures. Its share of the mobile phone market has grown while other retailers, such has Phones4U, have fallen. Paul McCleanFor the maker of Cheerio’s the fiscal fourth quarter was not a particularly happy one.General Mills is being squeezed in several key product areas: yoghurt, cereals and meals. Like the rest of the food industry in the US, the company has been cutting costs and diversifying into healthier fare through acquisitions of smaller brands as consumers increasingly opt for more wholesome foods.But the landscape is competitive, particularly when it comes to yoghurt, and the competition has not always been pretty. In an increasingly crowded market, General Mills, which makes Yoplait, earlier this year won an injunction against Chobani, halting the broadcast of a commercial it said made false claims that Yoplait Greek 100 was laced with a pesticide that is “used to kill bugs”.Cereals, which have been on a downward slide for years, are not expected to return to strong growth any time soon, while prepared meals are mainly selling in the fresh segment.As such, in the company’s final quarter of its fiscal year, due to its divestiture of its Green Giant frozen vegetables brand, the group probably posted a 10 per cent decline in revenues to $3.86bn, and a 23 per cent decline in adjusted net income to $355.2bn, or 59.6 cents a share, according to consensus analyst estimates from Bloomberg. On an unadjusted basis, EPS probably nearly doubled to 59 cents.Analysts have said they expect the company to make further acquisitions as the consumer shifts further towards healthier food, including overseas. Some have also highlighted the company as a potential target of KraftHeinz, as speculation rises over which company in the industry could be the next target for the 3G-Warren Buffett team that has transformed the industry with its forceful cost-cutting techniques. Lindsay WhippWhen Monsanto announces third-quarter earnings the company’s results will not necessarily be top of investors’ minds. Instead they will be hoping for an update on what is the next step in Bayer’s attempted bid for the controversial maker of genetically modified seeds.It has been a month since Monsanto rejected the Bayer board’s $122-a-share offer for the St Louis-based agrichemical company.Monsanto said the offer was too low but said it was open to further talks. Bayer, whose investors have been wary of the potential of the combination, has yet to raise its offer, saying it believes the existing one is fair.This leaves the potential combination of the two in limbo. Monsanto has said before that even in a landscape of fast consolidation it can thrive as a standalone company. But it is not without its problems.It has already cut its forecast for full-year earnings against a backdrop of a strong dollar hitting exports and is cutting its workforce in a sluggish agricultural economy where farmers’ incomes have been hit by low prices.In the quarter ended May 31, Monsanto’s revenue is estimated to have fallen 1.8 per cent to $4.5bn, with adjusted net income dropping 6.2 per cent to $1.07bn, or $2.43 a share, according to consensus analyst estimates from Bloomberg. On an unadjusted basis it probably posted EPS of $2.34, a 1.6 per cent increase.

124;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-06-24T05:05:24Z;Latest spin on tennis equipment is set to change the game;Endorsements and innovation are king in a competitive market;The tennis equipment industry is confronting what it regards as two unhappy birthdays. Roger Federer is 35 in August and Rafael Nadal was 30 this month, which means both are approaching the end of their careers.Player endorsement is a crucial factor in selling tennis gear and these charismatic stars have proved highly effective in that regard.“Federer and Nadal are the two that can really sell products,” says Rohun Davda, manager of Wigmore Sports, a London specialist tennis retailer.Federer receives a reported $2m a year from Wilson, the US manufacturer, to use its rackets. Both he and Nadal have longstanding deals to wear the clothing of Nike, which is the world’s market leader in tennis clothes, followed by Adidas.Jolyn de Boer, executive director of the US Tennis Industry Association, says the pair also inspire people to play the game. “And the more people play, the more they will buy equipment,” she says.Nadal has also played a significant part in the rapid rise of Babolat, the French company, having used its rackets throughout his career. “During the last 15 or so years Babolat have gone from nothing to number one brand in the world,” Mr Davda says.The Lyon-based company, founded in 1875, began as a racket string manufacturer. It made its first rackets in 1994. At that time the global industry had been dominated for years by Wilson and Prince, also of the US, and Head, the Dutch-Austrian manufacturer.Babolat began a strong marketing campaign that signed leading juniors around the world to use its rackets, it kitted out club coaches and crucially hit the jackpot in the top players it sponsored. Carlos Moya won the French Open in 1998 using a Babolat racket and was followed by grand-slam title winners Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters and Nadal.Head estimates that global racket sales were 7.9m in 2015, with a wholesale value of €290m. Racket manufacturers do not release their sales figures, but the industry consensus is that Babolat and Wilson top the world list, with Head third and Japan’s Yonex fourth.The leading brands have innovated to remain at the top. In 2013, Head became the first to produce a racket made of graphene, the substance that is 200 times stronger than steel yet ultra light and flexible.More recently Babolat introduced a racket with an integrated sensor that records a player’s strokes digitally and Wilson has aimed to provide greater spin on shots with a new stringing system.While Nike and Adidas lead the tennis clothing market over old rivals such as Fila, Lacoste and Lotto, bold entries have been made by Under Armour of the US and Uniqlo of Japan. The Japanese company signed current world number one Novak Djokovic in 2012 and Under Armour began a four-year, £15m deal with Andy Murray last year.The clothing sector has gained a significant boost this century from the replacement of cotton by polymer materials, such as polyester, that absorb sweat and move it to the fabric’s surface where it evaporates, allowing players to feel cooler and more comfortable.It is shoes, however, that are the most important equipment item for tennis players after the racket. Comfort, cushioning, support and grip for feet facing the varying challenges of hard, clay and grass courts are crucial.Footwear is also the biggest earner of all tennis equipment. The US Tennis Industry Association says total spending in 2014 on shoes by tennis players in the US, the world’s biggest tennis market, was $227.8m compared with $188.4m on clothing and $174.6m on rackets.Djokovic in particular has highlighted the importance of shoes. After ending his clothing deal with Adidas in 2009, he switched first to Italian brand Sergio Tacchini before uniting with Uniqlo, yet throughout these two changes has refused to wear anything other than his favoured Adidas footwear.The world’s best player has found the make that suits him best, and he is sticking to it.Wimbledon may epitomise tennis tradition with its grass courts, all-white dress code and blazered officials, but the wider game is in the grip of a digital revolution.Changes in racket technology have predominantly been about materials, progressing over the past 40 years from wood to aluminium, steel and then graphite and graphene. The most recent development, however, has been digital sensors that attach to rackets and record a player’s shot selection, power, spin and ball contact accuracy.Leading technology company Sony, and smaller ones such as Zepp Labs in California and 9 Degrees Freedom of Singapore with its Qlipp brand, have all produced such gadgets. These stream the data to players’ smartphones or computers, helping them to analyse their game.The sensors are attached to the base of the strings or slot on the end of the handle, or as in Babolat’s case, are integrated in the handle.Tennis courts have also been digitised. American company PlaySight has built more than 400 “smart” courts around the world and this year is set to install more at the US Tennis Association’s new campus near Orlando, Florida.Such courts have high-definition cameras and sensors around them, providing real-time and post-match video data similar to that provided by racket sensors and automated line calling.All this content is uploaded to the “cloud” to be pored over by the players and their coaches.Jolyn de Boer, US Tennis Industry Association executive director, says such technology “is a game-changer for tennis” in helping players to improve and creating an “online community”.People will be able to put their playing data online and find opponents of similar level, she says, thereby creating near-perfect matches.
125;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-06-09T12:30:13Z;Maria Sharapova’s sponsors rally round despite tennis star’s ban;Nike, Evian and Head renew commercial deals;Tennis champion Maria Sharapova has regained the support of a number of corporate sponsors, despite being banned from the sport for two years after testing positive for the use of a banned substance.On Wednesday, the International Tennis Federation, the sport’s world governing body, instituted a ban following the player’s positive test for meldonium at the Australian Open in January. Ms Sharapova immediately said she would appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, describing the punishment as “unfairly harsh”.But some of the player’s sponsors have leapt on the ITF’s ruling that her contravention of doping rules was unintentional, as justification for renewing their relationship with the 29-year-old Russian.Nike, which had previously said it would drop its sponsorship of the former Wimbledon champion said it would “continue to partner with her.”Evian, the mineral water brand owned by French group Danone, also said it would “maintain its long-lasting relationship with the champion”.Head, Ms Sharapova’s racket sponsor — which had strongly defended the player after her initial admission of use of meldonium — said it would seek to extend her contract.Carmaker Porsche said it would wait for the outcome of Ms Sharapova’s appeal against the ban before making a final decision on its deal with the player. It had previously suspended activities with Ms Sharapova, including the release of a TV advertising campaign in which she was featured, but said it was maintaining contact with the tennis player and her representatives.Watchmaker TAG Heuer had a contract with Ms Sharapova that ended in 2015, but it stopped negotiations on renewing the partnership following news of the failed drugs test.On Thursday, Jean-Claude Biver, chief executive of Tag Heuer, said: “We now have some time and, as she has [been] suspended for two years, we are not in a hurry any more to sign a new contract today or this month. We will see later what we are going to do.”Ms Sharapova had been the world’s best-paid female athlete for 11 years. But, earlier this week, Forbes reported that her tennis rival Serena Williams had replaced her at the top of the list after earning $28.9m over the past year. Ms Sharapova earned $21.9m with about $20m coming from endorsements.On Wednesday, another sponsor, Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics company, said its relationship with Ms Sharapova “was a limited engagement that focused on one of our fragrances. The engagement is set to expire and we had not planned to extend this relationship regardless of the current situation.”Ms Sharapova said she had been taking meldonium under its alternative name, Mildronate, for the past 10 years for health reasons and had not known the substance was banned. Meldonium was added to the list of substances banned by the ITF on January 1, following a decision last September.In its verdict, the ITF said Ms Sharapova had not intentionally broken the rules as she had not known Mildronate contained a banned substance from January of this year.But the federation said she was “the sole author of her own misfortune”, as she had “failed to take any steps to check whether continued use of the medicine was permissible”.
126;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-06-01T19:20:31Z;Lululemon founder Wilson seeks board election changes;;Is Chip Wilson taking a leaf out of William J Pulte’s book?Mr Wilson, who founded yoga wear maker Lululemon, has issued an open letter to the company’s shareholders noting his dissatisfaction with the board and calling for its declassification in an effort to make directors more accountable for the company’s performance.The letter, published after Mr Wilson was denied the opportunity to speak at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for Thursday, noted that the current staggered board only allows shareholders the right to vote on three directors at a time, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.Mr Wilson — who announced his resignation in 2013 amid controversy over remarks he made about overweight customers after complaints that some Lululemon yoga pants were see-through — said in his letter that Lululemon’s shares have underperformed rivals like Nike and Under Armour since Laurent Potdevin was hired as chief executive.Lululemon shares have dropped about 6 per cent since Mr Potdevin took the reins, while shares of Under Armour and Nike have risen 76 per cent and 39 per cent respectively over the same period.He said:Unfortunately, lululemon has lost its way and I believe a call to action is needed. I feel strongly that our current Board and management team must clearly articulate and execute a strategy with urgency towards regaining lululemon’s competitive advantage and profitable growth and they must take responsibility.Lululemon created the global athleisure market (which I refer to as “streetnic” — stretch, technical, street — market) and seeded a revolution in the way we all dress. But we are just at the beginning. We cannot continue to cede the market opportunity we created to Under Armour and Nike. The Company’s greatest opportunities are ahead.The founder who maintains that he is the largest shareholder, with a 14.2 per cent stake, said management’s “competence is uninspiring at best”.But Mr Wilson’s criticisms follow upbeat fourth quarter results from Lululemon, which also noted at the time that its inventories “may even begin to look lean”. That has fueled investor optimism with Lululemon shares rising 26 per cent so far this year. The company’s shares were up 2 per cent on Wednesday.Mr Wilson’s open letter follows similar moves by Mr Pulte, founder of homebuilder PulteGroup earlier this year. Mr Pulte had waged a public and vitriolic battle seeking the immediate departure of chief executive Richard Dugas earlier this year.
127;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-05-26T10:53:01Z;Debenhams hires Amazon’s Sergio Bucher as chief executive;Retailer banks on fashion specialist’s online experience to counter sluggish sales and fierce competition;Debenhams has raided the ranks of online retailer Amazon for its new chief executive — in a sign of how the department store group hopes to reposition itself amid fierce competition and weak sales growth.Sergio Bucher, vice-president of Amazon’s European fashion division, will take up the role in October, Debenhams announced on Thursday.Having also worked at Puma, Nike and Inditex — the Spanish group behind the Zara clothing chain — Mr Bucher brings wide-ranging retail experience, particularly in branding and online.Sir Ian Cheshire, Debenhams chairman, said the company had conducted a rigorous recruitment process and was drawn to Mr Bucher’s “wealth of ecommerce expertise”.“I am confident we have the best possible person to realise the potential of ‘new Debenhams’ as a leading international multichannel retailer with a bright future,” Sir Ian said.Debenhams, which has suffered a 37 per cent fall in its share price since the end of November 2012 following a series of profit warnings, has said it wants to double the proportion of revenues its derives from online, from 15 to 30 per cent, and reposition itself as a quality and designer-driven retailer.Sir Ian told reporters on Thursday that Mr Bucher’s priority would be to increase Debenhams’ appeal to its average core customer: a 41-year-old woman, who Sir Ian described as “much younger” and “more fashion-interested” than a typical customer at rival Marks and Spencer.“She shops once a week and uses the internet to get ideas,” he said. “She’s interested in the experience of shopping and looking for newness and the breadth of choice of brand. We can do a lot more for that customer, maybe, than we are doing at the moment — and that’s where Sergio is going to be focusing his time.”Mr Bucher will replace Michael Sharp, who had signalled his decision to leave Debenhams last year and submitted his resignation last month after the company came under pressure from activist investors.During his tenure, Mr Sharp had focused on improving Debenhams’ online business, introducing next-day delivery to homes and stores, and cutting delivery charges.Analysts were optimistic that Mr Bucher could make further enhancements to the retailer’s online offering.Assad Malik of Citibank said: “Whilst his name may be unfamiliar to some in the sector, we believe the market may favour his mix of ecommerce expertise, previous brands and international experience — particularly given these are becoming focus areas for Debenhams.”Amazon makes limited disclosures about its European fashion business, but Euromonitor estimated that the US e-commerce giant’s apparel and footwear sales in western Europe were around €3bn in 2015.In recent years, Amazon made multiple investments in its European fashion operation, including the creation of a 46,000 sq ft London photo studio to shoot product images, and the hiring of actress Suki Waterhouse and others to represent the brand in Europe.For Debenhams, Mr Bucher’s appointment is the latest in a series of board changes. Last year, the store group hired Matt Smith from Mothercare as chief financial officer.It also comes as group profitability shows a slight improvement. Having fallen from £139m in 2013 to £105.8m in 2014, Debenhams’ pre-tax profit picked up slightly to £113m in the year to July 2015.In its most recent results, covering the six months to February 27, pre-tax profit rose to £93.8, up from £88.9m in the same period last year. However, group like-for-like sales growth slowed, rising 1.1 per cent on a reported basis, compared with 1.3 per cent in the same period a year earlier.Debenhams has had a reputation among consumers for discounting. But it says it has increased the contribution made by full price sales, scaled back its price reductions, and reduced stock held in stores to improve cash management.However, conditions for clothing retailers in the UK remain difficult.Marks and Spencer, which is also trying to revive clothing sales, warned on Wednesday that market conditions would be likely to remain “challenging” for the rest of this year.This year, rival Next also said that British households were choosing to spend more on leisure and recreational activities — and less on new clothing.

Following a rigorous recruitment process with some exceptional quality candidates, Sergio’s wealth of e-commerce expertise, international experience and clear leadership qualities stood out. I am confident we have the best possible person to realise the potential of ‘new Debenhams’ as a leading international multi-channel retailer with a bright future.Mr Bucher replaces Michael Sharp, who announced his decision to leave Debenhams last year after the company came under pressure from activist investors.The new chief executive’s task of revamping Debenhams will be made all the more difficult as conditions for clothing retailers in the UK deteriorate.Rival Next warned earlier this year that British households were choosing to spend more on leisure and recreational activities and were cutting down their spending on clothing. Marks and Spencer, which is also trying to undergo a revival of its own, also warned yesterday that market conditions would likely remain “challenging” for the rest of this year.Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics appeared to support those views as clothing and footwear was the only category to suffer a sales decline when retail sales data for April were published.

The latest kind to chase their signature are middle-aged lawyers, working for makers of sports kit. This week, Chelsea FC closed in on a £600m kit deal with Nike after ending its previous contract with Adidas. Basketball legend LeBron James has reportedly agreed to his own shoe deal with Nike that is thought be worth $1bn over its life. And upstart Under Armour has hitched its wagon to Stephen Curry, the sharpshooting US hoopster. Team owners have been burnt by overspending for talent in the pursuit of championships. It may be the outfitters’ turn to overextend themselves.The shoe and jersey rivalries resemble another commercial tug of war in sports. Networks, notably Disney’s ESPN, have paid top dollar for television rights for various sports leagues. Live broadcasts are prized by advertisers. Yet ESPN results have suffered in recent quarters as the steep cost of those rights ate into margins and subscribers headed for the exits anyway. The sports gear market may prove healthier, however. Athletic apparel is a rare growth area in retail. There is not yet an analogue to cord-cutting for trainers.Adidas has been struggling for years. But for Nike and Under Armour the scoreboard looks better. In the past three years, shares of the pair are up 170 per cent and 360 per cent respectively. Under Armour was only founded in 1996 and his risen quickly in the US standings. Nike has been able to stay on top because of its wider product assortment, strength globally and strong execution. Its operating margin, at over 15 per cent, is several points higher than Under Armour’s.Yet scrappy underdog Under Armour is pushing Nike hard. Concerns about Nike’s growth potential have sent its shares down a tenth this year. The only clear victor at the moment will be, as usual, the athletes showered with ever more dollars and attention.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
130;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-05-18T16:29:16Z;Nike nets Chelsea FC kit deal worth £600m;Ten-year contract worth £60m a year would be the second most lucrative in English football;Nike is closing in on a kit deal with Chelsea Football Club worth £60m a year, making it the second most lucrative in the history of England’s Premier League.The US sportswear group outpaced competition from Under Armour, its fast growing but much smaller rival, after intense negotiations with Chelsea, according to a person directly involved in the talks.Oregon-based Nike declined to comment when contacted by the Financial Times.The £600m deal, which is set to run for at least a decade, underscores the value Premier League clubs present to global brands, especially those with a growing commercial interest in Asia, even if jersey sales do not necessarily offset the size of the big deals. It also marks a change in the way that brands are using their endorsement money in mega deals, favouring teams over individuals, said Matt Powell, sports industry analyst at NPD, the research group.“One of the jokes I make is that a team or a league can’t get arrested,” Mr Powell said. “Frankly, athletes get hurt but teams continue to have a strong following of fans, so they’ve discovered [it is a] much more meaningful branding opportunity.”Nike recently pulled its sponsorship deal with tennis star Maria Sharapova, who tested positive for a banned substance, while a few years ago it ended its deal with NFL running back Ray Rice amid allegations of domestic abuse and cyclist Lance Armstrong following evidence of his use of performance-enhancing drugs.Nike has far more financial clout than upstart Under Armour, which has been successful with signing less well known teams or athletes that have grown to be stars.And Nike’s 11.8 per cent net margin is far higher than Under Armour’s 5.7 per cent, suggesting that the company is much better positioned to absorb an expensive deal.“Nike can afford it if a deal blows up [of this size],” said Paul Swinand, an analyst at Morningstar, adding that the deal Nike is expected to sign amounts to about 20 per cent of Under Armour’s operating margin.Chelsea had a kit deal in place until 2023 with German sportswear company Adidas, but the contract was cancelled in May by mutual agreement.Adidas still produces shirts for German champions Bayern Munich, Italian champions Juventus, Spanish runners-up Real Madrid, and Manchester United, who finished fifth this year and failed to qualify for the Champions League.A new contract with Nike will mark a sharp increase in the value of Chelsea’s kit deals. Its original agreement with Adidas, signed in summer 2013, was worth only £30m a year.Despite its decline in form, Manchester United will retain the top spot in terms of Premier League shirt deals. It moved from Nike to Adidas in 2014, in a contract worth £750m over 10 years. Revenue from the deal was one of the main reasons behind the club’s jump in earnings last year.However, Chelsea’s move to Nike — first reported by the Daily Telegraph — will put it firmly ahead of Arsenal, whose five-year deal with Puma, signed in 2014, is worth slightly more than £30m a year.Chelsea’s lucrative contract follows a disappointing season for the 2015 champions, who finished 10th this year — 31 points behind surprise winners Leicester City — their worst result in 20 years.Commercial revenue — largely sponsorships — have become a key distinguishing factor in football team finances, following the introduction of Financial Fair Play rules across Europe.The proceeds from broadcasting rights, such as the Premier League’s new £5.1bn contract due to start next season, are typically shared evenly between teams, while growing unrest among fans has limited the potential for higher ticket prices.Chelsea’s main shirt sponsorship deal with Japan’s Yokohama tyres is worth £50m a year, while Thai energy drinks maker Carabao paid about £30m to sponsor the club’s training gear for three years.Additional reporting by Aliya RamThis article has been amended since its original publication. It previously said the Carabao deal to sponsor Chelsea’s training kit was worth £30m a year. The figure actually relates to a three-year deal.

132;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
133;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-05-10T11:46:51Z;John Lynch, Lynka — more Warsaw than Wharton;The US business school graduate learnt about real corporate life from his experiences in Poland;"When John Lynch arrived at Krakow airport from New York in 1991, he had nothing to declare but his macaroni.The Wharton MBA graduate, then 29 years old, had quit his job with a Connecticut-based management consultancy for a 12-month posting with the US Agency for International Development advising small business owners in Poland, a country just breaking free from communist rule.Mr Lynch, whose great grandmother was Polish, had a basic grasp of the language, but was ignorant of the country’s history, and had packed half his suitcase with pasta because friends had warned about food shortages. “I wasn’t really sure where Krakow was so had to look it up on the map,” he admits, squirming at the memory. “I then found out it was where Pope John Paul II came from, so I thought, well, this is probably a nice place.”A quarter of a century later, Mr Lynch is still in Krakow, running Lynka, a clothing and corporate gifts business he co-founded a year after arriving with his girlfriend, now ex-wife, Anne Kalin.The couple had been so inspired by the people they were helping to start small shops or factories — “some of them doing remarkably well” — that they decided to do it themselves. Lynka is a merger of both her and Mr Lynch’s last names. Ms Kalin is no longer involved in the business.The company started as a “little pro­ject”, Mr Lynch says, making souvenirs for visiting friends and family, who would marvel at the well-preserved medieval architecture around Krakow’s central square. “Nobody was doing tourism T-shirts. I went out and sold them in the marketplace, at little tourist shops, hotels, and in about the first two weeks we sold 500 T-shirts and made $300,” says Mr Lynch, speaking on a visit to London. Indicating his small overnight case, he jokes that he no long­er needs space for food supplies.Today Lynka focuses on the corporate market, supplying uniforms and workwear, promotional items and business gifts to organisations in 25 countries. It employs more than 300 people at its Krakow base, has annual sales of about €20m and is the only official manufacturer of Nike clothes in central and eastern Europe.We had to drive the orders to customers in little cars, or send employees on trains and buses across the country to deliver door to doorIn the early days Poland suffered from poor infrastructure, skills shortages and corruption, says Mr Lynch. “The rule of thumb back then was anybody with experience in anything was probably someone you didn’t want to hire.“The Polish [postal system] back then took 21 days to deliver a package somewhere in Poland so we had to drive the orders to customers in little cars, or send employees on trains and buses across the country to deliver door to door.”That said, Mr Lynch also admits that he had many shortcomings as an entrepreneur and it was Polish contacts and colleagues who helped him develop the skills to build a company. “Certainly, this was not the ‘genius westerner comes over and shows the poor Poles how to do business’,” he says. “I learnt more about doing business, at being an entrepreneur in Poland, from Poles than in all the business schools in the world.”Poland has changed since Mr Lynch launched his venture, back when Lech Wałęsa was still a relatively new president. Today it is the sixth-largest economy in the EU, and whose 5 per cent growth in gross domestic product last year was higher than the OECD average of 2.4 per cent, although income per head lags behind other big western countries.However, Mr Lynch says, there is still a “completely different way of thinking” about business in Poland compared with his home country, the US.“Sales reps in America are fine with a low base salary and a large commission. They just believe in ‘if I work hard I’ll make this sale and get my commission’,” he says. “Polish sales reps are very concerned about security. They want to make sure that if nothing sells this month, or the Russians attack and it all goes to hell, that they are going to have that base salary to pay the rent.”Mr Lynch is more Warsaw than Wharton as he tries to spread ideas about good business practice drawn from his experience. He is a former chairman of the Polish chapter of the Young Presidents Organization, a US-based networking club started more than 60 years ago, which provides coaching by business school professors and peer support to business owners.He talks about his business philosophy, summarised as a focus on integrity, quality and constant improvement: “No revolutions, just small change, day by day.” But he is frank about some challenging aspects of starting and running a smaller, private business.Listen to John Lynch talking to the FT’s Jonathan Moules, in one of 10 episodes of this popular series where founders share tales from the entrepreneurial frontlineHis most difficult moment was in 2013,when Lynka’s largest shareholder sold its stake. An emerging markets investment fund then attempted a hostile takeover of the business through a legal action in the Polish courts.“For several months, I was technically no longer the owner nor CEO of the business,” Mr Lynch says. He was banned from the building, with security guards on the door, and went to court to fight the case. His lawyers won an agreement that he could be handed back a controlling stake if the employees wrote in a letter that they were standing by him and that Lynka would be in dire straits without him.Persuading any of Lynka’s then 170 staff to write such a missive was like something out of a Hollywood thriller, Mr Lynch says. “The lawyers had said if we didn’t get at least 30 or 40 signatures it wouldn’t carry much weight.” In the end 158 employees signed.When the letter was handed to him in a bar near Lynka’s offices, Mr Lynch cried. There was the relief he would win his case, but also that he had the support of so many employees, some of whom had worked for Lynka for 20 years. They could have lost their jobs as a result of a public declaration of loyalty.He later found out that the signatories had gathered in the toilets and in hidden corners of the warehouse to sign the letter. “It was just the ultimate testimony to why it pays to have a good culture and a good atmosphere at work and show people that you’re fair yourself.”The crisis taught him several lessons, such as use of humour as both a weapon and a stress reliever, and making sure you distance yourself from bad news. “I forwarded emails to my adviser to read first,” he says. “Don’t run through worst-case scenarios. It will kill you.”Mr Lynch emphasises that hostile takeovers happen in countries considered much more entrepreneur-friendly than Poland. “To outsiders the entrepreneurial life looks glamorous, a route to sure-fire millions, but in fact it is hard, hard work with more risks and chances for failure than one can imagine,” he says.“In most cases, the success comes, if at all, after many, many years and even decades . . . You are always under threat, under pressure.”Biggest setback: “My biggest failure came in certain negotiations when I so desperately wanted the deal to go through that I got worse conditions than I probably could have. I have since learned that to win in any high-stakes negotiation, one needs to be ready to walk away, and let the deal die.”

Best advice: “Someone once told me that perseverance and grit are the most important traits needed for an entrepreneur to succeed. My personal slogan is ‘keep the faith’. To me, it means to continue in the committed pursuit of some idea or goal that is worthy but difficult to achieve.”

Executive technology: “I love my iPhone 6S — I use the notes app to write down ideas and thoughts. My mind gets really full of them, so I review what I have written down at the end of the week.”"
134;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-04-27T14:43:16Z;Has Apple succumbed to the ‘Curse of the Dow’?;;Traders can be a superstitious crowd, and one of the best known ill omens of financial markets is the so-called “Curse of the Dow”, based on the frequency of companies peaking just as they gain entry into the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average.Obviously talk of a curse is anecdotal but amusing nonsense, but even the mighty Apple appears to have succumbed to the jinx, writes Robin Wigglesworth in New York.The tech giant gained entry in the blue-chip average on March 18, replacing AT&T. Apple’s shares peaked at $134.54 on April 28, and after yesterday’s earnings miss have now lost almost a quarter of their value since the March 18 DJIA inclusion. Meanwhile, AT&T’s stock has gained over 13 per cent since then.Even at the time of the inclusion, some analysts speculated that the “Curse of the Dow” might strike again. Here’s Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, writing in mid-2015 when Apple had already begun to slip somewhat:Now, you can’t blame the Dow stock selection committee too much. Their job is to pick very large and high quality American companies that reflect the broad economy. Apple fits that description nicely, and it does have the current financial performance to prove it. Analysts that cover the company on Wall Street expect it to produce +20% revenue growth in each of the next two quarters. But as the old saying goes, the difference between a good stock and a good company is valuation. And thus far, it seems all that good news was already baked into Apple’s slice of the Dow pie.But the Dow Curse has a muddled track record. Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Visa all joined the Dow on September 20, 2013, and since then they have suffered disparate fortunes. The investment bank’s shares have only gained a miserly 2 per cent since then, but Visa is up over 57 per cent, and Nike has rocketed 71 per cent.
135;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Adidas raises profit and revenue forecasts again;Sales rise boosts second-biggest sportswear group in race against Nike;Adidas raised its profit and revenue forecasts for 2016 after posting better than expected results for the first quarter.In an unscheduled announcement, the world’s second-biggest sportswear group said sales in the three months to March climbed 22 per cent to €4.8bn. Net income jumped 38 per cent to €350m, or €1.75 per share. Analysts had forecast €1.33 per share.Shares in the company, which have risen more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months as the group recovered from a difficult year in 2014, leapt a further 6.9 per cent on the news. The shares were trading at €115 by early afternoon in Frankfurt.Adidas’s fortunes were boosted by currency fluctuations — stripping these out, sales rose 17 per cent — but the strong quarter gave the group sufficient confidence to raise its profit and revenue forecasts for the second time in three months.The German group, which competes with US rival Nike for domination of the global sportswear market, expects sales to rise roughly 15 per cent this year, up from a previous forecast of 10 to 12 per cent.It also forecasts that net income will rise by between 15 and 18 per cent, instead of between 10 and 12 per cent.Adidas did not give reasons for its improved performance, but will provide full details of its first-quarter results on May 4. Nonetheless, the fact that it is expecting profits to rise faster than sales is positive for the group as it has been under pressure from big investors to improve its margins, which lag far behind those of Nike.In the year to the end of February, Nike’s operating margin reached 14.4 per cent. The equivalent figure at Adidas for the year to the end of December was just 6.5 per cent. One of the key reasons the German group has chosen Kasper Rorsted to succeed Herbert Hainer as chief executive later this year is his record of improving margins at the German consumer group Henkel.One of the main drags on Adidas’s performance over the past year has been its portfolio of golf businesses, which has been hit hard by the declining popularity of the sport in the US. Adidas announced a review of the division last year and analysts expect it will decide to sell it off.John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst, said the golf division would fetch less than €500m and added this could be reinvested in Adidas’s other businesses or returned to shareholders via a special dividend or a share buyback.

State corporate tax 6.6% up to $1m; 7.6% above that
Unicorns 0The city of Portland in the US Pacific Northwest is known for its alternative, do-it-yourself culture. This applies not just to its craft beer breweries and independent coffee roasters: the tech community here was influential in the open-source software movement. Linux creator Linus Torvalds lives in the area, as does Ward Cunningham, who helped create the wiki technology.The case for: Those traditions of independence as well as affordable cost of living and relative proximity to California, have helped create a range of start-ups.Many in the Portland tech community have studied elsewhere, but Portland State University, Oregon State, and the University of Oregon have strong tech-related programmes. A number of start-ups have their genesis in the liberal arts Reed College.Compared with San Francisco, entrepreneurs say, life is good and cheap. Because of this and the idiosyncratic local culture, companies can work on building the right product, even if it takes longer — or if they feel what the world needs is not another consumer mobile app.The case against: Portland’s profile is low and will probably stay so. On the west coast, Los Angeles is much bigger, Seattle and Vancouver are formidable rivals, and most of the money is in Silicon Valley.So Portland is best for companies that love the city and their project, rather than those looking for quick rock star fame.

Local heroes: Companies that stand out in Portland include Puppet Labs, an IT automation company with customers around the world; Simple, an online banking service, now owned by Spain’s BBVA; Elemental Technologies, a video technology company that was bought last year by Amazon Web Services; and Cloudability, which helps customers with cloud-cost management.Show me the money: Sources of help starting out include the Portland Incubator Experiment, Portland Seed Fund, Startup PDX Challenge, Elevate Capital, Rogue Venture Partners, Oregon Angel Fund and Voyager Capital. However, there are few local options for later stage funds.Founders share tales from the entrepreneurial frontline with the FT’s Jonathan Moules as the popular podcast returns for a second series.The 10 episodes begin with the husband-and-wife team behind treetop adventure company Go Ape.Some companies have developed partnerships with a few big companies based in the area, such as Wieden+ Kennedy, the advertising company, and sportswear company Nike.What the locals say: “Portland is aggressively humble,” says Rick Turoczy, co-founder of the Portland Incubator Experiment. “People are working behind the scenes on infrastructure or framework that help other people do their work better . . . Not many companies are chasing unicorn valuations.”Compared with west coast cities Seattle and Vancouver, he adds, the culture is quality over quantity and sustainability over scale.“You need space and you need time for your ideas to incubate. You need fertile soil to germinate in . . . Portland still has a lot of that,” says Puppet Labs founder Luke Kanies. “But you can build something big, too.”"
137;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-28T13:11:43Z;Kenya athletics fights for its soul;One of the world’s athletics powerhouses has to struggles to overcome myriad drug-taking and corruption scandals;Kenyan MPs are interrupting their Easter recess on Tuesday to pass urgent legislation that will help one of the world’s athletics powerhouses overcome myriad drug-taking and corruption scandals. To comply with World Anti-Doping Agency regulations, Kenya’s parliament has until April 5 to pass a law enshrining the independence of the country’s newly-created anti-drugs body to catch athletes.Kenyan athletics has been rocked by allegations that threaten to further tarnish a sport that is racing to rebuild its credibility ahead of this year’s summer Olympics in Rio. In November, the International Association of Athletic Federations, the sport's governing body, banned Russia when evidence emerged of a years-long state-sponsored drug-taking programme. However, the IAAF says Kenya, which topped the medals table at last year’s world athletics championships but has seen some 40 athletes banned for doping in the past three years, is unlikely to suffer Russia’s fate if it fails to meet the Wada deadline. This is because the IAAF has given the African nation until the end of the year to comply with its rules. But while Kenyans will probably be allowed to compete even if Wada declares the country non-compliant and sponsors are unlikely to desert them, it will be an embarrassing blow to a nation that prides itself on its athletic prowess and hosts many foreigners at its high-altitude training camps.Kip Keino, a double Olympic athletics champion and chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said the nation needed to do more to “clean the house”. Mr Keino said: “We’re at the corner, we haven’t yet turned it. Any athletes and officials that have been involved in drug-taking or corruption have to be stopped and replaced. “We owe it to our nation’s youth to ensure all athletes who represent the country are clean.” The IAAF has suspended Isaiah Kiplagat, the president of Athletics Kenya, and two of his senior colleagues over “potential subversion of the anti-doping control process in Kenya” and corruption allegations, pending an investigation. The latter included reported misuse of hundreds of thousands of dollars in sponsorship money from Nike, the US sportswear company. The IAAF has separately suspended Isaac Mwangi, Athletics Kenya’s chief executive, after he was accused of demanding bribes by two banned female athletes to help have their four-year doping suspensions reduced. Nike has not been accused of corruption but Kenyan athletes campaigning to clean up Athletics Kenya say the company should have been concerned about what might happen to its money when it agreed to pay a $500,000 unspecified “commitment bonus” and $100,000 annual honorariums as part of a sponsorship deal signed five years ago.Last November the Professional Athletes Association of Kenya staged a two-day demonstration at the Athletics Kenya headquarters to raise awareness of alleged impropriety at the organisation. Julius Ndegwa, the PAAK secretary who claims Athletics Kenya officials have routinely asked him for bribes, said: “We believe they were pocketing the Nike money rather than using it to help athletes. We had to raise the red flag against them and their evil deeds.” Nike declined to respond to requests for information on the contract or the payment. The accused Kenyan officials have insisted they are innocent and Jackson Tuwei, the acting Athletics Kenya president, told the FT there was “no corruption in Athletics Kenya”. He declined to discuss the cases being investigated. “They’re allegations, nothing more,” he said. “We’re clean and our books are audited every financial year.” However, he was unable to explain why sponsorship money was moved to officials’ personal accounts or why he was using Mr Kiplagat’s email address, dismissing the latter as “an administrative error”. On Kenya’s attempts to meet Wada’s regulations, Mr Tuwei said “reasonable progress” had been made. “The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya has been formed, the necessary policies have been formulated and the bill [enshrining Kenya’s anti-doping framework] has been sent to parliament,” he said. Ben Nichols, a Wada spokesman, said the agency was highly likely to declare Kenya non-compliant if the law had not been ratified. “This has been a long process and we’ve been patient,” he said. “This can be seen as a final deadline.” However, he stressed that Wada did not want to see any nation banned from international competition. “Our goal is to get nations such as Kenya fully compliant,” he said.

On a currency-neutral basis, sales advanced 14 per cent.Nike also said it expects its revenues to rise at a “high single-digit rate” in the fiscal year to May 2017, which is on the “conservative” end of the spectrum, said UBS analyst Michael Binetti. Analysts were looking for fiscal 2017 sales growth of about 10 per cent.In a silver lining, Nike’s quarterly profits climbed to $950m, or 55 cents a share, from $791m, or 45 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts expected profits of 49 cents.Nike’s shares, which surged by almost a third in 2015, fell 3.8 per cent on Tuesday to $62.45, leaving them roughly flat for the year.Shares of Under Armour, which competes in the same industry, fell 1.8 per cent to $82.90.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 energy sector dropped 2.1 per cent, making it by far the biggest laggard of the main indices, amid a decline in the price of oil.US crude fell 4 per cent to $39.79 after the energy department said American oil inventories rose far more than expected last week.The news was the latest reminder that the global supply glut persists despite the stabilisation in oil prices.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 9.9 per cent to $10.19. Chevron, an oil major, declined 2 per cent to $93.61.Miners also came under pressure as the price of copper, aluminium and gold all declined.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner, dropped 11.3 per cent to $9.75.

Sales rose 8 per cent to $8bn.Wall Street analysts expected profits of 49 cents a share on sales of $8.2bn.Nike said a strong dollar weighed on its revenues, and that they would have increased 14 per cent on a currency neutral basis. Nike brand sales rose 15 per cent on the same basis to $7.6bn, while Converse brand sales fell 5 per cent to $489m.Futures orders for Nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from March 2016 to July 2016, which give an indication of expected demand and are closely watched by analysts, climbed 12 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Excluding the effects of a strong dollar, the figure advanced 17 per cent, beating Wall Street estimates of a 16.1 per cent rise.Nike shares have posted a stunning run over the past few years, rallying 30 per cent in 2015, and 22.3 per cent the year before that. But they have risen less than 4 per cent this year as investors have taken a more cautious tone on last year’s high-fliers.Nike’s shares fell 4.4 per cent in extended trading on Tuesday.

Reports on European economies will also garner attention.FedspeakThe Fed last Wednesday surprised many economists by forecasting just two quarter-point rate rises this year, down from an estimate of four in December.The dovish outlook sent the dollar skidding 1.1 per cent for the week against a basket of global currencies. The decline gave commodities a lift, which in turn helped the S&P 500 turn positive for 2016 for the first time.James Bullard, head of the St Louis Fed and a voting member of the central bank’s policy-setting board, is among the policymakers set to speak. Charles Evans, the Chicago Fed’s president and an alternate member on the FOMC, is also set to deliver a speech.Fed officials often provide their own economic forecasts and policy outlooks at public events, meaning they will be closely watched as investors look for clues on how the central bank may move next.European dataThere are a slew of important reports due out from Europe this week.Consumer prices in the UK are forecast to have climbed 0.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in February, up slightly from a 0.3 per cent pace the month prior. Excluding the food and energy components, the rate is expected to have held steady at 1.2 per cent in February.While inflation in the UK remains below the Bank of England’s inflation target of 2 per cent, it is dramatically better than many economies in continental Europe that face the spectre of deflation.Surveys on investor and business sentiment in Germany, the eurozone’s powerhouse economy, are also due out. The Ifo Institute’s survey of business sentiment is expected to have perked up this month as companies take a brighter view of the future. The Zew gauge of investor confidence is also forecast to have risen.Nike earningsNike, a US maker of athletic footwear, is set to post its fiscal third quarter results on Tuesday. The stock was one of 2015′s top performers, soaring by almost a third. But its stock price has stagnated this year as investors have shunned many of Wall Street’s high-fliers.The Dow component is expected to post a 9.4 per cent increase in its quarterly profits as sales race ahead by almost 10 per cent.US economyThere are several closely-watched reports due out that could help shed additional light on how the US economy is performing after starting the year on a sluggish note.The durable goods report, due on Thursday, is forecast to show orders for long-lasting goods having slid three per cent in February after soaring 4.7 per cent the month prior. Excluding the volatile transportation components, orders may have dipped 0.3 per cent.The report gives insight into the health of the American industrial sector and also the strength of capital spending across the economy. It also often figures into the gross domestic product estimates of Wall Street investment banks.There are also a duo of reports due out on the housing market, covering reports for newly-built and previously-owned homes.

emerging markets.Nike has been boosted by strong sales at home, Europe and China, and by further inroads made in direct sales to consumers via its bricks and mortar stores and online. Earnings are forecast to have risen 9.7 per cent to
49 cents a share.Nike is targeting a rise in online sales from $1.5bn to $7bn a year by 2020, as demand at its own stores in cities continues to build.It is also bucking a trend brought about by the warmer US winter this year. While apparel retailers such as department stores and Dick’s Sporting Goods — which stocks the Nike brand — have recorded disappointing sales, Nike appears to be maintaining an increase in domestic demand.Investors will look for the company’s forecast order growth for the period from March 16 to July 16.

142;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-16T23:41:42Z;Boards should learn from Sharapova;‘Cheat until you are caught’ is a bad mission statement for athletes and boards;Watching tennis star Maria Sharapova lose many of her sponsorship deals after admitting to taking a banned drug made me think of companies who lose the faith of their shareholders after being caught cheating.The International Tennis Federation, supported by the World Anti-Doping Agency, declared last December that meldonium was to be banned. Sharapova may have received the memo, like Volkswagen’s former chief executive Martin Winterkorn, and simply failed to read it. She tested positive for the drug in January.It was a costly episode. Sponsors Porsche, Nike and Tag Heuer have cut their links to the star, although Danone, owner of the Evian water brand, and Head, her racquet maker, have stuck by her so far. Forbes magazine estimated Sharapova earned $23m through endorsements last year.Boards cannot claim that they did not know the rules have been changed. They are obliged to make sure they are up to date with the latest regulatory or legislative moves. They have to put in place structures which ensure information flows through to them at the right time. Not for them the excuse of nonchalance and inattention to detail of Team Sharapova.Of course, the temptation for boards will be to turn a blind eye to the rules, or to try and interpret them in a way that suits them.UBS and Deutsche Bank hoped that their tax-avoiding bonus scheme of over a decade ago complied with UK tax law. But last week the Supreme Court decided the offshore vehicles that sheltered bankers from income tax and national insurance payments were not legitimate. The banks are now facing a tax bill that towers over any losses that Sharapova may suffer.Business and sport have this in common too: competition is intense at the highest level. The difference between winning and losing may be small. In these circumstances every little adjustment may be crucial. But that does not mean you should go too far, whether in altering the emissions data of your vehicles or by benefiting unfairly from enhanced endurance and shorter recovery times after athletic performance.Perhaps boards would act more wisely if they knew that a business equivalent of the World Anti-Doping Agency existed to monitor them — although the presence of the watchdog has not deterred all ambitious young athletes from trying their luck.“Cheat until you get caught” is a bad mission statement for businesses and athletes. The inspectors are becoming cleverer and the rules are catching up. Do not ask what you can get away with. Complying grudgingly with a legalistic minimum will eventually lose you the game and very possibly end your career — athletic or otherwise.Stefan Stern is director of the High Pay Centre, which tracks executive pay
143;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-11T21:58:44Z;Week in Review, March 12;Investment banks, G4S, United Airlines, German utilities and Maria Sharapova’s sponsors in the news;"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.US investment banks widen lead over European rivalsThe decline of Europe’s investment banks was laid bare this week, as analysis by the Financial Times showed how dramatically they lagged behind their US peers last year, writes Laura Noonan.Revenues for the top five European investment banks were less than half of the $138.5bn made by their top five US rivals, their financial statements show. Pre-tax profits at the European groups’ investment banking and securities divisions were $4.2bn in 2015, a figure dwarfed by the $33.5bn the Americans earned.Experts agree that conditions favoured the US banks last year, as a rebounding American economy triggered a wave of M&A activity and fundraising that delivered a bounty of fees for Citigroup, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.But the Americans had more than good fortune on their side — they are also reaping the rewards of reshaping their businesses earlier in the financial crisis, a process Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are only now getting stuck into.Leading executives at the European banks argue that their restructurings will make them “more focused” than US banks, helping them to claw back market share in areas such as advisory and capital markets.Credit Suisse is hiring more bankers for this — even as group chief executive
Tidjane Thiam pursues annual cost savings of SFr2bn ($2bn) across the entire Credit Suisse businesses.UBS, which embarked on its major restructuring in 2012, is taking on more bankers in the US, and Deutsche Bank is targeting growth in its advisory and capital markets businesses.Still, the Americans are quietly confident of retaining their global crown.They now dominate the fees league tables even in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, so they are well-positioned to benefit from the long-awaited uptick in the European economy.Their sheer size and breadth allows them to serve clients right across the globe in a way that is increasingly impossible for the shrinking Europeans, giving them a powerful marketing unique selling point.● Related Banking Weekly podcast: An ethical review, European investment banks shrink and the oil threat to US banksRWE and Eon feel the heat as groups report lossesThis week was another difficult one for European utilities, with the German companies Eon and RWE both reporting a slump in results, writes Kiran Stacey.RWE said on Tuesday that Npower, its UK business, had lost €137m last year and would shed 2,400 jobs — a fifth of its workforce.RWE blamed the loss on “serious process and system-related problems” in billing, which affected more than 500,000 customers between September 2013 and December 2014. Npower was fined a record £26m by Ofgem, the energy regulator, last year over its failure to treat customers fairly.RWE has been struggling with the same difficulties faced by other German power groups, whose profit margins at gas- and coal-fired plants have been squeezed as the government moves towards renewables.Peter Terium, RWE chief executive, said that with the German wholesale electricity price of about €20 per megawatt hour, coal and gas-fired power stations could not survive.“We cannot expect any lasting improvement in this dramatic situation in the foreseeable future,” he added. “There is no rapid recovery of wholesale electricity prices in sight.”Eon gave another indication of these problems on Wednesday, when it said it would write down the value of its coal and gas stations by €8.8bn. That led to the company’s biggest ever net loss of €7bn, more than double the €3.2bn loss recorded in 2014.Johannes Teyssen, the chief executive, said the downturn it faced would be “tougher and longer than anticipated”.Sharapova drug admission plays poorly with sponsorsMaria Sharapova, the world’s highest earning female sports star, lost three key corporate sponsors this week but had one reconfirm its support, after the Russian tennis player admitted failing a drug test, writes John Murray Brown.Nike, the US sportswear group, said it was “saddened and surprised” and had decided to suspend its relationship after the former Wimbledon champion revealed she had tested positive for a banned substance following the Australian Open in January.TAG Heuer, the Swiss watch brand owned by luxury company LVMH, followed suit while Porsche, the German carmaker, said it would “postpone planned activities” with the player until further details were released.Head, the racket maker, said it planned to extend its contract, however, and commended as admirable “the honesty and courage she displayed in announcing and acknowledging her mistake”.Ms Sharapova receives more than $20m a year in endorsements, a figure that is six times larger than her 2015 winnings on court.The sponsorship deals give companies image rights and access to the star’s social media audience. The tennis player has more than 15m followers on Facebook and 2m on Twitter.But scandals have left sponsors nervous about the value of relationships with sports and athletes.Some commentators were surprised by the speed of the sponsors’ reaction, however, suggesting the scandal was being used to ditch a client, who earns huge fees but is a fading star on court.Ms Sharapova, who could face a four-year ban under the sport’s rules, said she had been taking the drug meldonium — under its alternative name, mildronate — for the past 10 years for health reasons and had not known it was banned.Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned substances on January 1.● Related Short View column: Signs of life behind the roubleG4S exits Israel as profits plunge and blunders buildG4S is the biggest security company in the world but it still sets alarm bells ringing with surprising frequency — a record it added to this week as it announced a fall in profits, writes Gill Plimmer.The company mismanaged the guarding of the 2012 London Olympic Games and was later forced to admit it had charged the UK government for electronically tagging criminals who were already dead. More recently, staff were caught on camera allegedly abusing teenagers at a youth offenders institute in Kent, south-east England.The noise has finally got to Ashley Almanza, the publicity-shy head brought in to restore the company’s fortunes in 2013.G4S has already exited a contract to clean the US detention centre at Guantánamo Bay and on Wednesday said it would quit Israel, where it employs 8,000 staff, some of whom install security equipment at prisons in the West Bank.Pro-Palestinian campaign groups, which have pursued their cause in human rights tribunals, declared the announcement their victory.Mr Almanza may be hoping the change in strategy will buy a quieter life. But a lossmaking contract housing asylum seekers in Britain has cost it £31m and may leave it with a further £57m bill by the end of the decade.With pre-tax profits falling 40 per cent to £78m in 2015, and cash flow down 13 per cent to £460m, it is the debt that is increasing — up £143m to nearly £1.8bn last year. As the share price hovers around 183p, its lowest since autumn 2008, it is investors who are now clamouring for attention.● Related Lex note: Safety in numbersBethune put forward amid United shareholders’ revoltGordon Bethune, the man credited with the rescue of Continental Airlines, became involved in a shareholder battle at its successor company this week, write FT reporters.He was one of six candidates nominated to join the board of United Airlines, which was formed in 2010 from the merger of United and Continental.All of the candidates were put forward by two United shareholders who have accused the company of “substantial and inexcusable . . . underperformance” in the US aviation market.The campaign also highlights the tough start Oscar Munoz is having as chief executive of United Airlines.Next week, he is due to return to work after nearly five months away following a heart attack. When he suffered health problems last October, he had been United’s top manager for less than six weeks.He replaced Jeff Smisek, who was forced to stand down amid a federal investigation into allegations that United bestowed favours on the former chairman of the New York and New Jersey port authority, owner of the area’s three airports.Altimeter Capital and PAR Capital — the two United shareholders behind the proxy battle, with 7.1 per cent of the stock of the airline’s parent company — say “meaningful change” is needed. In a letter to the chairman, Henry Meyer, they criticised “longstanding poor board governance” and “years of substantial and inexcusable underperformance relative to United’s competitors”. United is less profitable than American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, its two main peers.Mr Meyer said United had attempted a dialogue with the two shareholders, and was “deeply disappointed” that they had taken “this hostile action” — warning it could distract the company from its strategic plan.● Related video: Airlines face pilot shortage crisis"
144;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-11T13:13:09Z;Why lose money if celebrities lose face?;Sharapova drug test highlights the value of ‘disgrace insurance’;For the tennis racket maker Head, this week’s revelation that its poster girl, Maria Sharapova, had tested positive for a banned drug was doubly bad news. Not only is it now sponsoring a player who may not be allowed to compete for years, but it will also find it harder to claim recompense if she gets into trouble again.Welcome to the arcane world of “disgrace insurance” — where the more tarnished the celebrity endorsing your product, the harder it is to win a payout.Ms Sharapova’s admission that she had taken the banned endurance-enhancing substance meldonium has highlighted a growing and lucrative market in disgrace insurance for prominent corporate sponsors.Brokers report rapid growth in this niche market in recent times, with businesses paying millions to insure against damage to their sales and reputation, in the wake of several high-profile celebrity scandals.In addition to the failings of Ms Sharapova — who was this week dropped by sponsors Nike, Porsche and TAG Heuer (but not Head) — the personal crises of golfer Tiger Woods, cyclist Lance Armstrong and supermodel Kate Moss have all damaged their commercial backers.Duncan Fraser, senior partner at insurance broker JLT Specialty, says the number of companies buying disgrace insurance has risen by at least 30 per cent in the past three years. This has helped to boost the total value of all contingency and accident premiums paid at Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance market, to more than £500m.“Celebrity endorsements can do wonders for a brand,” Mr Fraser says. “But a very highly publicised fall from grace can expose businesses to unwanted publicity and possibly result in lost revenue.”Alastair MacLean, contingency underwriter at insurance agency Ark Syndicate, adds: “The growth in social media means that news and stories can spread very quickly. This has meant there has been a greater demand for protection.”Several well known insurers — including Munich Re, Ark Syndicate, Hiscox, Swiss Re, XL Catlin, Beazley, Talbot and Markel — now provide specialist cover, and underwrite the market.Policies can be individually tailored to reflect a company’s confidence in a celebrity. For example, for sponsorship contracts ranging from £1m to £50m, policies can be designed to reimburse the full amount to the sponsoring company in the event of a misdemeanour by the celebrity, or pay out on a sliding scale, depending on the nature of the incident.Premiums vary, but brokers say they tend to start at 0.25 per cent of the sum insured, or just under 1 per cent, on average, for more bespoke arrangements.Cover can also be arranged for different types of risk. One of the main types is loss of profit, if customers stop buying certain products in the wake of a celebrity’s disgrace.“When celebrities are linked with products, you’d expect a [positive] impact on sales,” argues Tom Hoad, head of innovation at insurance group Tokio Marine Kiln. “So when a brand ambassador goes wrong, you can expect a negative impact on sales. We can insure the loss of profit arising from a celebrity disgrace type incident.”Another type of insurance covers the cost of advertising. A company might have spent millions upfront on a campaign, only to have to pull it halfway through if a featured celebrity does something wrong.“We’ll insure the costs of the campaign and we’d pay for the part of it that was not used,” says Chris Rackliffe, who heads the contingency team at insurance agency Beazley.But, as with all insurance, it pays to read the small print and understand the factors that determine the success of a claim. “If someone has a squeaky clean image, the threshold for disgrace is lower than it would be for a hellraiser,” Mr Rackliffe explains.

I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game.”A rash of sports scandals has left sponsors increasingly nervous about the value of their deals with sports and individual athletes. Last month, Fifa, world football’s governing body, said its troubles had left a $550m hole in its budget through lost commercial opportunities. Adidas, the sportswear group, has ended its sponsorship deal with the IAAF, the world athletics body plagued by doping scandals.Nike alone has cancelled deals with Oscar Pistorious, the South African Paralympian convicted of killing his girlfriend, Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxer who made homophobic comments, Lance Armstrong, the cycling drug cheat, and Ray Rice, the American football player who physically abused his wife.Ms Sharapova said she had been taking the drug under its alternative name, mildronate, for the past 10 years for health reasons and that she had not known the substance was banned.Meldonium was added on January 1 to the list of substances banned by the International Tennis Federation, world tennis’s governing body, following a decision last September.The ITF said it would suspend Ms Sharapova with effect from Saturday March 12, pending “determination” of the case.Guidelines from the body call for a four-year suspension in the event of a positive drug test, although this can be reduced for first-time offences or if the player bears no fault or negligence.Nike said it was “saddened and surprised” by the news. “We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues,” it said in a statement.Ms Sharapova has long been considered sport’s biggest female brand, topping Forbes’ ranking of the world’s highest-paid female athletes in each of the past 11 years.TAG Heuer said in a statement: “Maria Sharapova was under contract with TAG Heuer until December 31, 2015. We had been in talks to extend our collaboration. In view of the current situation, the Swiss watch brand has suspended negotiations and has decided not to renew the contract.”Porsche said: “We regret the current news about Maria Sharapova. Until further details emerge and we are able to analyse the situation, we have decided to suspend planned activities.”The star is also sponsored by Evian, owned by French group Danone, which also said it was “surprised” by the announcement. The tie-up with Evian began in 2012 and Danone said that “until now, we have maintained a trustworthy, professional relationship. Evian attaches great importance to health, integrity and to transparency, and we will follow closely the development of the investigation.”Avon, another sponsor, declined to comment.Ms Sharapova receives more than $20m in annual endorsements, a figure that dwarfs her 2015 prize money by a multiple of six.The deals gave the companies image rights for billboards and magazines, and also access to Ms Sharapova’s vast presence on social media. The tennis player has more than 15m followers on Facebook and 2m on Twitter, as well as having her own app.John Haggerty, Ms Sharapova’s lawyer, said she “did not pick up” that the substance was banned at the time of the Melbourne tournament, where she lost in the quarter-finals to world number one Serena Williams.“We are attempting to have a conversation with ITF up front because we think there is a laundry list of extremely mitigating circumstances that once taken into consideration would result in dramatically reducing any sanction that they might want to impose on Maria,” he told the US magazine Sports Illustrated.Patrick Nally, a consultant specialising in sports marketing, said he had been a little surprised at the speed with which some sponsors were dropping her.“She has taken the initiative and been upfront, holding a press conference,” he said. “But it’s clearly a cheap way for a sponsor to get out of an arrangement. All companies and brands are nervous at the moment and I suppose they want to distance themselves from another drug scandal.”Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, was quoted by the country’s Tass news agency saying on Tuesday that there would be more cases of Russian sports people using meldonium. He also said the ministry had warned Russian sports people that meldonium was outlawed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.Ms Sharapova is not the first sports star to be dropped by Nike in recent weeks.The group ended its contract with Philippine boxing hero Manny Pacquiao last month after he described same-sex couples as “worse than animals”, comments that Nike described as “abhorrent”.Meldonium, also known as mildronate, was developed by the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis during the 1970s as a treatment for ischemia — restricted blood flow around the body, writes Clive Cookson.Today, meldonium is manufactured by Grindeks, a leading Latvian pharmaceutical company, and prescribed extensively in Russia and eastern Europe although it is not licensed in the US and western Europe.The World Anti Doping Agency said it monitored meldonium on the basis of “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance”. Wada decided to add the drug to its prohibited list of metabolic modulators in September and the ban came into effect on January 1 2016.Grindeks says on its website that mildronate is “widely used for the treatment of different heart and vascular diseases, as well as for the improvement of work capacity of healthy people at physical and mental overloads”.Researchers at Germany’s Centre for Preventive Doping Research in Cologne last year reported in the professional journal Drug Testing and Analysis that meldonium “demonstrates an increase in endurance performance of athletes, improved rehabilitation after exercise, protection against stress, and enhanced activations of central nervous system (CNS) functions”.Maria Sharapova is not the only Russian athlete to have tested positive for meldonium this year. Ice dancer Ekaterina Bobrova (pictured), an Olympic gold medallist, said on Monday that she had pulled out of the World Figure Skating Championships, to be held in Boston later this month, after the drug had been detected in her blood.Last month the cyclist Eduard Vorganov was provisionally suspended by the sport’s governing body, Union Cycliste Internationale, after a test showed traces of meldonium.Twitter: @bryanhimself
146;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-08T13:28:59Z;The savvy Maria Sharapova is aware of her diminishing returns;The deciding point could be that tennis and its backers can do without her, writes Andrew Hill;"“She is very savvy, she is a very smart businesswoman — and she understands return on investment,” Max Eisenbud, Maria Sharapova’s agent, told the Financial Times in 2015. Nobody, in other words, can be more acutely aware of the impact on her returns of failing a drugs test than Ms Sharapova herself.The $20m of sponsorship she receives — a multiple of her prize money — is dwindling fast. Nike, with which the tennis star has a long-term deal, has suspended its contract. Tag Heuer, the watchmaker, says it will not renew its backing. Others will doubtless follow.It is possible the sponsors have overreacted. According to one piece of research, only “high blame” celebrity incidents — wife-beating, reckless driving — tend to damage the brand on the stock market. Low blame events, such as injury, increase sympathy with the athlete and may even boost the sponsor’s market returns.“Missing the memo” is no excuse in the commercial world — witness the scorn poured on Martin Winterkorn, former Volkswagen chief executive, after VW announced he had received, if not read, early warning of the emissions scandal. But if fans give Ms Sharapova the benefit of the doubt for not realising that the drug she had been taking was now banned, her reputation, and that of the products she endorses, could yet bounce back.The blunt commercial fact, however, is that when brands calculate they can do without tainted stars, they usually give them the chop; if they think the returns outweigh the scandal, they keep them on.Note, for instance, how Nike granted a new sponsorship deal to US sprinter Justin Gatlin in 2015, despite the fact he had served two doping bans. A tennis star who has admitted she is nearing the end of her career (and has, in any case, always played in the shadow of world number one Serena Williams) is a diminishing asset to the sportswear group compared with an athlete still at his peak.When it comes to endorsements by tainted celebrities, brands turn out to be remarkably durable. It is the players who are fragile. One 2011 study found that endorsements generated a 4 per cent increase in turnover of branded products and a measurable jump in stock returns. Nike is “savvy” enough to have a succession plan in place: a shortlist of up-and-coming players to replace the current generation of ageing male and female stars. It is likely to regard any downward lurch in Ms Sharapova’s brand value as a rounding error in the medium term.Her personal brands, which she sees as an insurance policy against declining commercial endorsements, are more vulnerable. Apart from anything else, the Russian-born player’s admission that she was taking the now-banned drug in part because of a family history of diabetes must complicate promotion of Sugarpova, her range of candy.“Believe me, I will be very happy when I finish. There will be no regrets,” Ms Sharapova told the FT last year. If punishment for her lapse ends her career prematurely, she may revisit the second part of that statement. It is a cruel reality that tennis and its commercial backers can do without Ms Sharapova. Whether she can do without tennis is a different matter.andrew.hill@ft.com"

148;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-03-03T12:39:41Z;Adidas: go-faster stripes;Improving margins is top of the new CEO’s in-tray. But how best to do it?;"The margin between victory and defeat on the sports field is often narrow. For German sportswear group Adidas, narrow margins are a problem off the field, too. Back in 2010, its business plan called for operating margins of 11 per cent by 2015. Full-year results published on Thursday showed them at 6.5 per cent. Kasper Rorsted, who takes over as chief executive this year, has plenty to do.An obvious first move would be to sell the golf division, TaylorMade adidas-Golf, where sales fell 13 per cent (at unchanged exchanges rates) during 2015. Its future is already under review; based on the valuation of US-listed Callaway, TaylorMade could fetch perhaps €800m. However, while there are plenty of valid reasons to sell TaylorMade, it is only 5 per cent of sales so the effect of a disposal on margins would be limited. Selling Reebok, another underperformer, would have more impact but Reebok’s sales and profits are at least growing and it is more integral to the group.More durable results would come from cutting running costs. Gross margins at Adidas are similar to US rivals but at the operating level margins are lower. Assuming that its higher marketing spend (14 per cent of sales) is sacrosanct, that leaves about €4.9bn of other costs. Adidas says they will fall this year. They need to: they were 29 per cent of sales in 2015, compared with 22 per cent at Nike.Another long-term problem lurks in Mr Rorsted’s in-tray: North America. The rate of sales growth there last year was half that of Latin America and a third of European and Chinese levels. Profit fell two-fifths and Adidas has lost its number two spot in the US, the world’s biggest market, to Under Armour.The bad news is that the sheer size of the US market means Adidas would need to take a lot of market share in places such as China to offset continued attrition in the US. The good news is that operational gearing means small improvements in sales there would provide a strong boost to profit.Mr Rorsted’s labours will be made easier by Adidas’s forecast 10-12 per cent sales growth this year (helped by major sporting events). But his record has not gone unnoticed. Since his appointment was announced, Adidas shares have risen 18 per cent, beating the Dax, and the valuation gap with Nike has narrowed. Two activist investors have been given supervisory board seats. No pressure, then.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
149;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-02-24T05:03:09Z;Philanthropy: Stanford University’s school for world leaders;Nike founder Philip Knight’s $400m gift will help fund scholarship aimed at solving global problems;If there is one commodity that never seems to be in short supply in Silicon Valley, it’s ambition.The call to “change the world” has become a common rallying cry for the region’s start-ups, and a mark of the techno-euphoria that pervades the San Francisco bay area at the height of one of its periodic booms.So it should be no surprise that Stanford University, the private institution that sits at the heart of the Valley and has supplied a fair amount of its talent and research ideas, has been bitten by the ambition bug.At $750m, it has just raised what it claims is the biggest amount to have been set aside for a fully endowed acad­emic scholarship programme. This inc­ludes a $400m contribution from Nike founder Philip Knight, coming on top of a $105m donation he had already made to the university’s business school.A further $100m has come from local financier Robert King and his wife Dorothy, and is in addition to the $150m the pair had already given to study ways of alleviating poverty in the developing world, itself one of the biggest single contributions in Stanford’s history.The large numbers demonstrate the scale of the project Stanford has now taken on with its new Knight-Hennessy scholarships: to help train a network of future global leaders, with an international schol­arship programme for 100 new grad­uate students a year from around the world that is modelled on — yet dwarfs — established schemes such as the Rhodes Scholarships.$750mTotal amount raised for Knight-Hennessy scholarship programmeJohn Hennessy, the Stanford president who came up with this idea, is unabash­ed about the breadth of his vision: “You want to have a big impact, you need to do something at scale.”On the board of Google since before its 2004 initial public offering, and a director of Cisco Systems, Mr Hennessy knows all about the Silicon Valley ap­proach to thinking big. Asked if that hassomething to do with why he has raised so much cash, he does not hesitate: “Ab­solutely. The Valley is fundamentally about innovation, and being willing to approach things in new ways, being able to come up with solutions at scale.”I wouldn’t be unhappy if I sent a really great ethical leader to Wall Street. I would feel OK about thatYet the plan to turn out an elite group of leaders to take on some of the world’s most difficult problems, from climate change to improving health and education for large populations, marks a departure from the usual Silicon Valley way of looking at the world. The typical tech entrepreneur is better known for single-minded pursuit of a narrowly focused idea, usual­ly in a fast-moving start-up and with little thought for the wider social impact of their disruptive notions.What Stanford hopes to instil in its Knight-Hennessy scholars is different: the collection of skills needed to solve big and complex problems, often by working in large institutions and drawing on the public as well as private sector. “I think this is harder to do at scale,” Mr Hennessy concedes. “It’s harder to do when you involve the public sector, there’s no doubt about it: it’s not trivial.”100 x 3One hundred graduate students a year will sign up for the three-year programmeWhen it comes to trying to attract the best candidates from around the world, though, Stanford is not shy about using the Silicon Valley mystique as a recruiting tool. The students it attracts will go into one of its existing graduate prog­rammes, from law and business to medicine and engineering, but they will all be taught innovation and entrepreneurialism.Students might also get to spend their vacations working at a Google or a Facebook, says Mr Hennessy. “Being in the Valley, being on the Pacific Rim, is really a very different experience.”Yet proximity to Silicon Valley’s tech start-up culture is only part of the draw. “Not everything is going to be the next new app to solve the entire problem — it’s a larger scale, it’s a more collaborative venture,” says Mr Hennessy. “Technology has a role but it’s not the single silver bullet.”To achieve its aim of a more rounded education, Stanford is counting on an interdisciplinary approach that has been one of the hallmarks of Mr Hennessy’s 16 years as president. The univ­ersity’s graduate students have been encouraged to dip into courses beyond their narrow specialisms.The scholarship programme will also inc­lude a new course in leadership. Conceding that leadership skills are learned by experience, rather than in the classroom, Mr Hennessy thinks Stanford can still devise a set of experiences that have some real-world value.The university is also set to build a centre where the new graduate students can congregate, cementing an elite network that is an essential part of the programme.The backers of the Knight-Hennessy programme hope this combination of experiences — and a three-year duration that is longer than other, similar schemes — will produce well-rounded, ethically minded people with an appetite for solving hard social problems. “I want people who are inspired to go into public service, who are inspired to go start the next great NGO,” says Mr Hennessy, who will retire from Stanford this summer and become the first director for the scholarship programme.Despite their lofty aims, though, elite scholarship programmes are sometimes seen as feeder systems for high-paid professions, turning out fewer of the high-minded, public-spirited individuals they are intended to produce.“We’re unlikely to get 300 for 300,” concedes Mr Knight, referring to the number of students who will be on the scholarship programme at any one time. But over a two-decade period, the scholarships should still produce an im­pressive and diverse set of leaders, he adds — while those that choose more conventional careers, such as banking or law, may still move into public service later.Highly selective scholarship prog­rammes also run into criticism for breeding personal networks that serve the interests of the members more than society at large.After 16 years at the helm of one of the top-ranked US private universities, Mr Hennessy is un­apologetic about the risk of being seen as exclusive. “The criticism is probably one that is not just of these scholarship programmes but all elite institutions,” he says, before adding: “Our challenge is to inspire people to think differently.”So how will he feel if Knight-Hennessy scholars shun the aspirations of the programme’s founders and instead join the brain-drain to more highly paid and less altruistic careers, like finance?He cannot resist a sly sideswipe. “I wouldn’t be unhappy if I sent a real­ly great ethical leader to Wall Street,” he says. “I would feel OK about that.”After a spate of big personal donations, elite graduate scholarships for top international students are less rare than they once were. Recent benefactors include Bill Gates, who gave $210m in 2000 to set up a programme at Cambridge university. Private equity baron Stephen Schwarzman put up $100m of the $300m for a programme at Tsinghua University, Beijing.Most draw to some degree on the idea behind the Rhodes Scholarships, which were set up by Cecil Rhodes in 1902 and remain the gold standard, although the programme has been beset recently by controversy over Rhodes’s colonialism.“We haven’t necessarily sensed a gap in the market,” Mr Hennessy says diplomatically. “We have great admiration for what Rhodes has done, and there’s a little bit of emulation here.”Despite the nod to academic harmony, there is a competitive edge. Knight-Hennessy starts with more than twice the financial resources of any rival programme. It will also have nearly twice as many scholars as the Rhodes. And it will have at least one big difference from the scholarships that bring international students to Oxford and Cambridge universities, says Mr Hennessy: British students will also be able to apply.
150;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-02-24T05:02:11Z;Nike founder’s $400m thrusts Stanford into global leadership race;Donation is largest contribution to $750m fund for elite graduate sponsorship scheme;Nike founder Philip Knight has given $400m to Stanford University, equalling the largest individual donation to a US college, for an international programme to draw potential world leaders to Silicon Valley.The donation marks the largest contribution to a $750m fund for an elite graduate scholarship scheme to rival established programmes such as the 114-year-old Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford university, whose alumni include former president Bill Clinton.Growing competition to attract and train future political and business leaders from around the world has produced a spate of well-financed scholarship schemes in recent years, with billionaires lining up to back the idea.Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, put $210m behind a two-year scholarship programme that bears his name at Cambridge university, while Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive officer of investment firm Blackstone, has given $100m towards a one-year programme at Beijing’s Tsinghua University that begins this year.Stanford is set to top these in ambition, taking 100 students a year for three year graduate degrees that it claims will shape them to take on some of the world’s most complex and challenging social issues.“We were struck by the need for better leadership around the world,” said John Hennessy, the president of Stanford, who came up with the idea. “We thought leaders need to be educated in a different way because you’re not going to solve these really hard problems. Whether it’s climate change, growing income disparity, poverty, corruption, you’re not going to solve them by just having a narrow background.”Mr Knight, who had already given large amounts to Stanford and the University of Oregon, said he had a “soft spot for education” and had been persuaded by Mr Hennessy’s vision of being able to train an elite group to make a real difference to the world. “I come from a world view that management and leadership matters — individual leaders can make a large difference,” he said.While expecting to draw a third of its students from the US, the programme is intended to pull promising talent from around the world, with a strong focus on Asia and developing countries in other regions, according to its founders.Stanford said it would start taking applications for the programme, known as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars, in the middle of 2017, with the first scholars admitted in the autumn of 2018.

Other members — described as “UK and global business leaders” — will be announced later.Jeremy Corbyn has been widely criticised for a perceived anti-business stance since he became leader of the party in September, an image he reinforced when he initially ignored invitations to meet business groups including the CBI.Both Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, are committed socialists who are seen as being on the “hard left” of the party.In recent weeks, however, Labour’s senior figures have attempted to repair some of the damage by setting up meetings with the business world to explore common ground on issues such as skills and infrastructure.Ms Eagle, in particular, is seen by business groups as a pragmatic figure, having served in the Treasury under Gordon Brown.The shadow business secretary said her new group would help Labour to “reach out” and build partnerships with business people to devise policies for a “shared capitalism”.Mr Watson said he had been “talking to a number of people” about joining the board and was optimistic about finding a “diverse” group to sit on it.“The conversations I’ve had have been positive,” he said. “People realise that the second-largest party in the UK needs to have a very strong position on business and economic growth.”It is common practice for opposition parties to hire a familiar figure from the business world in an attempt to boost their credibility.Under Ed Miliband Labour recruited figures including Bill Grimsey, former head of Iceland, Mike Wright, director of Jaguar Land Rover, and Sir John Armitt, former chair of the Olympic Delivery Authority.Mr Watson, who joined Labour after the 2010 general election — and gave £33,000 before the last election — is not a household name. But he was recently listed as the ninth most influential business leader on the FT’s LGBT power list.Since the banking crash of 2008 he has been a critic of “weak regulation” in parts of the banking industry.Uphold, formerly called “BitReserve”, was set up as a bitcoin wallet and exchange. Since then it has switched to being a broader online financial provider. The group, based in South Carolina, US, has raised close to $20m in seed capital and has 56,000 customers.Mr Watson, based in London, said it was reasonable for the government to expect business to pay its “fair share for an equal society”.He said that he was in favour of Britain staying in the EU but criticised both sides of the EU debate for “scare tactics”. “The In campaign needs to up its game; scaring people is not going to get them to vote,” he said.Labour’s internecine woes have been overshadowed in recent days by the split in the Tory party over Europe.However, Tuesday will see a potentially stormy meeting of Ken Livingstone, Hilary Benn, Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry to discuss the party’s “Britain in the World” review, which includes its approach to Syria and the Trident nuclear deterrent."
152;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-02-18T11:30:11Z;Strong dollar drags Puma full-year profits down 42%;Sports brand remains upbeat despite earnings slide as sales rise, helped by women’s sportswear;Puma, the German sports brand that sponsors Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, said that its net profit slumped 42 per cent last year due to the surge in the value of the US dollar.Puma, which is seeking to make up lost ground after losing market share to local rival Adidas and US sports giant Nike in recent years, posted net profit of €37.1m — or €2.48 per share — in 2015, down from €64.1m the year before. Analysts had expected €39.4m, according to a Reuters poll.However, the sports group, which has signed up the singer Rihanna as its creative director in an effort to boost its profile in the fast-growing women’s sportswear market, said on Thursday that sales had risen 14 per cent to €3.4bn in 2015.Stripping out currency fluctuations, Puma posted its fastest growth in the Americas, where sales were up 8.8 per cent. In Asia and the Pacific region, they were up 7.6 per cent, while in Europe they climbed 3.6 per cent.Bjørn Gulden, who has been working to turn Puma’s fortunes around since becoming chief executive in 2013, said that the group knew “we still have a lot to improve”.He added that the company had bolstered its brand and products in 2015, as well as reinforcing co-operation with its retail partners.“Unfortunately the strengthening of the US dollar versus nearly all other currencies has had a significant impact on both our gross profit margin and our operating expenses, and therefore also on our operating profits and net earnings,” he said.Despite the currency impact — Puma sources a lot of its products in Asia via contracts denominated in US dollars, but has significant revenues in euros — Mr Gulden struck an upbeat note on the group’s prospects.The Norwegian executive said that the group had “laid the groundwork” for “high single-digit sales growth as well as improved operating and net earnings in 2016”.This year will feature both the Olympic Games in Brazil — where Usain Bolt will be attempting an unprecedented third sweep of the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay — as well as the European football championships in France.Puma plans to boost its marketing efforts around both events, which, in combination with higher IT spending, means that its operating expenditure is likely to rise “in a mid to high single-digit range”.The group said, however, that the management would “place a strong emphasis on strict control of other operating costs”. As a result it expected its operating profit — which stood at €96.3m in 2015 — to be between €115m and €125m in 2016.Shares in Puma, which is majority owned by the French luxury conglomerate, Kering, were down 2.1 per cent at €180.30.
153;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-02-18T10:08:49Z;Nike drops commercial deal with boxer Manny Pacquiao;US sportswear company condemns Philippine title fighter for saying gay people ‘worse than animals’;Nike has ended its contract with millionaire boxer Manny Pacquiao, whose homophobic comments have triggered a wave of criticism from the gay community in the Philippines.Mr Pacquiao, who is running for a seat in the Philippines’ senate in this May’s election, described same-sex couples as “worse than animals” during a televised interview earlier this week.“We find Manny Pacquiao’s comments abhorrent,” Nike said in a statement, explaining that the company has ended its partnership with the boxer.Mr Pacquiao is a national hero in the Philippines, having won 10 world titles over eight weight classes, and has been in the international spotlight since last year’s titanic fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr, which smashed all records for sponsorship, box-office sales and pay-per-view fees.Local activists say the devout Christian plays an important role in shaping both public opinion and the overseas image of the world’s fifth largest Catholic country.“He has an outsized platform that he is provided by these sponsors,” said Aries Dela Cruz, the activist who created an online petition demanding Nike pull Mr Pacquiao’s sponsorship deal.“Because the Philippines is an English-speaking country with an English media, when you do hear about these anti-gay comments it does make it out into the English-speaking world.”Attitudes to same-sex relationships are complicated by the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.Though homosexuality is not criminalised, the latest report from the UN and USAID on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in the Philippines says LGBT people face discrimination at work and stereotyping in the mass media.Mr Pacquiao, who is worth an estimated $160m according to Forbes, has since posted a video of himself apologising for the comments on several social media accounts.“I still stand by my belief that I’m against same-sex marriage because of what the Bible says, but I’m not condemning LGBT,” he said on his official Instagram account, which is otherwise filled with photographs of his children and his training regime.Mr Pacquiao is a member of the Philippine House of Representatives.Despite a wave of criticism over Mr Pacquiao’s comments on social media, Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila, describes large parts of the local population as “homophobic” and says the well-connected sportsman is still a strong candidate in the upcoming election.“If we’re talking of the LGBT community vote by itself, I don’t think its enough to impact on his candidacy,” Mr Casiple said. “He has this political machinery, identifying himself with several presidential candidates, and then his own money and his own popularity.”The boxer’s comments add to a series of recent events that have raised concerns around rising intolerance across Southeast Asia.In Muslim-majority Indonesia last week, the government demanded Japanese messaging service Line to take down emoticons depicting same-sex couples and government officials have ordered that HIV outreach events for gay and bisexual men on university campuses be withdrawn.Additional reporting by Felipe Salvosa in Manila
154;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-02-08T18:18:39Z;China’s Anta challenges Nike for sports glory;Arrival of international football stars in China Super League is a boon for local sportswear maker;China has been on a buying spree of late, and not just for Swiss agribusiness giant Syngenta. ChemChina’s acquisition has been forced to share the headlines with a remarkable shopping binge by China’s top football clubs, with interesting implications for the country’s sports apparel manufacturers.Teams in the China Super League (CSL) have spent nearly $300m on transfers during the current window, according to transfer tracking site Transfermarkt, including Jiangsu Suning’s big-money purchases of Brazilians Alex Teixeira and Ramires. The total bill exceeds that of England’s Premier League during its January window.Big money has been flowing through Chinese professional football for years — not all of it legal — but the imprimatur of Xi Jinping has breathed new life into the Chinese game. This originates in an October 2014 decision by the State Council to expand the Chinese sports industry from Rmb400bn ($62.6bn) in 2014 to Rmb5tn in 2025. But the Chinese president also loves the game, hence a top-down policy that includes boosting the total number of elementary and middle schools that include football in their curriculum from roughly 5,000 at present to 20,000 by 2020 and 50,000 by 2025.This policy, part of a broader push to boost the domestic sports industry, has clearly benefited international stars such as Alex Teixeira and Ramires, but global sportswear giants are also likely to cash in: China has been a boon for companies like Nike, which has defied widespread angst about the Chinese consumer slowdown with strong sales and profits in the country. In 2009, the Oregon-based company signed a $2bn, exclusive 10-year deal to provide equipment to the CSL. Its decision may be validated by signs that high-quality players — rather than just those on the cusp of retirement — are now willing to play in the Chinese league.But smaller domestic brands are also set to benefit. Fujian province-based Anta may not have a seat at the sponsorship top table but it is positioning itself to benefit from a groundswell of football-related activity in lower-tier cities.In a proprietary brand survey conducted by FT Confidential Research, a research service from the Financial Times, Anta was China’s third most popular sportswear provider, and scored particularly well among lower-income households. In third-tier cities, 11.3 per cent of respondents named Anta as one of the two sportswear brands they most frequently buy, on par with global giant Adidas. Among respondents with annual household income of under Rmb100,000, Anta was chosen by 11.4 per cent, more than chose the German brand.This popularity pattern could be a boon: Anta is catering to the estimated 520m people living in China’s smaller cities. The selection of football boots sold online by Anta top out at Rmb239 a pair — Nike’s cheapest pair starts at Rmb279.Anta’s football strategy is focused on the grass roots. It is investing in marketing and tie-ups with provincial governments and local football coaching programmes. In Jiangsu, the eastern province where the Brazilians now play, Anta has formed a strategic partnership with the provincial government sports administration to establish the Jiangsu Youth Soccer League, which is expected to hold 200,000 matches involving 1,000 elementary schools, as well as training camps and tournaments.Nike and the big brands may have a lock on the commanding heights of international football, but there is still plenty of room for smaller players, such as Anta, in the lower leagues of the Chinese game. Investors recognise this: Anta shares are up 68 per cent over the past two years against a more than 40 per cent drop in those of domestic competitor Li Ning and an 11 per cent drop in the Hang Seng. Anta shares have also outperformed Nike’s by more than 10 percentage points over that period.David Wilder is Principal, China at FT Confidential Research.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd

Meanwhile, in the US, many high-profile companies, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Nike, sustained losses of more than 1 per cent in pre-market trading.Investors took cover in haven assets, such as US and German government bonds. The yields on Germany’s two-year bonds slid to a fresh record low, meanwhile the yield on the US 10-year note slipped. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.Gold also shined, climbing 0.23 per cent to $1,176.11 a troy ounce.On the other side of the spectrum, oil prices skidded into the red. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell 2.6 per cent to $30.10, while international marker Brent fell 1.8 per cent to $33.44.The US economic calendar is light this week. Testimony from Janet Yellen before Congress that begins on Wednesday is expected to take the spotlight, with traders seeking guidance on how the Federal Reserve chief is interpreting the recent slowdown in the American economy and a tightening of financial conditions.
156;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-01-22T16:19:51Z;Kasper Rorsted brings intellectual curiosity to Adidas;Dane revived Henkel during 8 years as chief executive;"As end-of-term reports go, Kasper Rorsted’s is not too bad. When the news broke on Monday that the 53-year-old Dane was leaving Henkel to become the new boss at Adidas, Henkel lost €1bn of its market value. Adidas gained a similar amount.It is not hard to see why. During his eight years as chief executive, Mr Rorsted has revivified Henkel, pushing up revenues, driving further into emerging markets and improving margins. Under his stewardship, the German consumer goods group’s market capitalisation quadrupled to more than €36bn.Investors in Adidas — which has lost ground against its arch-rival Nike in the battle for domination of the global sportswear market — are hoping that Mr Rorsted can pull off the same trick again.“He’s an optimizer, which is just what they need,” says one investor. “And he’s a doer. He’s not someone who spends ages sitting around strategising.”On the face of it, the multilingual Mr Rorsted and the world’s second largest sportswear company are a good match. The dynamic manager — who played handball for Denmark’s national youth team — is a keen athlete, who skis frequently in winter, and starts each day with an hour of running or in the gym.He is also a passionate fan of Bayern Munich, Germany’s most successful football team, which just happens to be sponsored — and part-owned — by his future employer.Another bonus is that moving from Henkel’s home in Düsseldorf to Bavaria — Adidas is headquartered in Herzogenaurach — will bring Mr Rorsted closer to the family home in Munich, where his wife and the younger two of his four children are based.Picking a chief executive from a different industry is not without risks, as many companies have found to their cost. But Mr Rorsted has managed to switch sectors before.After studying in Copenhagen and at Harvard Business School, he spend his early career in technology. He did stints at Oracle and Compaq and became Hewlett-Packard’s managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, before being let go by then chief executive Carly Fiorina.The episode was a rare blip in a largely seamless rise. Within a month of leaving HP, Mr Rorsted had 11 job offers from tech companies — and one from Henkel. He took the latter’s offer, because he could see a clear path to the top job, and set about getting to know his new company.His grand tours of Henkel’s businesses around the world as he sought to understand the industry became the stuff of company legend. On one trip he spent five weeks on the road in China; on another, six weeks in the US.People who know him say the son of a university professor has huge intellectual curiosity. “At business reviews he’s like a machine,” says one colleague. “He just fires off question after question after question.”Insiders at Henkel suspect that this intellectual restlessness may have spurred him to join Adidas. Outsiders see it as a natural move after eight years in charge, especially after Henkel’s interest in Procter & Gamble’s haircare business was trumped last summer by Coty’s bid for P&G’s beauty assets.Five days on from the announcement of Mr Rorsted’s move, Henkel’s shares have largely recovered their lost ground. Adidas’s investors will be hoping that Mr Rorsted’s boost in their company’s shares is more enduring."
157;NKE;Nike Inc;2016-01-20T15:23:12Z;Bono surveys a Red decade of ‘conscious consumerism’;U2 singer and other prominent figures assess the ‘cause marketing’ push against HIV/Aids;"An appearance by Bono at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside world leaders, chief executives and other members of the global elite, has become as common as snow in the mountain resort in recent years. But this week, when the U2 frontman arrives in Switzerland, he will be marking a special anniversary.It is a decade since the star went to the WEF to launch Red, the brand campaign that began with the aim of ending the transmission of HIV/Aids from pregnant women to their unborn children. Described by Bill Gates as an example of “creative capitalism”, Red’s early partners included Starbucks, Apple and Nike, which made products under the Red brand and donated proceeds to the fight against Aids in Africa. The campaign has over the past 10 years raised more than $350m.“Corporate social responsibility is a phrase that is in common usage now but it wasn’t back then,” Bono says, speaking to the Financial Times on the telephone from “bubblin’ Dublin”, the day before flying to Davos. An aim of Red, which he dreamt up with Bobby Shriver, a US lawyer and nephew of John F Kennedy, was to engage companies, and their customers and employees, in the fight against Aids, encouraging them to make and market Red-branded products, rather than just write a cheque.“Red understood early on that corporate social responsibility was not just for how companies gave their money but also for how companies make money.”Now, the challenge facing Bono and Red is the next decade. New partners have signed up, notably Bank of America, which in 2014 pledged $10m to Red, donating $1 for every free copy of the U2 track “Invisible” downloaded the day of that year’s Super Bowl. The bank recently pledged another $10m and has embarked on initiatives that include displaying at its ATMs images shot by the photographer Rankin of HIV-positive mothers and their children, who were born HIV-free thanks to their mothers taking antiretroviral medication.“If we can get these drugs consistently into the hands of these mothers they will not transmit [the disease] to their children and we can cut off its growth,” says Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive.Bono says the money Red has generated is “critical to the people whose lives it is saving”. As important, he says, “is the heat, the excitement”, the campaign has generated in terms of enlightening people who may never have thought twice about the Aids epidemic. “You can go to a Bank of America ATM now in Toledo, Ohio, and see a picture of children born without Aids because of Red. That has an effect.”He realised early on that it would be impossible to gain political backing for his plans if the scale of the Aids problem could not be brought home to people who might be unaware of it. “I remember sitting in the office of [then Senate majority leader] Bill Frist and him saying, ‘I want to grapple with this but when I’m at a pig roast I’m not hearing about it from my constituents.’” He laughs. “He meant that we have to be where people are.”Money raised from the sale of Red products is administered by The Global Fund, a non-profit partnership dedicated to the eradication of HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. The fund, which disperses $4bn a year, mainly provided by international governments, says Red has been the largest donor from the private sector. “It’s not just about the money. It’s about engaging the companies that are partners and the people who work for those companies to learn about HIV and the opportunity to end the epidemic,” says Mark Dybul, executive director of The Global Fund. “When a CEO talks to an African head of state about HIV it has a huge impact — much more than a global health person.”Aids has killed about 39m people and mothers who are HIV-positive continue to pass the virus to their unborn children. But the number of transmissions is in decline, according to Mr Dybul, thanks to greater availability of antiretroviral medication.“There were 700,000 people on the medication when we started Red; now we’re at 15m,” says Bono. Mr Dybul says an end to the epidemic is in sight. “The big issue right now is keeping people engaged. If we build on what we’ve done over the last 15 years we can control this epidemic …until we get a vaccine. Which we will do.”Red is not the only example of “creative capitalism” to hit the market in recent years. The Procter & Gamble-owed Pampers nappy brand, for instance, launched the One Pack = One Vaccine campaign in 2006 to combat tetanus in mothers and babies in African and Asian countries. With support from stars such as Oprah Winfrey, the campaign raised funds for an estimated 300m vaccines.The late Steve Jobs was involved with Red, designing and selling a Red-branded iPod. Apple has maintained its connection since Jobs’ death in 2011. Two years ago, Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, and his colleague Marc Newson, ran an auction of specially designed products, including a Leica Digital Rangefinder camera the pair customised, which sold for $1.8m. The auction raised $13m for Red, matched by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.I watch my daughters: they think about where they spend and about values. You have political power in your spending powerDoes Sir Jonathan think Red affected how companies think of corporate social responsibility? He demurs. “I’m much more interested in how a mother feels whose daughter is still alive than whether Red has had an impact on other companies.”He adds: “The thing that first struck me was that the magnitude and ugliness of the problem would normally be cause for people to turn away. I loved the way Bono saw it as a problem to be solved.”Christy Turlington Burns, the US supermodel, was an early supporter of Red, appearing in a Red Gap commercial, and has since started her own non-profit group — Every Mother Counts — which aims to end preventable deaths at childbirth. Red, she says, was a good guide for her own group to “see how partnerships can be established to extend your reach in a powerful way”.Bono says he has to fight to keep Aids in the headlines. “When we started out [with Red] the world Aids crisis was the news. After a couple of years the financial crisis became the news.” Red now has to “think differently”, he adds.The Red blend of celebrity glitter, corporate muscle and products that range from Red Le Creuset pots to Gap T-shirts has been called many things, including cause marketing and conscious consumerism.“Does conscious consumerism really exist?” he asks. “I think it does. I watch my daughters — they think about where they spend their money and they think about values. The consumer is changing …you have political power in your spending power.”"
158;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
159;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Lululemon: resetting the pace;An admirable turnround at the yoga pants maker;A yoga class is just the thing for the rattled psyches of the world’s money managers. Lululemon announced strong holiday sales this week and boosted targets for the next quarter. Its shares jumped 4 per cent on an otherwise ugly day. Fitness fanaticism — or at least weekend warriors’ need to dress the part — is also helping results at Nike (up 26 per cent in the past year) and Under Armour (7 per cent).Apart from the spandex peddlers, US retail is mostly grim. But Lululemon is not just benefiting from a trend. It has performed a rare feat in managing to reset the expectations of bruised investors, and then hit them.Lululemon said fourth-quarter revenue would come in slighter higher than its previous forecast. It also said profit margins would remain strong, a crucial point. Disappointing sales can cascade into bloated inventory that ties up cash and forces discounting to pull customers into shops and empty the storerooms.While the results are encouraging, the company is not nearly as fit as it was before the see-through pants crisis of 2013. Like-for-like sales, even after the rebound, are forecast to be in the high single-digits, half what they were. Its operating margin goal of 20 per cent is well below the 25 per cent achieved in 2013. The clearest indication of its shrunken ambitions is its share, off a third from its peak.Still, arresting a decline and starting a turnround are achievements not to be mocked in retail. Many consumer brands flounder, lose their appeal and are never heard from again. Another, more modest example of a revival of this is the low-end department store chain JC Penney, once on the verge of bankruptcy, which also reported a solid holiday season. For the current crop of adrift merchants — most prominently JC Penney’s slightly more upscale rival Macy’s — there is reason to be hopeful, if they can offer products customers want and manage investors’ expectations carefully.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

That’s up from earlier guidance of $670m to $685m. It also eclipsed Wall Street forecasts of $679.3m.Lululemon also raised its profit forecast to between 78 to 80 cents a share, topping analysts’ forecasts for 77 cents a share. Laurent Potdevin, chief executive, said:We had a very successful holiday season driven by strong execution in stores
and online during the key holiday weeks. Sales for the fourth quarter are
exceeding expectations and gross margin rates and expenses remain in line with
prior guidance.Lululemon has staged some recovery from a 2013 recall of its signature yoga pants that were too sheer. The retailer, along with companies like Nike and Under Armour, has benefited from the athleisure trend in which people increasingly wear sports gear outside the gym.Lululemon shares declined 6 per cent last year."

Its shares jumped 2.9 per cent on Wednesday, extending their year-to-date gain to 41 per cent. That compares with a roughly 1 per cent dip for the S&P 500 this year.Elsewhere, US crude oil prices rallied 2.2 per cent to $36.92 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.9 per cent to $36.77. A reading on crude inventories from the US Energy Department is due out later in the day. It’s expected to show US crude stocks increased by 1.4m barrels last week on the heels of a 4.8m barrel build the week prior.On the economic front, data from the US Commerce Department showed consumer spending ticked up by 0.3 per cent on a month-over-month basis in November, while personal income rose by the same margin. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity, and is particularly important during the holiday-shopping season, which kicked off last month.In currencies, the US dollar climbed by 0.21 per cent against a basket of six global currencies. The euro slumped by 0.4 per cent against the greenback.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note climbed 0.3 percentage point to 2.27 per cent.

Like smaller rivals such as Under Armour, Nike’s domestic performance is benefitting from consumers’ increasing habit of wearing sports fashions outside the gym.Analysts at Jefferies said of Nike’s quarterly results that it:Again delivered ahead of expectations, the results of which speak to the brand’s power and market positioning even amidst a challenging environment.Nike said that orders for the next four months were up 20 per cent, signalling its robust run will continue.

Sales were also up, climbing 4 per cent to $7.7bn, but missing Wall Street’s forecasts of $7.8bn. Earnings per share came in at 90 cents, topping Street views by four cents.A firmer dollar has been a drag for Nike, as it has for many US multi-nationals. In fact, excluding currency swings, revenues would have jumped 12 per cent. A stronger greenback makes US goods more expensive abroad, and also hits foreign sales figures when they are translated back into dollars.Nike is the best performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, with its shares rallying more than 35 per cent.The company has earned accolades from Wall Street for posting solid profit growth even as the world economy has sputtered. Indeed, the company that’s famous for its sneakers and endorsement deals with celebrities has posted earnings growth for seven-straight quarters, according to Bloomberg data. In comparison, S&P 500 earnings stagnated in the calendar third quarter.Nike’s shares jumped more than 3 per cent on the back of its quarterly results on Tuesday.Digging into the results, the company’s namesake Nike brand logged a 5 per cent year-over-year increase in sales, while the much smaller Converse unit posted an 8 per cent drop.Excluding the impact of currency changes, sales rose across every region, with greater China leading the way on a growth perspective, with a 28 per cent rise.

Financial Times, December 7LeBron James? Who’s he? Should I care about him?James is a 30-year-old basketball superstar who has signed a lifetime deal with Nike — a first for the sporting industry that marks a change in the nature of sponsorship deals.James, a forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers, came to prominence in 2003, having joined the professional league straight out of high school. He has two National Basketball Association championships under his belt from his time with the Miami Heat, which he left to return to the Cavaliers in 2014.So what does he mean to Nike, and Nike mean to him?He signed his first multimillion-dollar deal with Nike, worth $93m, straight out of high school in 2003 — and he’s been sponsored by the sportswear company ever since. Other prominent players sponsored by Nike include Kobe Bryant of Los Angeles Lakers and Kevin Durant of Oklahoma City Thunder.He‘s already earned a packet! How much is the new deal is worth?The deal is private but sports journalists have speculated that the sum could be more than $500m. James’s two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers is already reportedly worth $47m. Endorsements are an important source of additional revenue for NBA players because there are complicated rules governing how much they can earn directly from their teams.So that’s what’s in it for him? And more to the point why is Nike committing to a lifetime deal for someone in the twilight of their career?James is more than just a player. Many consider him a business brand, and the lifetime endorsement as the equivalent of a merger between the Nike and LeBron James corporations. He boasts more than 25.7m Twitter followers; Durant, his nearest rival in terms of popularity, boasts a mere 12.5m. To Nike, that’s a lot of potential sneaker dollars. According to SportScanInfo, as quoted by Forbes, Nike sold $340m of James signature shoes in the last year, twice as much as Durant.These shoes sound special. Should I be buying some?Join the queue. Fans rush to buy player-endorsed shoes and apparel because of the celebrities’ direct input into their designs. In the latest Christmas line, for example, James is said to have gone for a frosty feel inspired by “fierce Midwest winters”; his home town is Akron, Ohio. Nike boasts on its website that the shoes, the LeBron 13, are pearlescent blue and feature hyperposite technology (whatever that may be) and a shattered ice-inspired “13” on the heel. Shoes such as these usually sell for sky-high prices. You’d have to part with $200 for a pair.Wow, it sounds like sport today isn’t about watching the players but shifting clothes.It seems to be. Which is why representing up-and-coming sports stars in cutting endorsement deals is its own very lucrative business. This was brought to light by the film, Jerry Maguire, in which Tom Cruise’s character is coaxed into shouting “Show me the money!” by his client, a rising National Football League player.I remember the Tiger Woods affair. What if James somehow falls from grace?The terms of the deal are not publicly available, but it would be hard to imagine that Nike hasn’t accounted for risk factors such as death, injury or reputational damage, or taken out insurance to mitigate such things.This sounds like he’s set up for life.The lifetime figure is certainly reminiscent of the celebrity bond phenomenon, which has allowed famous entities to cash in on the power of their brand with upfront payments.Wow. I’d love to be paid now for work I’ve still to do.James is far from being the first so sign up to commercial debt securities. The most famous example is probably Bowie bonds — asset-backed securities backed by the current and future revenues of 25 albums by David Bowie. They were pioneered by rock ’n’ roll investment banker David Pullman. Bowie bonds were bought for $55m and allowed the artist to benefit from the payment upfront.What will LeBron James be doing when he retires from the basketball court?James is already active in the media and film production. He co-starred with comedian Amy Schumer in Trainwreck, nominated in this year’s Golden Globes. He is also developing his own platform to host media content produced by pro-athletes and he is pursuing more film and television projects with Warner Bros Entertainment. So there’s certainly potential for some LeBron celebrity bonds yet.izabella.kaminska@ft.com"
169;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Nike signs LeBron James to lifetime deal;Shares rise on prospects for what could be largest single athlete guarantee in history;In what is likely a lucrative win, LeBron James signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike.Nike, the sporting goods maker, said it had “built a strong LeBron business over the past 12 years” and saw “potential for this to continue and grow throughout his playing career.”The company did not comment on how much the contract was worth, but sports news group ESPN reported, citing a source, that it could be the largest single athlete guarantee in company history.Mr James, the Cleveland Cavaliers forward, signed a two-year contract with the team earlier this year that is reportedly worth $47m.Nike endorses a host of big-name athletes with the hopes that their fame will rub off on its brands.Michael Jordan is estimated to make $100m a year from the Air Jordan brand of shoes and athletic clothing designed, owned and produced by Nike’s Jordan Brand subsidiary.Shares in the sporting goods group rose about 1 per cent in after-hours trading, after closing down the day about 0.53 per cent.
170;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-11-26T19:17:11Z;Lord Coe steps down from Nike role to calm ‘noise’;Athletics leader accused of lobbying after US company’s home town wins championships role;Sebastian Coe has severed his ties with Nike after allegations he lobbied for the US company’s home town to be awarded the 2021 Athletics World Championships.The president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, elected to that post in August, denied his £100,000-a-year ambassadorial role with Nike was a conflict of interest.“But it is clear that perception and reality have become horribly mangled,” he said. “I have stepped down from my ambassadorial role with Nike, which dates back 38 years. The current noise level is not good for the IAAF and not good for Nike.”This week, the BBC disclosed an email sent in January by Craig Masback, a director of business affairs for Nike’s global sports marketing division, to two executives at Track Town USA, which promotes running in Eugene, Oregon, and is funded by Nike.The email said Mr Masback had discussed the bid with Lord Coe, who had told him he had discussed it with Lamine Diack, then the IAAF president. Subsequently, the championships were awarded to Eugene without a bidding process.The IAAF is struggling to restore confidence in world athletics after the suspension of Russia from all athletics competitions because of its mass-doping offences.Lord Coe said the ethics commission of the IAAF had cleared him to continue his commercial activities but he had decided they had become a distraction.He added that his company, CSM, would not tender for any work connected to athletics and he would step down as the head of the British Olympic Association after the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.“I made a judgment that the issues I have been dealing with in the last few weeks, the reform of the organisation and the challenges across two or three fronts need an unflinching focus and the ‘noises off’ are a distraction,” he said.“This has been a long and historic relationship. It was one I maintained through the London Olympic years, when Adidas were a partner and when I was the chairman of the British Olympic Association. It reflects my intention to focus as long and hard as I can on steadying the ship, which has been rocking rather badly recently.”Lord Coe spoke after a meeting of the IAAF council in Monaco. During the meeting, Russia agreed to accept an indefinite ban from athletics and to co-operate with inspectors in the hope of being reinstated to competition before the Rio Olympics.“One of the prevailing sentiments around the council table is that there is not a single person in the room that underestimates the challenges in assessing the failures and rebuilding trust in our sport,” said Lord Coe.He added that if any of the investigations into corruption at the IAAF showed that the bid for a World Championship was improper, “action will be taken”.Paula Radcliffe, the British long-distance runner, was one of six athletes appointed to the IAAF’s athletes commission.

This topped Wall Street expectations for earnings of 73 cents a share, but was down 46 per cent from a year ago.However, weakness in the construction equipment market and the global agricultural sector pushed equipment sales 26 per cent lower to $5.9bn, shy of analysts’ estimates for $6.1bn. Total revenue declined 25 per cent to $6.7bn.Bumper harvests have weighed on grain prices and the Department of Agricultural said this week that US net farm income was forecast to decline 38 per cent in 2015. That in turn has hurt demand for agricultural equipment.Deere warned that global sales of agriculture and turf equipment, its largest division, were forecast to decrease by about 8 per cent in fiscal 2016.Construction and forestry equipment sales, its second-largest division, are expected to declined 5 per cent in 2016.The outlook also reflects the sting from currency translation as many of Deere’s key international markets have seen their currencies weakened, while the US dollar has strengthened.For the year, the company projects earnings of $1.4bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.“[The] stock could trade up on short covering due to solid cost control, but guidance for 2016 suggests end market and earnings declines are continuing,” said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies.Deere shares, which have declined nearly 10 per cent this year, climbed 4.8 per cent to $80.Shares in Hormel Foods gained 3.1 per cent to $73.55, after the maker of Spam, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O turkeys said its board had authorised a two-for-one stock split. The news arrived a day after the Minnesota-based company forecast stronger than expected 2016 earnings.Hormel is the latest company electing to split its shares, a decision that often bolsters investor interest in buying shares due to the reduction in price. Earlier this year Nike, Kroger and Netflix, announced their own stock splits.HP Inc was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 falling 13.6 per cent to $12.65, after the maker of PCs and printers issued disappointing first-quarter guidance.Hewlett-Packard separated into two companies in October. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the IT operations company, also issued disappointing earnings outlook, but shares climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.12.Guess shares jumped more than 6.8 per cent to $20.86, after the retailer reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations.The Los Angeles-based company said profits slid 40 per cent to $12.4m, or 15 cents a share, however this was better than the 11 cents that analysts had forecast. Sales slid nearly 12 per cent to $521m.Guess lifted the lower end of its earnings outlook and now sees full-year earnings in the range of 93 cents to $1.02 a share, compared with estimates for 96 cents.US stocks inched higher and healthcare stocks led the benchmark S&P 500, rising 0.5 per cent.At close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly unchanged at 2,088.87 and 17,813.39 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 5,116.14. US markets will be closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving Day.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
172;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Nike continues to win in China;Analysis of company’s strategy offers no hint of a slowdown for market leader;US sportswear-maker Nike maintains a leading position in China. It is growing faster than all other sportswear companies in the country, and continues to defy the wider economic slowdown.In its fiscal 1Q16 (ended August 31 2015), its Greater China revenue rose 30 per cent year-on-year to $886m, contributing 11 per cent of its total revenue, up from 9 per cent in 1Q14. It recorded strong growth across each of its key categories, most notably sportswear, running and basketball. In addition, advanced orders in Greater China rose 22 per cent year-on-year in 1Q16, highlighting strong consumer demand for the next few quarters.It remains the market leader in China by sales, and it is the most popular sportswear brand in our Consumer Brands Survey, with 21.2 per cent of respondents saying Nike is one of the two brands they most frequently buy.Popularity among women highlights advantage in customer experienceThe company has benefited strongly from its ability to cater to the emerging female sportswear consumer in China.Our survey found that 23.3 per cent of female respondents most regularly buy Nike sportswear, higher than the 19.2 per cent recorded for men. This reflects, in part, its success in promoting a female-specific sports training app – Nike+ Training Club. It also set up a women’s product experience centre in Shanghai in November 2014, and offers various services to help consumers analyse their running patterns and training courses. Female sportswear consumers in China seem to place greater value on consumer experience than males.Adidas also opened a women’s experience store in Shanghai in June and launched a series of marketing campaigns targeting female consumers. But compared with Nike, its popularity among female respondents is relatively low, selected by 16.7 per cent of female respondents. Adidas has focused more on marketing campaigns featuring celebrities wearing their products, reflecting its wider exposure to the fashion and casualwear segments.Professional sport sponsorships positions brand at high-endNike has pursued an aggressive elite-sport sponsorship strategy in China. And we think this will help reinforce its premium appeal over the long run, supported by the ongoing push by authorities to strengthen professional sports leagues, particularly in football.Nike sponsors China’s Super League in football, paying $2bn to become the league’s official equipment sponsor for ten years starting in 2009. Nike also became the sponsor of China’s national football team – across multiple age groups and for both genders – in late 2014, ending the team’s 30-year-long partnership with Adidas. The deal will run for 10-12 years.It also sponsors other popular sports teams, such as China’s national tennis team and basketball team, and has sponsored the Shanghai marathon for four consecutive years.Good marketing, sales outperformance and positive customer experiences, in conjunction with a sponsorship strategy that reinforces its premium credentials, all suggest that Nike will continue to run rings around its sportswear competition in China.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

Its current $8bn repurchase programme is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.The Oregon-based company boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 14 per cent to $0.32 a share on a pre-split basis to be payable in January.“We think this latest move reflects an ongoing commitment to delivering healthy shareholder returns based on strong sales trends and increasing cash piles,” said Edward Plank, an analyst at Jefferies.Following in the footsteps of Netflix and Kroger, which announced stock splits earlier this year, Nike’s board also approved a two-for-one stock split of its shares. Shares will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24.The split will reduce the consumer discretionary sector’s weight in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 18.3 per cent at present to about 16.7 per cent, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.Nike shares have advanced 38 per cent so far this year as the athletic apparel maker has benefited from the so-called athleisure trend in which people increasingly wear athletic apparel outside the gym. By comparison, the Dow is nearly unchanged over the same period.Shares in Ross Stores jumped 10 per cent to $50.84 after the retailer reported better than expected earnings in the three months ended in October.The California-based company said profits jumped 12 per cent to $215.7m or 53 cents a share, in the three months ended in October, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for earnings of 50 cents a share. Sales rose 7 per cent to $2.8bn in line with estimates.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, gained 3 per cent, ahead of expectations for a 2.3 per cent rise.Foot Locker shares rose 5.7 per cent to $65.01 after the shoe retailer said third-quarter profits topped Wall Street forecasts.The New York-based retailer said profits fell 33 per cent to $80m, or 57 cents a share. Adjusting for one-time items, however, the company reported earnings of $1 a share, ahead of forecasts for 95 cents.Sales rose nearly 4 per cent to $1.8bn in line with forecasts. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch shares jumped 25.1 per cent to $24.38 after the teen retailer said its third-quarter profits more than doubled to $41.9m, or 60 cents a share, eclipsing analysts’ estimates.Sales fell for the 11th straight quarter but the pace of decline slowed for the second straight month.“Our third-quarter results exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter and provide the strongest validation yet that our initiatives are working,” said Arthur Martinez, executive chairman.The string of better than expected results offered some reprieve to retail stocks, which were under pressure last week after department store chains blamed the strong dollar and warm weather for disappointing results.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.2 per cent to lead the benchmark index.By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,089.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,823.81 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 5,104.92.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

175;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-10-19T20:08:20Z;Global companies sign White House pledge on climate change action;Obama spearheads drive to enlist corporate backers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;"Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Nike and Ikea are among dozens of global companies that have signed a White House-sponsored pledge to take more aggressive action on climate change, as part of a broad push by President Barack Obama to corral corporate support for a global climate deal this year in Paris.The White House on Monday announced that 68 companies had joined the 13 original signatories to the “American Business Act on Climate Pledge”. Mr Obama later hosted the chief executives of five companies — Johnson & Johnson, Intel, Hershey’s, California-based utility PG&E and Berkshire Hathaway Energy — and some of their suppliers for a discussion about how companies can cut carbon emissions around the world.Although the 81 companies included a handful of energy companies, large oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron were notably absent.Mr Obama hopes that support from companies with a combined market capitalisation of more than $5tn will boost the chances that the delegates from almost 200 countries can reach a climate accord in Paris. It comes as the president tries to craft a legacy on climate changeduring his final 15 months in office.The push to secure backing from corporate America comes as the issue of climate change remains politically divisive in the US. Republicans, including many of the GOP presidential contenders, are highly critical of the way Mr Obama is forging ahead on climate change.“It is . . . quite significant six weeks out from the Paris conference to have the president [meet] with these corporate leaders to underscore that the American private sector is squarely behind the outcome that we are trying to achieve,” a senior administration official told the Financial Times.Alex Gorsky, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, said having a large number of companies join the pledge would have a “very significant impact” on pushing for a deal. “We’re excited that it does seem to be picking up momentum,” Mr Gorsky told the FT. “The more large companies work together . . . it will create significant momentum around the world.”In making climate change one of his signature issues, Mr Obama has taken actions that have won praise from environmentalists to Pope Francis. But they have drawn scorn from Republicans who say his efforts are unconstitutional and risk hurting US economic competitiveness. The White House hopes that the industry support will act as a “very powerful voice” to help counter the view that cutting carbon emissions and economic growth is a zero-sum game.“One of the old and tired critiques . . . is that the only way to act is to do so by putting more businesses in your private sector at a competitive disadvantage,” said the US official. “The commitment by these companies and their voice in supporting an ambitious international agreement really puts that argument to rest.”The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problem

Further readingThe Obama administration says the 81 companies that have signed the pledge, which includes Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, McDonald’s, Sony and Starbucks, represent 30 per cent of the largest 50 companies in the US and employ 9m people in 50 states.“If you look at where these companies are headquartered, if you look at who their customers are and who their employees are, they represent America and they represent a broad cross section of America, including places where Republicans are representing them,” the US official added.In addition to signing the pledge to support a climate change deal in Paris, many of the companies announced commitments that included reducing carbon emissions by up to 50 per cent, cutting water usage by up to 80 per cent and guaranteeing that 100 per cent of their purchased energy came from renewables.Ikea committed to produce as much renewable energy as it consumed globally by 2020, while Johnson & Johnson vowed to cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 and to power all its facilities with renewable energy by the same year. Dell said it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2020, compared with 2012, and boost purchases of renewable energy to at least 50 per cent of the total by 2020. PG&E aims to provide its customers with electricity that is more than 60 per cent carbon free by 2020. Nike plans to use 100 per cent renewable energy in its owned or operated factories by 2025. Siemens pledged to reduce its global carbon footprint by 50 per cent by 2020 and cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2030.While some of the commitments had been previously made, the official said the bulk were either new or expanded on previous goals.The official said the White House hoped to engineer a third round of pledges before Paris. “We feel very good about not just the volume of companies but actually the cross section that they represent. Now the opportunity for us is to take these leaders in sectors across the economy and encourage them to bring their peers into this as well.”The pledge marks the latest example of corporations taking action on issues when they perceive that the mood of their consumers has shifted. This year, Indiana and Arkansas abandoned “religious freedom laws” that critics said would allow discrimination against gays following a wave of criticism from companies that included GE, Apple and Walmart.Mr Gorsky said climate change was another issue where companies were becoming quicker to follow their customers.“Just as the opinion of customers, and in our case patients, around the world are more sensitised to this issue . . . they are demanding more from the companies from which they purchase their products,” he said.Separately on Monday, the Carbon Pricing Panel, a group led by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that includes Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and François Hollande, the French president, called on countries and companies around the world to set a price for carbon.The EU is home to the world’s largest carbon trading system, but absent from Monday’s call for carbon pricing were the US and China. The two powers last year struck a landmark bilateral accord on action to curb climate change, but their experiences with carbon markets have been rocky.Last month China said it would start an already planned national carbon trading system in 2017, but its local pilot schemes have been plagued by interconnection difficulties and a lack of transparency.In the US, an effort to create a national cap-and-trade system backed by Mr Obama failed in Congress in 2010 in the face of opposition from Republicans. The president’s more recent plan to cut carbon emissions from the power sector encourages policymakers to set up or join simpler carbon trading systems at state level.@DimiSevastopulodemetri.sevastopulo@ft.com"
176;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-10-16T14:50:55Z;Coe to take the game to big sport;Former athlete plans to use knowledge of the field and war chest to build Chime unit;"Lord Coe, who led London’s 2012 Olympics bid, plans to use a war chest of “hundreds of millions” of pounds to build a sports agency to take on the industry’s leading companies on their own turf.The former athlete is executive chairman of CSM, the sports division of Chime Communications, which was sold in July to marketing rival WPP and US buyout firm Providence Equity Partners for £374m.In an interview with the Financial Times as Chime’s shares were delisted on Friday, he and chief executive Zak Brown said the new private equity owners had urged them to “think big” and build a sports business that can win ground in the US and Asia.CSM advises countries and cities, as well as brands, on how to host or be linked to big sporting events. It also provides marketing, advertising, broadcast and sponsorship services.Mr Brown said Providence had told the company it had “hundreds of millions; knocking on a billion” to build its sport business and make acquisitions.“We are already a big agency. We have 900 people. But we are going to be making ourselves more famous with more investments in North America and Asia,” he said. “We are 30 days away from a big US acquisition.”Specifically, Mr Brown said CSM would target golf, tennis and entertainment, areas that have traditionally been the preserve of IMG-WME, the industry’s largest sports agency.IMG was founded to look after the golfer Arnold Palmer and also represented Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. In tennis, it represents the likes of Novak Djokovic, the Wimbledon champion, and Maria Sharapova, the world’s highest-earning female athlete.But after a $2.4bn merger with Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavour, IMG’s competitors sense opportunities. “IMG is going through a lot of change and that can be a challenge, integrating these two big entities,” said Mr Brown.Lord Coe said this presented the chance “for a step change”.Chime Communications, the marketing services group founded in 1989 by Lord Bell, Margaret Thatcher’s media adviser, was long considered a prime takeover target.Read more“We are from sport and we will always look through that optic of people who have been involved in sport: we are competitive and want to win,” he said.The investment by Providence comes as other branches of the entertainment industry face uncertainty: film and television viewers are migrating online, with advertisers in pursuit.But sport continues to grow strongly: PwC estimates that total sport revenues around the world will rise by 3.7 per cent to $145bn in 2015, and major events continue to be irresistible to sponsors.Founded by Lord Bell, once Margaret Thatcher’s media adviser, in 1989, Chime has moved in the past decade to concentrate on sports. Its sports marketing division last year generated 43 per cent of the group’s £300m of revenues.Lord Coe pointed out that governments, especially in the Middle East, central Asia and the Far East, were increasingly interested in using sporting events to energise their populations and drive infrastructure improvements.“Sport is the biggest driver. Governments can move the dial more quickly through sport than anything else,” he said. “We are seeing this particularly in countries where economic progress is being made.“Southeast Asian economies, for example, are realising that quality of life is more than just about economic benefits. I have just been to India which is an extraordinary market: there are highly competitive states and provinces that all feel that sport is an important vehicle.”CSM advised Azerbaijan on securing this year’s European Games for Baku, its capital and largest city. The British Olympic Association, which Lord Coe chairs, voted for Baku to be awarded the competition.But Lord Coe said there was no conflict of interest between his involvement in the Olympic movement, or his non-executive presidency of the IAAF, the athletics federation, and his work for CSM or Nike, for which he is a paid ambassador.He said he would be fully transparent about his various interests. “You tell me anybody currently in international sport where every interest they have is recorded,” he said.Lord Coe said the desire of new countries, particularly from the Middle East, central Asia and the Far East, to host major events was “fantastically exciting”.“I have got bored of going to sport conventions and the tired old mantras of using sport to make an impact in exciting new territories and the first time they want to go somewhere new we say: ‘Oh, we are not sure about your politics and it is a bit hot in July’,” he said.“There is a paradigm shift going on. Sport shines a light on many issues that politicians would not want to go within 100 miles of. Would we have discussed, as I did some months ago with a minister in Qatar, the labour rights around our arenas for the World Athletics Championships? Would we have discussed gay rights in Russia if it had not been for Sochi [which held the Winter Olympics]?”"
177;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-09-25T20:25:44Z;Nike surges on rare China optimism;Sales of footwear in China and Taiwan surge 36 per cent in the three months to August;Nike shares surged to a fresh record as the US sportswear maker’s latest results showed that sales in China are humming.The stock surged 9 per cent to $125.02, putting it on track for its biggest one-day rise in a year.With investors having spent the summer ditching companies with exposure to China, Nike’s buoyant results in the country fanned new gains for a stock that had already been comfortably outperforming the wider US stock market this year.Sales of footwear in China and Taiwan surged 36 per cent in the three months to the end of August, while its clothing sales jumped 22 per cent.Analysts at Canaccord said of the performance that “surprisingly, the macro volatility in China does not appear to be affecting demand for the brand as the company’s efforts to reprofile its stores are yielding strong results”.Evidence Nike is successfully navigating a Chinese economy that is moving from annual expansion rates of closer to 5 per cent than the giddier 10 per cent is a fresh fillip for a company already benefiting from the so-called “athleisure” trend in the US, in which people are wearing more sportswear outside the gym.Nike also served up signs that the strong level of demand is holding up in the current quarter, with its future orders, excluding the effects of swings in the currency, rising 17 per cent.Analysts at Canaccord said that the gauge “offers good visibility into demand for the next few quarters”.Yesterday’s leap leaves Nike shares up 30 per cent this year compared with a 6 per cent decline for the broader S&P 500.With Nike now trading 28 times next year’s estimated earnings, analysts said that Nike shares may struggle to add to their stellar gains.US indices were mixed by the close of trading with the S&P 500 down 0.1 per cent to 1,931.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.7 per cent to 16,314.67 and the Nasdaq Composite 1 per cent weaker at 4,686.50.In sharp contrast to Nike’s fortunes in China, Caterpillar, the maker of outsized trucks and diggers used in the mining industry, is struggling there as the country’s ravenous demand for commodities eases.Caterpillar shares fell another 1.3 per cent to $64.98 on Friday, adding to Thursday’s 6.3 per cent decline after the Illinois-based company cut its revenue forecast.Elsewhere on the US stock market, shares of Pier 1, a home furnishing chain, were under heavy pressure after the retailer cut its profit forecast for the year.The stock fell as much as 21 per cent to $6.84 before closing 12 per cent weaker at $7.60. The retailer, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, insisted it will be in better shape for the critical holiday shopping season in the US, which begins with the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.Investors’ focus on retailers is likely to intensify in coming weeks with expectations that American consumers will begin to spend more of the windfall they’ve enjoyed from lower petrol prices.Those hopes were strengthened on Friday by the third and final revision to US gross domestic product for the second quarter, which showed a bounce in consumer spending to 3.6 per cent from 3.1 per cent, propelled the wider economy to its best quarterly showing in almost a year.The S&P 500 retailing index is already the best performing sector on the benchmark index this year with a 16 per cent rise.
178;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Sales growth: the zero hour;US companies revenues have stalled. Must share prices follow?;"Much is said about China, the Fed, and the price of oil. Also: Hillary Clinton, consumer confidence, unemployment, manufacturing surveys, rig counts, exchange rates, trade balances, horoscopes, tea leaves, resistance levels and auguries of every sort. Those who invest in stocks do well, however, to spare a little time for perhaps the most fundamental indicator of all: are companies selling more stuff to their customers?In the US, sales are not telling a good story. In the first quarter of this year, sales growth for S&P 500 companies — excluding financials — slipped below zero. In the second quarter the decline was three per cent. A year ago growth was solidly in the mid single-digits. Yes, some of this is down to commodity prices, but the drizzly weather extends to other sectors: consumer goods, autos, media, food. Resilience — healthcare, software — is rarer.This is not a crisis. Sales growth is volatile: it touched zero for the S&P 500 in 2012, and bounced. And US companies have proven adept at conjuring earnings growth out of limp sales. Analyst estimates suggest that in the fourth quarter we will see a resurgence (but remember that if Wall Street has a motto, it is “in two quarters we’ll see the inflection point”.)What is to be done in a low growth world? As growth has slowed, the market has declared its (perhaps temporary) preference: buy growth where it can be found. Over the past year, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has outpaced its Value cousin by 7 per cent — a very large gap by historical standards. This has made growth expensive. Nike, which reported strong results this week, has maintained growth in the range of 5 per cent; rare in a big company, these days. It trades at 30 times earnings, nearly double the S&P average. The big bet now is whether growth shares will remain ascendant or if companies which earn solid profits, despite sluggish sales, will come into style.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
179;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-09-18T16:45:50Z;McIlroy and Spieth lead golf’s young pretenders;New prodigies have kept interest among fans and advertisers alive;“How did you do that?” Rory McIlroy asked Tiger Woods, as the pair traded shots on the range. “You’ll learn,’’ replied Woods, fully embracing the role of wise elder.The setting was not a major championship or a PGA Tour event, but a Nike advertisement that aired after the sports­wear company had signed McIlroy to a multimillion-dollar contract in 2013. The subtext was clear enough: the mantle of “greatest golfer in the world” was being passed to a young pretender, and a new era had begun.At the launch announcement in Abu Dhabi, Nike’s then president Cindy Davis talked of McIlroy’s ability to “connect with fans everywhere”. The message appeared to be that, if golf had a new superstar, he’d still be wearing Nike’s famous Swoosh logo.Sport rarely fits the marketing industry’s need for certainty, however, and since then another player has emerged to challenge the Northern Irishman’s place at the top of the world rankings.On the same day as Nike’s Abu Dhabi launch, its sports brand rival Under Armour told the trade press it had signed the promising 19-year-old college player Jordan Spieth to wear its range of golf clothing, a business generating sales in the region of $100m a year at that point.Kevin Plank, Under Armour’s founder, admitted that McIlroy had been his first choice and that he tried to pull together a deal that would see him wearing his clothing as he played with the Titleist brand of clubs. At the start of this year, Under Armour cemented its relationship with Spieth with a 10-year deal that assures no other company logo appears on the player’s clothing until after the 2025 season.The logos of Spieth’s roster of other sponsors — AT&T, Rolex, Perfect Sense Digital, NetJets and SuperStroke Grips — are nowhere to be seen. For golf club maker Titleist, he wears a branded glove. This leaves plenty of room for the distinctive UA badge. As he walked the fairways of St Andrews at this year’s British Open, brand-aware TV viewers could have counted 16 Under Armour logos on the player’s wiry frame.The subtext below the frenzied marketing activity is of a sport desperate to promote itself to people of Spieth and McIlroy’s age. Participation numbers have fallen sharply among the so-called millennial generation of 20-somethings. The industry’s plan is clear, if a little simplistic. If golf can produce telegenic young stars, it will encourage younger viewers to take up the game.The two players have kept their side of the bargain. Spieth and McIlroy have won four of the last six major championships — the ultimate barometer of an elite golfer’s pedigree.When 39-year-old Zach Johnson won the Open Championship at St Andrews in July, it ended Spieth’s hopes of winning the Grand Slam of all four majors in a calendar year, having already won The Masters and the US Open. The disappointment in the coverage was palpable: Johnson’s win had spoilt the bigger story.Amid the excitement, the players at least are keeping a sense of historical perspective.McIlroy said before the US PGA Championship in August: “Everything happens so quickly that a year ago . . . it was the Rory Era — and then Jordan [Spieth] wins the Masters and it’s the Jordan Era. Eras last about six months these days, instead of 20 years”.It remains to be seen whether any of the current crop of stars will inherit the mantle of Tiger Woods, either as a player or a salesman. The 39-year-old’s relatively poor recent form belies a player who has won 14 major championships since his emergence in 1996.Just as McIlory and Spieth are tasked with reaching millennials, so Woods was heralded as golf’s Trojan horse into non-traditional golf markets.His first major win at The Masters in Augusta in 1997 was not only brilliant, it was also so “on-brand” for Nike — the black kid won the title at a place where his skin colour would have prevented him playing until 1975 and it was compulsory to have a black caddie until 1983.Woods’ Masters victory came just six years after the club admitted its first black member. Yet the USPGA’s figures on golf participation among ethnic minorities shows that Woods’ legacy in this area has been negligible.Ted Bishop, president of the PGA of America, says: “You really haven’t seen any increase in diversity participation since [Woods] came to the forefront, which is really disconcerting.”Such facts won’t deter the sports marketing industry from investing in heroes, of which there is a steady supply. Jason Day won the USPGA Championship, the final major of the year. Like McIlroy and Spieth he is telegenic, articulate and in his 20s.“For young guys such as me and Jordan and Rickie Fowler (26) and Hideki Matsuyama (23), a lot of those guys are starting to play better golf and starting to challenge,” says Day.“It’s going to be a lot of fun over the next five to 10 years.”A whole industry is hoping he is right.A plot of 200 golfers’ driving ability, using 2015 PGA tour data, shows Rory McIlroy’s strength off the tee.The Irishman gains a big advantage by being both straight and long with his first strike.Jason Day of Australia hits further if less accurately.Jordan Spieth’s drives lack length but the American’s forte comes later in his chipping and putting, as he gains his edge on and around the greens.All three share one key quality: their success is vital for golf marketing’s longer game.Source: PGATour.com — measuring average length in yards and accuracy off the tee

Lodge near a Chinese school and you may find yourself awoken before dawn by yells of “One, two!” as bleary-eyed youngsters are cajoled through their morning exercises. Universities feature weekly mandatory runs: students shuffle around sports tracks, attired in regular day wear from jeans to denim skirts.China wants to develop its sports industry, starting with its youth. Even if they do not all change into tracksuits and trainers to exercise, the sports apparel market will grow. Last year, retail sales of sportswear in the US reached $91bn, Euromonitor says. In China, they were around a quarter of that. The market researcher expects Chinese growth of nearly one-tenth per annum between 2014-2019, twice the rate forecast for the US.While the expanding pie should allow most participants to grow, some are likely to gain greater heft than others. In the year to May, Nike’s China sales rose to $3bn, up by nearly one-fifth and the fastest growth of any geography. Thus, according to Euromonitor, Nike leads the market with 14 per cent share; rival foreign brand Adidas has a similar portion.There is a local contender: Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports. The company has one-tenth of the market and has also been growing rapidly. In the first half, announced last month, the top line rose by a quarter.Anta has some advantages, including a strong presence in second- and third- tier cities, where retail growth is strongest, according to consultant Bain. It has also learned from the mistakes of former market darling Li Ning, which tried to take its brand up market, resulting in several poor years. Anta’s high-end foray is focused on its Fila brand, which has been doing well.But Anta’s biggest advantage is that it leads the mid-market segment. Attractive goods, then, for poor students. And for high spenders in an uncertain environment, when belt-tightening begins.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
181;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-08-26T22:16:57Z;China slowdown belies consumer market health;Nimble companies maintain profits as spending habits evolve;Growing evidence of China’s economic difficulties and the ensuing stock market rout have sent shockwaves around a financially troubled world that has been banking on China to stimulate demand.But while sales of luxury goods from Prada handbags to Rolls-Royce cars have slumped, some companies focused on ordinary consumers in China are finding ways to maintain their businesses, selling more washing machines and rice crackers as the economy slows.Analysts say the dramatic, negative headlines belie a vast, complex and increasingly competitive consumer market where companies have to fight harder to boost their sales, whether by offering cheaper, smaller package sizes at the lower end or improving their products and customer service.Retail sales have been growing at an annualised 10 per cent in recent months, according to official data, but analysts are sceptical about the government’s figures and believe that even in the best case they cover up wide divergences between companies.“Consumer demand has always been there in China and in the past it was easy for companies to grab it,” says Spencer Leung, a consumer industry analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. “But things have slowed down and only those who can offer differentiated goods can capture demand.”He says that multinational companies focused on the mass market in China have been particularly good at maintaining their performance as annual gross domestic product growth has dropped from more than 10 per cent in 2010 to 7 per cent in the second quarter this year.Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nike all reported expanding sales in China in their most recent updates, while Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, arrested the slide in his company’s shares on Monday after telling a US TV show host that he was seeing “strong growth” in China in July and August.Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai, says that while the stock market turbulence has worried some consumers, few are directly exposed given that only 6 per cent of households own equities.The slowing economy, dragged down by the underperforming industrial and property sectors, has undoubtedly hit consumer confidence but it has also changed the way people buy.“People are still spending but they are more careful about how they spend, with more focus on features and functions, after-sales support and how products fit in their life,” says Mr Cavender.Samsonite, the suitcase maker, saw its China sales suffer over the past couple of years but delivered an annualised 28 per cent jump in sales in the first half of this year after it shifted its focus away from luxury to more affordable products.“Most consumer companies see that consumers in China are becoming smarter, they want to buy goods with better value,” says Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s chief executive. “That trend was already starting over the last two years and will only continue.”Zhou Yunjie, chief executive of the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Haier, China’s largest distributor of home appliances, says the company has mitigated the impact of the property slump in third and fourth-tier cities by becoming more nimble.28%jump in sales for Samsonite in the first half of this year after it shifted its focus to affordable productsHe explains that his division, Haier Electronics, has focused on selling high-tech washing machines to better-off consumers, promoting low-cost water heaters in rural areas and making a big push into e-commerce and logistics after signing a partnership with Alibaba, the Chinese internet group, in 2013.In the first half of the year, sales of air conditioners and refrigerators dropped but Haier Electronics reported an increase of 4-5 per cent in sales of washing machines and water heaters.“For white goods suppliers, sales really differ across categories,” says Catherine Chan, an analyst at Citigroup in Hong Kong. “Where we see growth, it is by increases in average sales prices, not just higher volumes, as people upgrade to better models.”Other leading consumer companies have seen similar divergences in their product lines.Want Want, which sells snacks and drinks, saw milk sales fall by 3 per cent year on year in the first half, while rice crackers sales jumped by 10 per cent because of promotional campaigns.Belle International, China’s biggest shoe retailer, closed 167 of its more than 20,000 stores in the three months to May as sales at its footwear shops dropped by 8 per cent year on year.But its sportswear stores increased sales by 12 per cent in the same period, as it capitalised on the rising fitness trend in China.Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy at Macquarie in Hong Kong, says that while consumer companies have not delivered the stellar growth expected of them in the past, the best companies have managed to maintain their profits.“In other parts of the economy, like commodities and industrials, profits have been wiped out,” he explains. “When you include the growth of tourism, entertainment and e-commerce, we haven’t seen that much of a slowdown in the overall consumer sector.”Additional reporting by Gloria Cheung in Hong Kong and Jackie Cai in Shanghai
182;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-08-07T18:18:40Z;Adidas struggles to catch up with Nike’s runaway success;Better strategies for social media and appealing to youngsters offer scope for the German brand;"They say a picture paints a thousand words, but sometimes a number does it even better.Nike, the US sporting goods behemoth whose swoosh logo is as recognisable as its name, together with its Jordan brand, has built up a share of nearly 60 per cent share of the US market for trainers. Adidas has just 4.4 per cent.The German group is far more competitive in sports clothing and markets outside the US. The duo are neck-and-neck in western Europe, Adidas is a long way ahead in Russia, and Nike has a narrow lead in China.But Nike’s dominance in the world’s most important market for trainers gives it a painfully sharp edge on Adidas, which has adopted a strategy to claw back share in sportswear, with an emphasis on the US. With such a big gap to close in footwear, Adidas has a mammoth task on its hands.“Outside the US there is much greater parity between Nike and Adidas. But the US is the epicentre of the global sneaker/‘athleisure’ market,” says Matt Powell, sports industry analyst at research firm NPD, which calculated the market share data. “Ultimately, to win globally, sneaker brands must win in the US. Nike has a deep and rich understanding of the US sneaker consumer.”Nike has been a runaway success over the past five years. It is the world’s biggest sportswear company by sales and in the year to June 2015 revenues rose a tenth, to $30.6bn. Adidas, meanwhile, reported a 6 per cent rise in revenues on a currency-neutral basis to €14.5bn, for the full year 2014.Profit at Nike has increased at a double-digit rate — even though its overseas business is grappling with a cripplingly strong dollar that has made its prices less competitive. Adidas will need to add sales at a brisk pace to even maintain the existing gap with Nike.The western European market shows how tough this race will be. Over the past three years, the sales growth of the Nike brand has outstripped that of the German group’s Adidas and Reebok brands by 10 percentage points on average, once currency fluctuations are excluded, according to analysts at UBS.The result is that Adidas and Nike are now level in the region that has been the German company’s stronghold. Euromonitor, a market research provider, calculates that both groups had a 12.8 per cent share of the western European sportswear market in 2014.“Alarmingly for Adidas, Nike has caught up in its core western Europe market, and may overtake it in the short term,” says Natasha Cazin, senior analyst at Euromonitor International.She notes Nike’s aggressive push in the region has helped it gain market share and made it the leading brand in seven European countries.Even maintaining the dead heat in which Adidas now finds itself with Nike could be hard, says Zuzanna Pusz, an analyst at Berenberg. “Adidas is doing fine in western Europe, but they should be as they are spending 14 per cent of their sales on marketing,” she says. “The question is whether this is sustainable. The average for the industry is between 10 and 11 per cent.”A recent survey by analysts at UBS also found signs of Nike’s surge, particularly among the young. The survey looked at how many times consumers “liked” Facebook pages associated with sports brands, and found that Nike was far ahead of its rivals in the big European markets — and recently overtook Adidas in Germany.UBS also found that the perception of Nike’s brand exceeded that of Adidas in London and Paris, two of the six cities around the world that Adidas is focusing on as part of its efforts to regain ground on its US rival.“Adidas undoubtedly needs to improve brand perceptions among younger consumers. But the good news is that we think it has a big opportunity to achieve this by placing a bigger focus on social media, leveraging its sponsorship asset base, and creating more relevant product for the target teenager,” the analysts wrote.Adidas’s recent overhaul of its football boot range — it replaced its Predator and F50 lines with two newcomers, Ace and X — is seen as one way in which it can renew its appeal among teenagers.The company has also taken steps to improve its position in the fast-growing area of fitness tracking, snapping up app developer Runtastic. Ms Pusz says focusing on sports software is the right way to go, but adds that Adidas is trying to catch up instead of setting the pace.Nike is by far the trendsetter in its home market. Not only does it have the financial clout when it comes to endorsements, it was quick off the mark in recognising the importance of social media and advertisements on YouTube. During the recent women’s World Cup in Canada, although Adidas was the main sponsor, Nike emerged victorious in terms of social media engagement. Its #NoMaybes campaign was 121 per cent more associated with the World Cup than Adidas, according to Amobee Brand Intelligence.However, it is an area again where Adidas has the potential to catch up and win over more millennials. It plans to improve marketing, be more innovative with its products and bring them more quickly to market.“Adidas has made the right decisions to move global product and marketing to the US,” NPD’s Mr Powell says. “Hopefully they will develop a less European-centric point of view.”It helps Adidas that the so-called athleisure wear trend is strengthening. As more people wear casual sports clothes in situations — even work — that were once considered more formal, there is room for many companies to expand.However, this also means there are more companies to overtake it. Under Armour, a relative newcomer, last year sold more trainers, tracksuits and T-shirts than Adidas in the US.And fashion is fickle. Some analysts question whether sports brands really benefit by focusing on chasing trends or working with celebrities — as Adidas is doing with Kanye West after the pop star dropped his relationship with Nike. Paul Swinand of Morningstar says that for a company whose raison d'être is performance — which breeds loyalty — chasing fashion ultimately only gives short-term gains and is “off brand”.*As Adidas implements its strategy in the US, Nike is maintaining the pace of growth investors have come to expect. “They’ve gotten such strong growth in apparel and basketball, it just can’t go on forever; you can’t have 15-20 per cent growth forever,” Mr Swinland says.Yet being Nike’s rival must feel tough. “Impossible is nothing”, or so goes Adidas’s slogan. It will be hoping it does not prove itself wrong.When Adidas and Nike make headlines in China, it is often because workers at one of their suppliers in the “world’s workshop” has gone on strike in manufacturing centres such as Dongguan, writes Tom Mitchell in Beijing. But, as Adidas seeks to make up ground on Nike globally, the two companies’ executives, investors and analysts are paying attention to China as an important market in its own right.In announcing its second-quarter results on Thursday, Adidas highlighted a 19 per cent increase in its Greater China sales, adjusted for currency fluctuations.With second-quarter revenues of €564m ($615m), Greater China is the third-largest market for Adidas after western Europe and North America. It is also the company’s second-most profitable one, with a gross margin of 59 per cent.Similarly, Nike’s Greater China profits in the three months to the end of June ($266m) were almost as big as western Europe’s ($277m), despite much smaller revenues — $829m in Greater China compared with $1.2bn in western Europe.Reflecting the wealth disparities that make China both a manufacturing powerhouse and coveted retail market, a top-of-the-range pair of Nike’s LeBron basketball boots sells for the equivalent of $275 in China, compared with a monthly minimum wage in Dongguan of $210.Analysts say Adidas and Nike have adopted different approaches to the market, which failed to take off as anticipated after the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, leaving many brands with stocks that took years to clear.“Nike has gone through the basketball route, focusing on celebrity endorsements, while Adidas has taken a more grassroots focus aimed at youth culture,” says Matthew Crabbe, a retail analyst with Mintel. Adidas has, for example, collaborated with popular actress Fan Bingbing on fashion collections.But both companies face a tough retail climate because China’s economy is now growing at its slowest annual rate for 25 years — a phenomenon government officials refer to as “the new normal”.“With the weak economy consumers are looking for more value,” says Shaun Rein, a Shanghai-based retail consultant. “Adidas has been more focused on fashion and consumers tend to shy away from fashion in weak economic times.”*An earlier version of this story misspelt Paul Swinand’s surname"
183;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-08-06T16:58:59Z;Adidas: in the bunker;The sportswear company should sell its golf business;"Mark Twain may or may not have described golf as “a good walk spoiled”. But the woeful performance of golf is certainly spoiling Herbert Hainer’s plan to reinvigorate Adidas, where he is chief executive. The German sportswear company has appointed advisers to review options for TaylorMade-adidas Golf.These could include selling just the hardware side of the business (clubs) and retaining the better-performing footwear and apparel lines; or selling the division entirely. In the meantime, it is implementing a turnround plan for the division based on marketing, pricing and supply chain management.It should save itself the bother and sell the division. Golf is structurally challenged. Huge numbers of people watch it — and it will feature in the Olympics next year — but despite swelling ranks of baby boomers, fewer people are actually playing it. Membership of clubs is falling in both Europe and the US, and growth in Asia is not yet making good this decline. US golf specialist Callaway was forced to downgrade its full-year guidance a few weeks ago, while same-store sales at Golf Galaxy (a retailer) fell 11 per cent in its most recent quarter. Even the mighty Nike could only grow golf sales at 2 per cent in the year to May.It is also not clear that investors have the patience for yet another Adidas turnround plan; the golf business was restructured in 2014, seemingly to little avail, while reaction to a broader strategic revamp announced earlier this year has hardly been euphoric. That relaunch was based in large part around appealing to “millennials” and urbanites in six global cities. It is hard to see how golf fits in with this agenda.There is also the issue of management time. Golf accounts for 6 per cent of group sales. If Adidas is serious about closing the gap with Nike, whose operating margins and returns on capital are twice its own, then it can ill-afford distractions. Mr Hainer should play to Adidas’s strengths — particularly in running and football, where results are more promising — overcome the nostalgia and get out of golf.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
184;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
185;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-08-02T16:49:52Z;Dollar strength slices $100bn off US company revenues;Stronger greenback adds to difficulties in seeking growth abroad;The sharp rise in the US dollar may slice more than $100bn off dollar-denominated revenues at some of America’s largest multinationals this year, a sum larger than the sales of Nike, McDonald’s and Goldman Sachs combined, according to a Financial Times analysis.In the first half of the year, 10 of the largest American multinationals have had their sales reduced by a combined $31bn — including blue-chip companies like Apple, General Motors, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Amazon and General Electric — and concerns have mounted that a move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates later this year will push the dollar higher.“Large multinationals are taking a hit from the stronger US currency,” David Lebovitz, market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, said. “You have downward pressure on the euro and yen coming from central banks in those regions and given a relatively unfavourable backdrop in emerging markets, we’re seeing currency depreciation there.”Companies within the S&P 500 earned roughly 48 per cent of their revenues abroad in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. A weak US dollar in years past had bolstered American multinationals, which benefited when they translated sales earned abroad back into the greenback.But diverging monetary policies have pushed the trade-weighted dollar 19 per cent above year-ago levels, including a 22 per cent gain against the euro. That has depressed so-called top-line growth, particularly for internet and technology groups, which earn more of their revenues outside the US than any other sector.You have downward pressure on the euro and yen coming from central banks in those regions and given a relatively unfavourable backdrop in emerging markets, we’re seeing currency depreciation thereAlthough more than 70 per cent of companies within the S&P 500 have beaten earnings expectations, just 42 per cent have eclipsed sales projections — 41 per cent have fallen short of consensus revenue forecasts.While US companies often leave foreign earnings abroad to avoid US taxes, the dollar can compress margins and profit for companies that manufacture and sell goods in different currencies. Executives must often choose to raise prices in countries where the currency has weakened or earn less on the same goods they did a year ago to remain competitive with foreign groups.“This whole expansion has not been strong in terms of revenue growth,” said David Lefkowitz, an equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. Mr Lefkowitz said UBS believed the dollar would shave roughly 3 to 4 per cent from total S&P 500 revenues of $10.7tn this year, or upwards of $300bn.“The market has been . . . gauging results in constant currency terms instead of looking at headline numbers,” he added. “The dollar stopped rising in March of this year and it has been fluctuating in a bit of a range. If the dollar does resume its upward trajectory the market would take notice and it could be more of an issue for multinationals.”The FT analysis showed a $28.9bn loss to sales in the second quarter so far, or roughly 3.3 per cent of the $863bn in reported revenues. The figures compare with $23bn in the first three months of the year, or 2.7 per cent of first-quarter revenues.The report covered more than 100 of the US corporates in the S&P 500 that have reported both first and second-quarter earnings — and was limited by the lack of disclosure of foreign exchange effects from dozens of companies.The figure itself is somewhat amorphous as companies must consider structural changes to operations, volume growth and acquisitions or divestitures when tallying an effect from the dollar.While the dollar has no doubt hit sales of corporates exposed to global demand trends and currency fluctuations, it has provided companies leeway to hurdle bottom-line expectations, noted Jill Hall, US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“Foreign-exposed companies have had a higher proportion of earnings surprises than domestic companies, because estimates were cut so much that now they’re easily beating expectations,” she said. “We’ve seen the worst of estimates cuts.”
186;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Foreign clothing brands extend advantage in China;Domestic brands that have borne the brunt of clothing market slowdown;Foreign sportswear brands have outperformed their local rivals in recent years. 61.0 per cent of respondents in our most recent survey of urban Chinese consumers selected foreign brands when asked to name their most regularly purchased sportswear brand, compared with just 30.8 per cent that named domestic ones, a gap of 30.2 percentage points. 18 months prior, in 3Q13, the gap was just 8.9 percentage points.Similarly, rapid expansion by foreign brands has transformed the casualwear market. In our 1Q15 survey, 82.5 per cent of respondents said that a foreign brand was among their two most frequently bought casualwear brands, higher than the 73.0 per cent recorded for domestic ones. When we first started our quarterly consumer surveys in 2Q12, less than half of respondents regularly purchased foreign-brand casualwear.Sales for all sportswear brands, both foreign and domestic, have suffered due to weaker market conditions. Companies in the sector were forced to scale back operations following earlier overstocking and overly rapid expansion, as sporting apparel demand contracted, becoming less commonly worn in work and non-sports settings.Nevertheless, foreign sportswear manufacturers with stronger brands and far more sophisticated marketing performed solidly, cementing their advantage over domestic rivals. A combined 49.2 per cent of sportswear buyers in our 1Q15 survey said they regularly buy Nike or Adidas, the two leading multinational brands, down marginally YoY, but virtually unchanged from the 49.4 per cent that did so in our 1Q13 survey. In contrast, the proportion of respondents that said they most frequently buy sportswear from leading domestic brands Li-Ning and Anta has declined steadily, falling from 23.2 per cent in 1Q13 to 20.4 per cent in 1Q14 and 16.3 per cent in 1Q15. The latter two brands have struggled to deal with excess inventory in recent years.The advantage of multinational sports brands in first-tier cities remains clear. 52.8 per cent of respondents in these cities said they regularly buy Nike or Adidas products in 1Q15, compared with just 14.9 per cent for Li-Ning or Anta. The third-most-popular brand among this cohort was another multinational brand, US-based New Balance. However, the combined popularity of Nike and Adidas was down 7.4 percentage points year-on-year, with the two leading domestic brands stable YoY. Attempts by domestic brands to increase the sophistication of their brands and marketing may be having some effect, though competition from smaller international brands is also increasing.While there may be signs of hope in higher-tier cities for Li-Ning and Anta, leading multinationals are now gaining ground in lower-tier markets previously dominated by local players. 44.7 per cent of third-tier city respondents in 1Q15 said they regularly buy Nike and Adidas, up from 41.7 per cent in 1Q14 and 39.7 per cent in 1Q13. The popularity of Li-Ning and Anta among this cohort declined steadily over this period from 29.4 per cent in 1Q13 to 18.4 per cent in 1Q15.Domestic brands nevertheless continue to hold an advantage among lower-income consumers. 29.4 per cent of those with annual household incomes below Rmb50,000 ($8,059) said they regularly buy Li-Ning and Anta, while a further 23.1 per cent selected domestic brands Peak and Xtep. Just 18.9 per cent of this cohort said they regularly buy Nike or Adidas products.Looking forward, Nike in particular appears well placed to retain its leadership of the China sportswear market. Its positioning as a dedicated sports equipment brand should allow it to tap into growing sports participation and health consciousness. Furthermore, it has invested heavily in technology, launching its bespoke NIKEiD service – aimed at China’s post-90s generation of consumers – enabling buyers to order customised shoes and clothing both in-store and on its website.Domestic brands have made progress in clearing excess inventories and closing underperforming stores in recent years, and some are also looking online to tap into growing demand for customisation among younger consumers. Peak, for example, recently invested in IDX, an internet portal allowing consumers to upload their own product designs, which are then delivered within seven days. It remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this will help Peak rebound, given competition from multinationals.Foreign brands also continue to lead the way in China’s casualwear sector. The three leading brands in our most recent survey were all foreign, with Japanese brand Uniqlo (operated by Fast Retailing) extending its lead. 27.6 per cent of over 1,800 casualwear buyers surveyed said they regularly buy Uniqlo casualwear, up 4.9 percentage points quarter-on-quarter and 5.9 percentage points year-on-year. Other multinational brands, including H&M, Inditex’s Zara, and Gap, also gained in popularity.Growing consumer awareness of international casualwear brands has been fuelled by their rapid expansion in lower-tier cities. 19.5 per cent of respondents in third-tier cities said they regularly buy clothing and accessories from Uniqlo, up 7.9 percentage points year-on-year, and 14.6 per cent from Zara, up 6.4 percentage points year-on-year. This improvement has largely come at the expense of domestic firms, with the overall popularity of Metersbonwe and Semir down 2.5pp and 0.7 percentage points year-on-year, respectively, to 8.2 per cent and 5.8 per cent in 1Q15, despite their extensive physical retail presence across the country.Foreign brands have boosted their images through sophisticated marketing. Gap, for example, has focused on storytelling in its marketing campaigns, Aina Konold, the CFO of Gap Greater China, told FT Confidential Research, adding that this had helped to forge better connections with consumers.Nevertheless, concerted efforts to rebrand and overhaul product lines should enable some domestic casualwear brands to return to positive sales growth in the coming year, albeit from low bases. Moreover, some local challengers, such as Heilan Home, have bucked the trend of scaling back among domestic brands, continuing to expand nationwide thanks to an innovative semi-self-operated business model, which reduces the cost of expansion, supported by investment in smart logistics and IT systems that have automated much of its stock management and distribution. In our 1Q15 survey, its popularity rose 3.1 percentage points year-on-year to 8.5 per cent. The success of Heilan Home, and signs of gradual recovery among other Chinese firms, has helped domestic brands rebuild a degree of popularity. 73.0 per cent of casualwear buyers said they regularly purchase a domestic brand in our most recent survey, up 4.1 percentage points quarter-on-quarter.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

187;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-07-03T11:31:25Z;Nike co-founder Knight steps down from unrivalled sports empire;Man behind the swoosh leaves a global brand with over $30bn in annual revenues;For Phil Knight, after half a century at the helm of Nike, there is a finish line in sight.This week Mr Knight said he would step down from chairing the company he co-founded as Blue Ribbon Sports in 1964 as a journalism graduate from the University of Oregon with his athletics coach, Bill Bowerman. He first sold Japan’s Onitsuka trainers from his car before Mr Bowerman used a waffle iron to manufacture their first pair of sneakers.From those humble beginnings, Mr Knight, 77, built a global brand and swept up 35 per cent of the US sneakers market, underpinned by the instantly recognisable swoosh logo. Nike’s products turned into a lifestyle for consumers, scooping nearly $30bn a year in annual revenues and inspiring others to emulate it.Stephen Greyser, professor at Harvard Business School specialising in sports marketing, compares him to Julia Child, “who changed what Americans cooked” as Mr Knight revolutionised what “Americans wore on their feet”.“The development of the swoosh as being equal to Nike is one of the most important contributions to branding identity that any company has made.”Mr Knight is as low profile as Nike is famous. Rarely without his sunglasses, his career has been the embodiment of Nike’s motto “just do it”, employed to inspire athletes and weekend warriors to take to the track — wearing its trainers. It has earned the lover of Japanese aesthetics about $24.5bn in the process, according to Forbes.It was under Mr Knight that Nike set the standard for endorsing athletes — through rigorous research — most notably Michael Jordan. The basketball star became such a global sports celebrity that he reportedly once tied for second place in a Chinese poll for the greatest man ever. Nike gained a huge sub-brand in Air Jordan.While Nike’s slogan “there is no finish line” does not quite ring true any more for Mr Knight, the middle-distance runner is not fully over the white line yet.He will step down as chairman some time next year, to be succeeded by his chief executive of nine years, Mark Parker. Mr Knight plans to continue contributing to Nike, and he has transferred 15 per cent, representing the majority of his stake in Nike, to a newly formed company, called Swoosh. His son Travis will also join the Nike board.“For me, Nike has always been more than just a company — it has been my life’s passion,” Mr Knight said this week.While this passion has been central to Nike’s sharp brand focus, it has not been a steady jog to the top.The company miscalculated the aerobics craze of the 1980s, enabling rival Reebok temporarily to overtake its sales. It also made a failed attempt in the casual shoes business.The development of the swoosh as being equal to Nike is one of the most important contributions to branding identity that any company has madeNike was also caught in several major scandals over poor working conditions and pay at the factories of its Asian subcontractors in the 1990s. And not all celebrity endorsements have been successful.Most recently concerns have grown that Nike could be dragged into the Fifa bribery scandal, though it has not been named nor accused of any wrongdoing and is co-operating with authorities. Learning from mistakes, it remains the world’s most valuable apparel brand.As Mr Knight hands over the chairman’s reins there are young upstarts such as Under Armour making waves amid the ubiquity of athleisure wear, though they are currently minnows by comparison. Nike’s latest stellar results showed it remained the US athletic shoe leader.“The future looks bright for [Nike] and for the industry,” says Matt Powell, sports industry analyst at NPD Group. “We have become a casual world today.”
188;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-06-26T16:37:48Z;June is busiest month this year for US companies listing shares;Pace of IPOs in 2015 lags behind first half of 2014;The initial public offering from Fitbit, the maker of wearable fitness tracking devices, arrived in the busiest month of the year so far for US equity market listings by companies.Twenty companies have floated during June on US exchanges, marking the busiest month since November, according to data provider S&P Capital IQ.June also ranks as the top month of the year for money raised, with IPOs raking in $4.74bn. The level of activity was modestly above May, when 19 companies went public, but is double the level in March.Richard Peterson, director at S&P Capital IQ, said the recent uptick in activity might partly reflect bankers looking to complete deals and “get league table credit as well as book fees” before the first half of the year concludes next Tuesday.Despite the stronger numbers in June, the pace of IPOs in 2015 is tepid compared to the same time in 2014: 89 companies have gone public in the US, raising $16.1bn so far this year.That’s well below the 144 companies that listed during the first six months of 2014, with $30.7bn in proceeds, according to S&P Capital IQ.Univar won top honours in June by raising $770m, but its flotation ranks third behind Tallgrass Energy and Columbia Pipeline Partners in terms of money raised so far this year.Chicken wing restaurant chain, Wingstop, experienced the biggest opening-trade pop in June, rising nearly 61 per cent, but that was half of the 124 per cent gain seen in Shake Shack shares, when they started trading in January.Nike led the benchmark S&P 500 on Friday, rising 4 per cent to $109.70, after the athletic apparel and footwear maker reported better than expected results in its latest quarter as it benefits from the trend of wearing activewear outside the gym.Nike’s profits jumped to $865m, or 98 cents a share, from $698m, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose nearly 5 per cent to $7.8bn. That eclipsed Wall Street forecasts of 84 cents a share and sales of $7.7bn.Nike said global future orders scheduled for delivery between July and September, an indicator of the company’s future revenue, rose 2 per cent.However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, future orders were up 13 per cent — ahead of forecasts of a 10.4 per cent gain.Micron Technology was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, after the chipmaker said weakness in the PC market weighed on its fiscal third-quarter results.The Boise, Idaho-based company reported profits of $491m, or 42 cents a share, compared with $806m, or 68 cents a share, in the year ago period. Sales slipped 3 per cent to $3.85bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 53 cents a share, on sales of $3.9bn.Shares of Micron Technology fell 18 per cent to $19.66.US stocks fluctuated as markets await the latest news on Greece ahead of the June 30 deadline.The S&P 500 was little changed at 2,101.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.3 per cent to 17,947.02.

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Stagecoach was given a boost last week after the UK competition authorities formally cleared it to take on the London-to-Edinburgh East Coast rail franchise.The Competition and Markets Authority had questioned the government’s decision to hand the contract to Stagecoach and Virgin Rail, citing concerns over their market share on sections of the London-Scotland route. But the clearance removes any clouds hanging over the lucrative contract at the transport company’s full-year results on Wednesday.Analysts said investors would be watching closely for early indications of how the franchise, which was awarded in November and began in March, is going. The contract will start adding to earnings in the 2015-16 financial year.The group will also give an update on the performance of its US Megabus business, which has been suffering from slowing revenue growth as falling oil prices led to more people driving.In April, Stagecoach warned that it remained “cautious” on the short-term prospects for Megabus revenue growth in the US as the fuel price drop persists. Tanya PowleyAs what looks to be a Mexican stand-off between Monsanto and the target of its unsolicited bid, Switzerland-based Syngenta, drags on, investors will be looking for hints for the US seeds and chemicals group’s next move as it announces its third-quarter results.Some were surprised at the language Syngenta used when it rejected Monsanto’s latest approach earlier this month after the US company sweetened its $45bn cash and share offer earlier this month with a $2bn break-up fee.Syngenta said the termination fee was “paltry” and the SFr449 ($485) a share offer “grossly inadequate”. This was deemed by some M&A experts as particularly strong, even if Monsanto failed to up its offer price.The US agricultural seeds and chemicals company is pursuing a “tax inversion” acquisition of rival Syngenta, with the merged entity to be domiciled in the UK under a new name.The quarterly results are expected to reveal how the continuing sluggishness in agricultural markets and falling farmers’ incomes is affecting Monsanto’s business.But the US group’s management is likely to spend more time answering questions about political risks surrounding the Syngenta transaction as well as the regulatory risks surrounding the deal.

Stagecoach, FY: 25.8p (25.8p)Investors in Hennes & Mauritz will be hoping the Swedish clothing retailer can do the same for profitability in the second quarter as it did for revenues.The purveyor of cheap chic reported second-quarter sales up 21 per cent to SKr45.9bn, ahead of analysts’ expectation of SKr44.7bn. Revenues in the quarter to the end of May were helped by the weakness of the Swedish crown even though clothing sales in Germany — H&M’s biggest market — were weak.There is likely to be close attention paid to H&M’s gross margin on Thursday — an important gauge of profitability for retailers — with some worry among investors of how the Swedish company is likely to pay more to source its clothes.Inditex, H&M’s long-time rival and the Spanish owner of Zara, earlier this month reported its strongest quarterly profit growth in more than two years as it reaped the rewards from a weaker euro. Net profit in its first quarter, which runs to the end of April, increased 28 per cent. Richard MilneNike is expected to post a solid rise in fourth-quarter earnings, although its healthy profits could be overshadowed by a scandal at Fifa that has threatened to entangle the world’s largest sportswear brand.The consensus analyst estimate is for earnings per share of 0.83 cents, a 6.8 per cent rise, on the back of a 3.4 per cent increase in sales to $7.7bn for the three months to May 31. The anticipated rise follows an earlier estimate by the company for orders between March and July to rise 11 per cent in constant currencies.Strong profits on the back of demand for its sportswear have helped boost the company’s shares despite wide public interest in concerns that the company might end up embroiled in the bribery scandal at Fifa. The shares are up 3.1 per cent since the story unravelled at the end of May and are up 11 per cent this year.The company has not been named in any indictment associated with the scandal. But a deal that US prosecutors have referred to appears identical to one signed by Nike and Brazil’s football federation CBF in 1996.Nike has declined to comment on whether or not it is the unnamed company mentioned in the indictment. In separate statements in May, it said that it has been co-operating with the authorities and will continue to do so, and that the documents do not allege that it engaged in criminal conduct, or that any employee was aware of or knowingly participated in any scheme.It has pushed ahead with more deals with key sports associations.

190;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-06-15T22:09:08Z;Opinion: Could Cuba be Vietnam in the Caribbean?;The island has the resources and location to create a balanced economy;What might Cuba look like a decade or two from now, when its ageing revolutionary leadership has faded from view? Consider the remarkable economic success of Vietnam, once a highly centralised planned economy as Cuba is today.Vietnam has evolved into a hybrid system with a dynamic interplay between a hefty public sector of state-owned enterprises, a vibrant and expanding private entrepreneurial class and an influx of global brands: the likes of Nike, Honda, Canon and Samsung employ millions of Vietnamese.Vietnam’s surging economy is also well diversified, exporting rice, fish and minerals, hosting tourists and participating in cross-border manufacturing supply chains. Domestically, the construction and real estate businesses — driven by foreign and domestic investors — are booming, and efficient telecommunications empower the ambitious Vietnamese middle classes to fixate on Facebook.By the standards of developing countries, Vietnam’s big cities are refreshingly people-friendly. Hanoi is proud of its greenery while Ho Chi Minh City is attractively remodelling the banks of its winding canals. Abundant affordable public housing prevents the shocking slums that surround so many Asian and Latin American population centres. Vietnamese eateries offer a healthy local diet of vegetables, fresh fish and rice noodles, and locals drive fuel-efficient motorbikes.But Vietnam has weaknesses. Corruption is rife. Inequality is glaring and widening. People complain about poor-quality social services. And many deeply resent the lack of political freedoms and the monopoly of the Communist party.So what can Cuba learn from Vietnam?The government could relax the constraints it puts on entrepreneurs. President Raúl Castro could transform his words of welcome to foreign investment into rapid authorisations of tangible capital projects. State-owned firms could partner with domestic and international businesses.As Vietnam did, Cuba could quickly shift from being a large net importer to a net exporter of agriculture and fisheries. It must allow farmers to earn healthy profits, while creating distribution networks that supply essential inputs and that market foodstuffs at home and abroad.Cuba has the requisite resources — natural and human — and the location to create a balanced economy. It has fertile soil. Capable scientists have begun building a biotech cluster and the many computer engineers await opportunities that will come with global interconnectedness. The island could again become a shipping and logistics hub. And exotic Cuba could draw a variety of tourists, offering urban culture, eco-resorts, maritime sports, as well as traditional sun and surf.As it evolves into a more open and market-driven economy, Cuba can improve upon Vietnam’s experienceIf Cuban cities are to preserve their charm and liveability, urban planners must be empowered to preserve public spaces and ensure plentiful affordable housing and attractive public transport. Already, the brilliant if slow-paced renewal of Havana’s Old City is a promising precedent.Avoiding the pitfalls of corruption and inequality will be difficult. But Cuba has advantages: a well-educated and politically aware middle class will probably demand better governance once it has internet connections and social media. With a western legal tradition, Cuba may be more open to monitoring by corporate auditors and non-profit watchdogs.As Cuba enlarges its narrow socialist wage differentials, inequalities will grow. But socialist mores run deep and racial and gender divides have narrowed. Debates about market efficiency and equality can be heard in seminar rooms and on city streets. With its superior social services, Cuba has another edge. But its universal education and healthcare facilities have deteriorated and only a more vibrant economy can generate the resources that high-quality services require.Vietnam’s Communist party can survive in an authoritarian Asia, but can a one-party state endure in the democratic Caribbean? Only time will tell, but even in Vietnam, economic pluralism has opened space for a more tolerant and evolving political system.As it evolves into a more open and market-driven economy, Cuba can improve upon Vietnam’s experience. Cubans can study Vietnam’s mixed and diversified economy, while eschewing rampant corruption and offensive inequalities and conserving impressive social achievements.Richard E. Feinberg is professor of international political economy at the University of California, San Diego, non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of “Soft Landing in Cuba?

191;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-28T23:54:45Z;Fifa corruption scandal threatens to entangle Nike;US sportswear company is a long-time sponsor of the Brazilian national football team;The growing scandal over corruption at Fifa threatens to entangle Nike, the US sportswear company that is a sponsor of the Brazilian national football squad, and other multinational sponsors of the game in Latin America.The Swiss incumbent is expected to win a fifth four-year term as president in Friday’s electionContinue readingUS prosecutors alleged in an indictment that an intermediary, a company controlled by Brazilian businessman José Hawilla, helped secure a landmark $160m, 10-year sponsorship deal in 1996 between an unnamed sportswear company and the country’s football federation, or CBF, by paying bribes.Prosecutors did not name Nike in their indictment, which was filed to a US district court, referring to it as “sportswear company A” or “E” in two separate documents. They have not accused it of any crime.But the deal by the unnamed company described in the two indictments appears identical to the one signed by Nike and CBF in 1996.Nike said that it “believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities.”In a later statement the company said: “The charging documents unsealed yesterday in Brooklyn do not allege that Nike engaged in criminal conduct. There is no allegation in the charging documents that any Nike employee was aware of or knowingly participated in any bribery or kickback scheme.”The website of Traffic, Mr Hawilla’s company, mentions a deal in 1996 with Nike as one of its landmark transactions. Nike’s sponsorship of the Brazilian team was also at the centre of a congressional inquiry into football in Brazil in 2001.A number of Fifa’s biggest sponsors, including Visa and Coca-Cola, were quick to speak out about the allegations of corruption and fraud that have engulfed world football’s governing body and some of its affiliates.The allegations swirling around the Nike contract will be closely watched by multinationals interested in participating in Brazil and Latin America’s increasingly lucrative sports advertising market.Successive CBF chairmen have endured a number of scandals but until now had emerged unscathed.In their indictment, US prosecutors said the unnamed sportswear company approached the CBF about a sponsorship deal around 1994.The CBF and Traffic, which was then its marketing agent, began negotiations with the company.Under the deal eventually signed with Nike in 1996, the CBF agreed to remit a percentage of the payments it received from the sportswear company to Mr Hawilla’s Traffic.Mr Hawilla, who has pleaded guilty in the case as part of a plea-bargain agreement, then agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal as kickbacks to a senior member of the CBF board, identified in the indictment as “co-conspirator 11”.Prosecutors said that “co-conspirator 11” was also at various times a high-ranking official of Fifa and Conmebol, the South American football confederation.The prosecutors said additional financial terms between Traffic and the unnamed sportswear company were not reflected in the CBF agreement.Under these additional terms, the unnamed company agreed to pay a Traffic affiliate with a Swiss bank account an additional $40m in “base compensation” on top of the $160m it paid the CBF.Three days later, the unnamed company and Traffic signed a one-page contract saying that the CBF had authorised Traffic to invoice the unnamed company directly “for marketing fees earned upon successful negotiation and performance of the . . . [agreement]”, it is alleged.Corruption allegations are unlikely to rattle the financial powerhouse that governs world footballFull storyThe 10-year sponsorship was terminated in early 2002. Nike is the current kit sponsor of the Brazilian national team.The prosecutors also alleged that a sports marketing company involved in the negotiation of sponsorship deals for the Copa Libertadores, the South American championship run by Conmebol, paid bribes to secure the exclusive rights.Toyota became the tournament’s first title sponsor in 1998, followed by Santander in 2008 and Bridgestone Corporation starting in 2013.The prosecutors alleged that a sports marketing company, identified only as “sports marketing company A” and based in New Jersey, paid a series of bribes mainly to Nicolás Leoz, who was the president of Conmebol between 1986 and 2013, and a member of Fifa’s executive committee.The payments, which started in the early 2000s, were in exchange for his support for the sports marketing company securing the exclusive rights to the tournament.Santander declined to comment. Toyota and Bridgestone were not immediately available for comment.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s president, said this week she welcomed the Fifa investigation, saying the country’s normally aggressive public prosecutors had been unable to tackle alleged corruption in football in the country because it was run by private organisations.“I say that if it needs to be investigated, investigate it — all the World Cups, everything,” she told reporters on a trip to Mexico.Additional reporting by Robert Wright in New York
192;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-28T04:57:52Z;Sponsors step up pressure on Fifa over corruption probe;Football body’s partners voice concerns over investigations;Companies close to Fifa have stepped up pressure on football’s governing body, after US and Swiss authorities combined to charge current and former officials with racketeering, money laundering and fraud.Coca-Cola and Visa were among several major sponsors of Fifa’s World Cup to speak out.The US payments company said its disappointment was “profound” and “should Fifa fail [to make changes], we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship”.Coca-Cola said the scandal had “tarnished the mission and ideals” of the quadrennial tournament, the final of which was watched last year by more than 1bn fans around the world. The US drinks company said it had “repeatedly” aired its concerns over long-simmering allegations of corruption at Fifa, and that it expected football’s governing body to tackle the matter “thoroughly” while co-operating with authorities.The statements were among the strongest from a group of sponsors embarrassed by their association with Fifa, organiser of the World Cup since 1930, which earns about 90 per cent of its revenues from selling television, marketing, hospitality and licensing rights. Coca-Cola has had sponsorship deals at every event since Brazil hosted the tournament in 1950 and had signed up to be a top-tier sponsor of the 2018 and 2022 events alongside Adidas, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Hyundai and Visa.Last year’s tournament in Brazil broke viewing records in key territories such as the US and Germany, according to Fifa, which said it had reached 451m Facebook users with official content.Dean Crutchfield, an independent brand consultant based in New York, said sponsors might look to renegotiate their contracts in view of the scandal.Tim Halloran, president of Atlanta-based Romance the Brand, said companies were likely to weigh the risk of collateral damage from the scandal against the brand visibility generated by the tournament: “Is what I’m trying to leverage out of Fifa, is that still trumping what is going on behind the scenes?”Adidas must be careful that its Fifa sponsorship does not become a reputational risk and damage its brandAdidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear group, urged Fifa to bolster its compliance standards but stopped short of saying it would cancel its sponsorship deal.Adidas “is fully committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance, and we expect the same from our partners”, the German group said. “Following today’s news, we can therefore only encourage Fifa to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards in everything they do.”Union Investment, one of Adidas’s top 20 shareholders with a 0.9 per cent holding, warned that any association with Fifa could cause difficulties.“Adidas must be careful that its Fifa sponsorship does not become a reputational risk and damage its brand,” said Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager at the Frankfurt-based investor.Three key issues now come into focus: the future of not only Sepp Blatter, but also Fifa, as well as the 2018 and 2022 World CupsRead moreHyundai, the South Korean carmaker that along with affiliate Kia is Fifa’s “official automotive partner” for all competitions until 2022, expressed anxiety.“As a company that places the highest priority on ethical standards and transparency, we are extremely concerned about the legal proceedings being taken against certain Fifa executives and will continue to monitor this situation closely,” the company said in a statement.McDonald’s, the fast food company that is one of the second-tier sponsors of the 2018 World Cup, described news of the government investigation as “extremely concerning”, adding that it “takes matters of ethics and corruption very seriously”. It said it was in contact with Fifa over the matter and would continue to monitor the situation closely.Nike, the sportswear group, said it was “concerned” by the “very serious” allegations. “We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities,” it added.Sony allowed its eight-year, $305m contract with Fifa to expire in December. On Thursday the company declined to comment on the US indictment but people familiar with the matter said Sony officials had previously expressed concerns about the widening allegations and the group’s association with Fifa.Also in December, three second-tier World Cup sponsors — Castrol, Continental and Johnson & Johnson — opted not to renew deals for the 2018 tournament in Russia.

193;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-27T17:57:44Z;US arrests man who owns Brazil football;José Hawilla agrees to return $151m after pleading guilty in the Fifa investigation;On hearing the news of the Fifa arrests on Wednesday morning, Brazilian World Cup great turned congressman Romário tweeted: “Unfortunately, it wasn’t our police who arrested them.”The remarks come as the US authorities appeared to have succeeded in one swoop in doing what their Brazilian counterparts have failed to do over many years — crack open the corrupt underbelly of football in the country.The guilty plea of José Hawilla, the owner and founder of Traffic Group, the sports media company that virtually controls the business of the sport in the country, strikes at the heart of the nation’s powerful football hierarchy.In a 2010 interview, newspaper O Globo described the businessman, now 71 years old and himself a former journalist and TV presenter, as “The owner of our football”.US authorities said Mr Hawilla waived indictment in December last year and pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering, money laundering and others and, as part of a plea bargain, agreed to return $151m.In a document filed with a US district court in New York, prosecutors alleged that Mr Hawilla, through Traffic over the past 20-25 years, paid bribes to various soccer federation officials to secure the TV rights to tournaments.They include the Copa América, the South American competition, and the Copa América Centenario, which will mark the tournament’s 100-year anniversary and is to be held next year.Mr Hawilla also allegedly paid bribes to secure the rights to the Gold Cup, held by the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Football Associations, or Concacaf, and the Copa do Brasil, Brazil`s top tournament.In 1996, he negotiated a sponsorship scheme for Brazil’s soccer federation, the CBF, with a large US sportswear company, which the document does not identify. He allegedly paid half of his fees from the deal to a high-ranking official from the CBF, who was also not identified.The amount of the bribes increased steadily over the years from “six figures” in dollar terms for the Copa America rights in the early 1990s to $100m that Mr Hawilla, through a joint venture called Datisa, allegedly agreed to pay to officials of Conmebol, the South American soccer confederation behind the Copa America, for a 10-year contract signed in 2013.A former bus-stop billboard company, Traffic was bought in 1980 by Mr Hawilla who wanted to branch out into football stadium advertising.In 1987, he took over rights to the Copa América, with Traffic boasting that it elevated the tournament to the “same level in terms of quality as the European leagues”.But one of his most far-reaching achievements came in 1996, when he claimed to have brokered an agreement between Nike and the CBF, making the sportswear company the major sponsor of the Brazilian “Seleção” or national team.He expanded to the US and Europe in the early 2000s, setting up branches there before entering into the business of investing in players in 2008, setting up investment funds that acquired the economic rights of professional players.He mixed with the highest echelons of power in Brazil, counting the governor of Brazil’s economic powerhouse, the state of São Paulo, among other politicians at a party to celebrate his company’s 30-year anniversary in 2010.O Globo said the group’s revenue was estimated at $500m, although Mr Hawilla has never revealed the true figure. He complained then that he was the target of rumours about spurious business dealings.“Even if you work honestly, with transparency and dignity, like I have always done, they talk,” he was quoted in O Globo as saying. “I think it is jealousy.”
194;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Adidas limbers up to get back in the race;German sportswear company looks to catch up with rivals Nike and Under Armour;The Latin term annus horribilis means a year when most things that can go wrong do go wrong. For Adidas, 2014 was pretty ghastly — a shock from which its staff, customers and shareholders must hope that the German sports company draws the right lessons.Some early signs point in a promising direction. But it is too much to expect 2015 to be an annus mirabilis, or miracle year. Adidas’s predicted operating margin of 7 per cent will probably turn out to be half that achieved by Nike, the world’s leading sportswear group by sales. Wednesday’s arrests of a group of Fifa officials on US corruption charges will not help, given Adidas’s role as a long-time official partner and supplier of the football World Cup.Still, not everything went badly last year for Adidas. In September, Dennis Kimetto, the Kenyan marathon star, knocked 26 seconds off the world record, clocking a time of 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He did it wearing a pair of springy Adidas Boost running shoes. A sportswear company can hardly ask for better publicity.More broadly, some factors that dragged down Adidas’s performance, such as Russian economic turbulence, were not its fault and are likely to be less disruptive in the future. But the bottom line is that Adidas’s share price slumped 38 per cent last year and its operating profit dropped 25 per cent.The shares have since recovered most of the lost ground, and Adidas’s first-quarter profits and sales beat expectations, easing pressure on management. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. Adidas’s 2005 acquisition of Reebok was supposed to herald an audacious assault on Nike’s global supremacy. But last year’s results highlighted weaknesses in Adidas’s business set-up that have been developing over a long period and are not susceptible to quick fixes.For example, revenues from its golf business alone tumbled 28 per cent, a result so dire that Adidas executives must be grateful that golf accounts for less than 10 per cent of group sales. Because of its relatively high costs and the sheer amount of time involved in playing the game, golf as an amateur sport has been in decline for more than a decade, not least in the US. Almost as if blind to this long-term trend, Adidas has persisted in thinking it can lure golfers into regular purchases of new products, especially clubs, which are often just modest upgrades of items they already own.A more troublesome signal is that Adidas fell last year into third place in the all-important US market for sports apparel and goods. To trail Nike, as Adidas generally does, may be no disgrace. But now, in the US, Adidas has slipped behind Under Armour, a fast-growing Baltimore-based business founded less than 20 years ago.28%Fall in revenues from Adidas’s golf businessThe explanation for this loss of competitive edge is fairly simple. Adidas has struggled to come up with a full range of products as innovative and stylish as those of Nike and Under Armour. Its marketing strategies are less astute and sometimes over-elaborate. A chronic difficulty is that Adidas tends to be more cumbersome than its rivals in responding to changing US market conditions. As one disgruntled investor told the German group’s annual general meeting on May 7: “Adidas lost the race, at least in 2014.”There are, however, some reasons to be positive about the outlook for Adidas, starting with the measured response of its senior executives to the company’s woes. Discontent with Herbert Hainer, chief executive, was bubbling last year among institutional shareholders. They had him down as a likeable sports team captain, who clings to his job after his best playing years are behind him.In post since 2001, Mr Hainer is the longest-serving CEO at a Dax-30 blue-chip German company. But the group’s supervisory board resisted any short-term temptation to dispense with his services. In the meantime, while they began a formal search for his successor, they asked him to develop a recovery plan. It calls for putting new product lines more quickly into stores, higher marketing budgets and turning around performance in the US and selected global cities.As far as one can tell, it does not involve drastic steps like selling Reebok. The company is emphasising steady, long-term plans over impulsive reactions to near-term difficulties. It is up to Mr Hainer to show that this approach — so often a virtue at big German companies — will work for Adidas, too.tony.barber@ft.com
195;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-11T10:56:52Z;Fitbit in rude financial health ahead of IPO;Questions raised over ability to maintain lead in increasingly competitive field;Fitbit has for years been seen as the leader of the fitness-tracker pack but for the first time it has disclosed just what an industry lead it holds.The San Francisco-based company has fended off competition in wearable wristbands from bigger brands such as Nike with its Fuelband, and other start-ups such as Jawbone with its UP range. Fitbit is responsible for about half of the market for bracelets and belt clips that monitor the wearer’s daily activity and sleep.When the company filed its prospectus for an initial public offering of at least $100m last week, even seasoned observers of the market were taken aback by the strength of its financial results. Fitbit increased its sales almost tenfold in the last two years, from $76m in 2012 to $745m in 2014.“I was shocked by how high their revenue number was,” says Julie Ask, a technology analyst at Forrester Research and fitness buff who has tried out most of the trackers on the market.Sales tripled to $337m in the first three months of this year ending in March compared with the same period a year earlier. Gross margin — a metric closely watched in the results of consumer electronics companies such as Apple and GoPro, the action-camera maker — also increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent.Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research, called the growth “phenomenal”. “These revenue growth and margin metrics help to explain why the company is going for an IPO now — the numbers are very, very good,” he said in a note on Friday.However, Mr Dawson and others question whether Fitbit can maintain its lead. It now finds itself batting against the world’s biggest technology companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung, which are all putting their considerable resources behind their own wearable-device initiatives and digital health platforms.It also faces increased competition from sportswear including Nike, whose Nike+ app is riding high in the app-store charts, and Under Armour, which paid $475m to acquire popular health app MyFitnessPal in February.Analysts disagree about how consumer demand for fitness trackers will be affected by smartwatches such as Apple Watch, Samsung’s Gear range and others that run Google’s Android Wear software.Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, predicts that the awareness of fitness tracking and wearable devices fuelled by Apple’s splashy arrival will create a “rising tide that will lift the whole market”, forecasting that sales of Fitbit-style sports bands will double from 40m to 80m between 2015 and 2018.Fitbit is in rude financial health, but can it fend off competition from the likes of Google and Apple? Ravi Mattu discusses the company’s prospects ahead of its IPO with Tim Bradshaw, FT San Francisco correspondent.He says standalone fitness trackers will remain appealing to people who prefer devices with longer battery life than smartwatches or do not want to give up their traditional wristwatch. Within that segment of customers, Fitbit remains dominant.“Fitbit has taken share this year as Jawbone dropped the ball,” he says, referring to the latter’s five-month delays in launching its latest UP3 tracker. “Fitbit has been very good at broadening their portfolio of devices.”On the other hand, analysts at NPD predict that sales of activity trackers will peak at 32m devices in the US next year.“In the short term, Fitbit can say they have health data that other people don’t have,” says Ms Ask at Forrester. “But nobody knows yet if these fitness wearables are sustainable or go the way of low-end digital cameras.”The shining examples of GoPro action cameras and Beats headphones, which have carved out profitable niches despite every mobile phone coming with a camera and a set of earbuds, show that not all consumer electronics categories have been gobbled up by the smartphone.The Fitbit name has become synonymous with fitness-tracking wristbands.Continue readingThe big question for Fitbit is whether its devices can prove as useful as GoPro or as stylish as Beats, to ensure customers keep using them and upgrade as technology for features such as heart-rate scanning and GPS run tracking improves.Mr Dawson says the company’s prospectus’s report of registered and active customer numbers suggests that “very few of Fitbit’s users have ever purchased more than one device”, despite significant upgrades to the trackers in recent months, and that “half of those who bought one stop using it after a period of time”.If customers are not seeing their health improve by using its products, Fitbit may not go the distance.“Once Fitbit maxes out its addressable market, it’s going to have a really tough time continuing to grow sales,” Mr Dawson said in a note after the IPO filing was lodged. “This, taken together with the threat of Chinese vendors invading the space with much cheaper devices, reinforces my perception that Fitbit is IPOing at the best possible time from the perspective of its existing owners and investors, but that its future looks much less rosy than its past.”
196;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-08T21:36:59Z;Nike promises more US investment and jobs to back Obama on TPP;Footwear maker pledges to add 10,000 new jobs over decade in US in return for fast-track approval;President Barack Obama on Friday took his case for a wide-reaching Pacific Rim trade deal to Oregon where he stressed at Nike headquarters that the US must make sure it did not allow China to write the rules of global trade.The president was visiting Nike on a campaign to build support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as he presses Congress to give him the “fast-track” powers required to close the 12-country trade and investment deal.Mr Obama pushed back against critics of the TPP, saying he disagreed with people who said America should not engage countries with unfair trade rules.“We have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy and we should do it today while our economy is in a position of global strength,” Mr Obama said. “If we don’t write the rules for trade around the world, guess what, China will. And they’ll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers and Chinese businesses the upper hand.”Critics lashed out at Mr Obama’s visit to Nike, claiming the Oregon-based footwear company symbolises the worst of globalisation and US trade policy. Nike mostly manufactures overseas and has previously been criticised for labour and human rights violations by some of its suppliers. Workers at a big Nike supplier called Yue Yuen in China went on strike over pension plans last year, in what was the biggest labour dispute in the country in decades.In a bid to counter that criticism and boost the case for the TPP, Nike unveiled plans ahead of Mr Obama’s visit to expand manufacturing operations in the US if the trade push succeeds.Nike vowed to accelerate plans to expand “advanced footwear manufacturing” in the US if Congress gave Mr Obama “ fast-track” authority to close negotiations with Japan and 10 other economies. That move, it said, would create 10,000 new manufacturing and engineering jobs in the US over the next decade and as many as 40,000 others in related industries.Mark Palmer, Nike chief executive, said the company believed that “agreements that encourage free and fair trade allow Nike to do what we do best: innovate, expand our businesses and drive economic growth”.Nike employs 26,000 people in the US and manufactures soles for trainers in Oregon and Missouri. It said the 10,000 jobs would be created by Nike and its suppliers. The company said the capital for the new investment would come from the benefits of lower tariffs secured via the TPP.“We are a global company and we pay duties around the world. Lowering duties frees up capital to invest and innovate. When we invest and innovate we create jobs,” a Nike spokesman said.The move comes ahead of what are expected to be divisive votes on trade in the coming days in Congress where many of Mr Obama’s Democrats are opposing his push for the TPP and fast-track authority.Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader in the senate, on Thursday moved to schedule a vote as soon as Tuesday on what is formally called Trade Promotion Authority, setting up a clash with Democrats who have vowed to try to block the bill.The House of Representatives is likely to follow with a vote shortly afterwards. But there too Mr Obama is relying on Republican support with the vast majority of Democrats likely to vote against the bill.Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, criticised both Mr Obama and Nike over its announcement.“The American jobs Nike claims it aims to create are a drop in the bucket compared to the massive number of jobs that would be lost nationwide if the TPP is enacted because it gives companies incentives to offshore,” Public Citizen said in a statement. “It’s like saying let’s take one step forward, and 10,000 steps back.”
197;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-06T11:33:53Z;Puma warns of hit from strong dollar;German sportswear group reports sharp rise in first-quarter sales;Shares in Puma fell 7.2 per cent in early trading before regaining ground, after the world’s third largest sportswear group said that the strong dollar would lead to a steep decline in profits this year.The German group, which sponsors Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, sources most of its products in Asia in contracts paid in dollars, but generates a sizeable portion of its revenues in other currencies.As a result of the appreciation of the dollar against most other currencies, Puma said that it now expected its operating profit to be between €80m and €100m this year. In 2014, it posted earnings of €128m.However, the sportswear group stuck by its prediction that sales would grow at a mid single-digit rate, once currency effects had been factored out.Majority-owned by French luxury group Kering, Puma is a distant third behind rivals Nike and Adidas in sports clothing. It is trying to overhaul its brand reputation after an unsuccessful foray into fashion sportswear.The company is focused on developing more innovative sports products, improving the way its goods are marketed in stores and increasing its appeal to female customers — to which end it signed pop star Rihanna as a creative director last year.It is also spending heavily on marketing, and last year struck its largest-ever kit sponsorship deal, with Arsenal football club in London.Bjørn Gulden, chief executive since 2013, told reporters that the currency setback did not change the group’s strategy, which he felt was taking Puma in the right direction. “We are in a turnaround phase,” he said, adding that the process was a “marathon, not a sprint”.The profit warning overshadowed a sharp increase in Puma’s first-quarter sales, which came in at €821m, 13 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Stripping out the impact of currency moves, sales were up 4.4 per cent. Operating profit came in at €38m, down from €58.6m a year earlier.The strongest growth came in footwear sales, which rose 7.8 per cent on a currency-neutral basis, helped by the launch of Puma’s new “Ignite” running shoe in mid February.“We are working very hard to improve our product offer, and although we know we have some ways to go, we feel that this growth in footwear confirms that we are on the right path,” said Mr Gulden.Shares in Puma were down 1.7 per cent at €178.05 in midday trading in Frankfurt.
198;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-05T09:55:59Z;Adidas sales rise marks start of campaign to close gap with Nike;Euro’s weakness against dollar and renminbi bolsters improvements in US and China;Adidas sales rose 17 per cent in the first three months of the year, as it reported its first results since unveiling a five-year strategy designed to close the gap on arch-rival Nike.In the three months to the end of March, the world’s second largest sportswear group by sales posted revenues of €4.08bn, up from €3.48bn a year earlier. Analysts had forecast €3.91bn according to a Reuters poll.The pick-up in sales was driven by an improvement in Adidas’s underperforming US business, and strong growth in China, with sales rising 28 per cent and 44 per cent in the regions respectively.However, the euro’s weakness also played a role in the increases. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, sales in the US were up 7 per cent, and sales in China were up 21 per cent. Group sales were up 9 per cent on the same basis. Net income rose 8 per cent to €221m — or €1.15 per share.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said that the results showed that Adidas had “[got] off the starting block well” and added that he was optimistic about the German group’s prospects for the full year.At a strategy presentation in March, Adidas said that it aimed to boost its annual revenues by almost 50 per cent to more than €22bn by 2020, as well as double its net profits over the same period.The new plan is an effort by the group to revive its fortunes after a difficult 18 months, in which it was forced to issue two profit warnings and abandon a previous set of financial goals.Adidas also lost its number two position in the crucial US market to US brand Under Armour, a setback that Mr Hainer conceded in March was a result of Adidas being “too static and not agile enough”.Mr Hainer struck a cautious note on the group’s business in Russia, where sales fell 3 per cent in the first quarter amid a decline in the value of the rouble and fragile consumer confidence.However, Adidas reiterated that it expects overall sales to grow at “mid-single-digit” rates this year, thanks to rising consumer confidence in most other regions, as well as continuing support from the weakness of the euro, in particular against the renminbi and the dollar.Shares in Adidas were up 2.1 per cent at €77.19 in afternoon trading in Frankfurt.
199;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-05-01T03:09:59Z;Money shower to rain down on Mayweather-Pacquiao fight night;From $2.25m shorts to a gold-embedded mouthguard, Saturday’s bout means big bucks;When he steps into the boxing ring on Saturday night, Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao will be wearing shorts worth $2.25m, carrying the logos of six companies.His opponent, Floyd “Money” Mayweather has struggled to match Pacquiao’s sponsorship deals because of his criminal record, but the undefeated fighter has boasted of his $25,000 mouthguard, embedded with diamonds, gold and shreds of $100 bills.The fans in MGM Grand in Las Vegas will have paid up to $100,000 each for their seats after frenzied bidding on the black market — of the 16,800 tickets in the arena, only 500 were sold publicly.The fight, five years in the making, is being billed as one of the richest ever sporting events. It brings together for the first time the two men considered the best pound-for-pound boxers on the planet — Mayweather from the US and Pacquiao from the Philippines — who will fight to be the uncontested world welterweight champion.Barring a rematch, it is the last titanic boxing match on the horizon. No sporting event in history can match it, dollar for dollar, minute by minute. The bout is worth between $400m and $500m for a maximum of 12 rounds of boxing — 36 minutes in total. It has smashed all records for sponsorship, box-office sales and pay-per-view fees.“I have never seen anything like it. It is a natural phenomenon. You can’t pay money for this kind of promotion,” says Fred Sternburg, a spokesman for Top Rank, Pacquiao’s promoter. “The biggest winner is going to be the taxman. These two will pay enough taxes to fund a small war.”But it could have been even more lucrative, as the two sides scrambled against time to cut deals.“We were only told this fight was going to happen eight weeks ago,” says Lucia McKelvey, who marketed the fight to corporate sponsors and also handled Pacquiao’s personal deals. “Normally we have six months!”Heavyweight corporate sponsors, the top-tier companies that stump up millions for the Super Bowl or the World Cup, had already allocated their funds for the year.“A lot of the marketing budgets are designated in November for the following year,” Ms McKelvey says. “There was strong interest, but I got some pushback. They said they loved the match but they had already allocated their dollars, and this was expensive.”In the end, she raised $13.2m from five sponsors. Tecate, the Mexican beer brand owned by Heineken, paid $5.6m to place its logo on the floor of the ring.I have never seen anything like it. It is a natural phenomenon. You can’t pay money for this kind of promotionThen Ms McKelvey turned to Hollywood, offering film studios with upcoming blockbusters the chance to embed their trailers in the pay-per-view broadcast.“We went after two things, companies that wanted to promote immediate events, and companies that make sense to boxing and sports fans,” she says. So the trailers for the new Terminator and Mission Impossible movies will be shown, along with Southpaw, the upcoming boxing movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal.But with viewers paying between $90 and $100 to watch the broadcast, advertisements were banned in case they rankled the audience. “I would have liked to sell them,” says Ms McKelvey. “Everyone would buy it anyway. There are people who tune into the Super Bowl just for the commercials.”When it came to personal sponsorship, Mayweather’s two convictions for domestic violence make him a difficult sell. “If he was just putting on an act of being bad, that’s one thing, but he really is nasty and companies do not feel safe with that,” says one person involved in the commercial side of the fight, who asked not to be named.Ms McKelvey says she had pitched Mayweather a joint deal with Pacquiao for a large pizza company, but was rebuffed. In the end, Mayweather signed a “low-seven-figure” deal to wear the logo of FanDuel, an online one-day fantasy league organiser.“He has never sold the rights to his trunks before,” says Justine Sacco, a spokesman for FanDuel. “As well as exposure, we got six backstage packages. This is about telling people that this is the sort of event we can give you.” She says 213,000 people had signed up, at $2 each, for a chance to win.60/40Split of purse estimated to exceed $300m, in favour of MayweatherBoth boxers are close to the end of their careers, and Ms Sacco says that has magnified the appeal of the contest. But Ms McKelvey says brands prefer long-term endorsements, so it was harder to convince them to pay large sums for an athlete who might only fight a few times again, if at all.Pacquiao, a congressman in the Philippines, is nevertheless a draw. Along with fitting six logos on his shorts, he has signed $8m of deals with Nike, Foot Locker, Wonderful Pistachios, Nestlé and Samsung.Both men will walk away with more than $100m, but the split is 60/40 in favour of Mayweather, who taunted his rival about money earlier in the week.Away from the ring in Las Vegas, critics have complained that the high price of the television feed will ultimately cost boxing its grassroots audience.Last Saturday, current heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko failed to sell out his title fight at Madison Square Garden. Younger audiences have flocked to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).But Frank Warren, the promoter, says boxing is “on a high”.“The sport is getting the most out of modern technology with pay-per-view,” he says. “UFC has a totally different audience.”“With events in different eras, you had a challenge reaching the public,” says Bob Arum, 83, chief executive of Pacqiao’s promoter Top Rank. “Now with social media you can do it instantaneously,” he says. “Who knows what technology we will have in five to 10 years time?”He adds: “You cannot say this will be the biggest or the best. Great fighters will come along again.”
200;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-04-19T12:57:50Z;Sport England and Nike take different tacks to get women active;Two big campaigns differ in approach to encourage female participation in sport;There is more than a whiff of paternalism about two big campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic to encourage more women into sports.In the UK, Sport England’s much-praised #thisgirlcan advert — which has been viewed more than 13m times online — revolves around the astounding fact that exercise often involves getting out of breath.And this week sportswear giant Nike has launched a somewhat suspiciously similar campaign in the US, #betterforit, which has the equally profound message that you need to practise to get better at sports.However sceptical you are about the campaigns’ concepts, it is worth thinking about how infrequently billboards — let alone TVs — around the country are filled with pictures of women actively doing sport.A glance at the upcoming UK sporting schedules for the next couple of weeks shows that aside from the London marathon, the next sight of elite female athletes in most British households will not be until the Badminton horse trials in May.While equestrianism is one of the few sports in which women compete alongside men at a world-class level, the requirement to have a horse to compete puts participation beyond the means of many.Men looking for role models or inspiration to get off the couch have a far wider diet. Football, cricket, snooker, motorsport, cycling and rugby union — sports showcasing a huge array of male physiques and talent — will all be beamed into British living rooms over the next few weeks.If you are a woman — or a young girl — what do you have? Perhaps the most visible British female athlete is Olympic gold medal winner Jessica Ennis, an image of veritable — and unobtainable — physical perfection. Even she is more often seen on billboards advertising products, rather than plying her trade.Or you have champions in sports that require access to substantial kit, like a horse or a boat which, despite notable efforts from sporting bodies to widen their appeal, are still mainly the preserve of the middle classes.Figures from the Sutton Trust also show that of the British women who won medals at the 2012 London Olympics, 46.5 per cent attended selective schools — either fee paying or grammar — but only about 7 per cent of the population are educated privately.Sport England will get its first hint of whether its campaign has had any impact in the real world in June, when the next set of numbers on how many Britons participate in sports are published.It currently estimates 2m fewer 14 to 40-year-old women than men play sport regularly in the UK — despite 75 per cent saying they want to be more active.Nike, after all, is not spending big money on a new advertising campaign for altruistic reasons: it is betting that it can grow its womenswear line from $5bn a year at present to $7bn by 2017.This is where the differences between the two campaigns start to grate. The Sport England campaign deliberately casts non-models and features an array of accessible sports from boxing to football on an urban artificial pitch and swimming in an ordinary municipal swimming pool.The Nike campaign by contrast remains focused on the body beautiful, and far more traditional female activities like yoga, running and studio cycling.One particularly jarring clip, entitled “Inner Thoughts”, shows a woman admitting being intimidated by the presence of models in her spin class. There is no noticeable difference in physique between her and them.But, in the end, the more women are encouraged to do a wider range of sports, the better. Not just for the nation’s health — and goodness knows we all need to be fitter — but for its sporting future. Talent, the real talent that wins medals, does not have to come from the playing fields of elite schools.British Cycling has proved that participation and elite success do go hand in hand: 15 per cent more women now cycle recreationally once a week than four years ago, while its women’s team continues to break records and win medals — and hails mainly from state school backgrounds.Many years ago, I was one of a group of children running around on a rundown, sloping, plastic, all-weather tennis court — the type of venue that would give elite coaches kittens — ineffectively trying to hit a hockey ball.Sporting wise, most of us never amounted to much, but fast-forward 20 years and I had the great privilege to be in the stadium when one of those scabby-kneed children won a bronze medal with the Great Britain’s women’s hockey team. You never know where that future talent may come from.
201;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-04-02T17:08:32Z;The footsy index: how sneakers became very big business;Meet the sneakerheads who spent $1bn last year in their hunt for ‘kicks’ on the resale market;"In a brick-lined first-floor converted apartment on Lenox Avenue in Harlem, the father-and-son duo of Troy and Chase Reed spend their days helping young New Yorkers overcome cash flow problems. While they’re not exactly a charitable concern, the Reeds’ pawnshop has become a pocket-lining oasis for the young and hard-up whose assets come laced-up and box-fresh — sneakers.For the Reeds, Sneaker Pawn USA sprouted from a common patriarchal dilemma: the constant doling out of cash to a teenage son. The solution was to appropriate the newest pair of Chase’s sneakers and return them only when the loan had been paid off. “Then my son started showing me these pictures of people’s collections on Instagram and I was in amazement,” says Troy.“I asked my son ‘Do you think these kids own all these sneakers?’ and he said ‘Yeah dad, these are people’s sneaker closets.’ So I thought if my son doesn’t have money, imagine how many other kids don’t have money but do have sneakers. I knew Sneaker Pawn was going to work the first day we opened, because somebody bought 60 pairs of sneakers. I knew right then and there this idea was a no-brainer.”The sneaker market as we know it today was born in the early 1980s when sportswear and hip-hop culture were conjoined with two momentous events: hip-hop group Run DMC’s release of “My Adidas” and their subsequent branding by the firm from Herzogenaurach; and the arrival of basketball legend Michael Jordan’s signature Nike Air Jordan 1. Together they catalysed a street style that young people across the world could reference.“We don’t have the total international sneaker market figures today but the NPD consumer panel data shows the US retail sneaker market is alone worth approximately $28bn,” says Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the market researcher group, and author of the Sneakernomics blog at Forbes. According to figures from sports industry news site SportsOneSource, the international market has grown by more than 40% since 2004 and is estimated to be worth in the region of $55bn a year, or about the GDP of Kenya.“Sneakers are a part of the fabric of society,” says Kish Kash, a London-based hip-hop DJ and trainer collector. “I don’t know how many pairs I own — I stopped counting at about 2,000. I’m sure there are people out there with more, but it’s not how many you’ve got, it’s what you’ve got.”Or rather, what others want. To the uninitiated, the sneaker world can seem as closed and elitist as the fashion industry, followed with unabated fervour by the few (for “fashionistas” read “sneakerheads”); the rest of us are happy to consume new styles and trends at a more negotiable pace. Where the two markets diverge however, is in exclusivity. Yes, high-end fashion is exclusive . . . but you’ll never see round-the-block crowds camping outside of a Gucci or Prada store waiting to get their hands on the new season’s designs.“The main sports brands have long since known that with credible collaborations and limited releases, they can generate unrequited demand to drive up hype and support future sales,” explains Powell. When it comes to sneakers, hype drives the halo effect — it’s self-sustaining marketing at its best.For sneakerheads, missing out on a limited edition collaboration means looking for the same “kicks” on a resale market where the mark-ups are astounding. Want a pair of 2014 Nike Air Yeezy 2 “Red Octobers” as designed by rapper Kanye West? That’ll be $5,000. Or perhaps a pair of 2005 Nike Air Jordan IV Retro Eminem Slim Shadys? They are on sale on eBay for $26,000.“In the last couple of years the sneaker world has gone pretty nuts,” says Fraser Cooke, who heads up the Global Energy marketing division at Nike, overseeing the brand’s many high-profile partnerships, including an overhaul of the Nike Air Force with the Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, and most recently a collaboration with the Japanese brand Sacai. “The original architecture of this culture, pre-internet, was more stylistically driven than it is today. For us it was all about style first — rarity and exclusivity wasn’t really interesting back then.”The resale market is now estimated to be valued at $1bn. “On the surface, the secondary market may look like a stock market but it’s more similar to the illegal drug trade,” says Josh Luber, the 37-year-old IBM strategy consultant, collector and self-professed data nerd behind campless.com, a site that analyses over 19 million eBay auctions, collecting sneaker data on price, volatility, resell premium, market availability and deadstock percentage. Deadstock describes an immaculate unworn shoe with the laces still in the factory configuration and the box and internal tissue paper untainted. One collector told me that dedicated collectors will often buy two pairs of the same release: “One to rock and one to stock.”$55bnThe global sneaker market is the same as the GDP of KenyaIn a survey Luber conducted into the profiles of collectors, he found that around a third had never sold a pair and another third would only occasionally sell a pair to fund a new purchase; a mere 5% are in it solely to make a profit — all of which suggests that Moody’s won’t be lifting sneakers to investment grade any time soon. Nevertheless, as today’s sneaker-collecting teenager becomes tomorrow’s sneaker-collecting twenty-something with his own disposable income, resale prices will continue to increase, especially if Nike and others continue with the same limited-release strategy.“The fundamental way to win in the secondary market is to be able to buy the sneakers, especially limited edition ones, at the retail price, which is a monumental challenge for a lot of reasons,” says Luber. “You either need to be prepared to camp out at stores, or you need smart computer programmes that will buy online before anyone else.” For example, Nike’s Air Yeezy 2 “Red October” sneakers designed by Kanye West sold out in 10 minutes online. As for camp-outs, retailers try to limit them by using a raffle ticket system instead. While that doesn’t reward those with patience, it does protect them. A number of Nike releases have turned violent in recent years, with riots, fights and attempted looting. When Nike released its Lebron X “Denim” in 2013, a customer waiting in line outside Atlanta’s Wish boutique shot dead another man attempting to rob lucky customers as they left the store.Husband and wife team Nathan and Elisha Massiah, otherwise known as Fresh Laces (freshlaces.co.uk), offer to do the hard yards for you. Just recently they installed a boutique in Harvey Nichols in London where they sell extremely rare and sought-after sneakers they’ve sourced from around the world. The success of their venture is indicative of the current crossover between street culture and high-end fashion.“Some of the designers who have started to take over these big luxury fashion houses grew up with street style,” says Cooke. “I worked on the Riccardo Tisci project, for example, and Riccardo loves that shoe, he’s been wearing it for the last 10 years. He’s had a long and genuine affiliation with Nike. It’s that kind of credibility which makes a collaboration really great.”While scarcity accounts for much of the inflated prices in the secondary market, the credibility that Cooke speaks of is everything, especially given the high frequency of collaborations. But as Luber points out, credibility is anything with a Nike swoosh on it: “96% of the eBay sneakerhead market last year was Nike and Jordans. In 2013, $62.7 million was spent on eBay just on Jordans 3 through 14 alone. Sneakerheads joke that it doesn’t matter what the shoe is — as long as it’s limited and Nike, they will buy it.”That dynamic might soon change. Kanye West — the only name in the sneaker market with the customer appeal to challenge Michael Jordan’s dominance — has left Nike for nearest rival Adidas for a rumoured $10m deal plus royalties. The music star severed his ties with Nike after seven years and two shoes, in late 2013, stating that his contract fell through because they wouldn’t offer him sufficient royalties.West’s Adidas Yeezy Boost sneakers (he even took the Yeezy name with him) were available on the secondary market in February at an average of $1,573, a 450% mark-up on the retail price (and that despite a further limited release across Europe on Thursday this week, exclusive to six European Footlocker stores and online). Perhaps more revealing about Adidas’s strategy is its recent unveiling of Confirmed, an app that will allow users to reserve limited edition items on a first-click-first-serve basis. Having recently suffered a slump in profits, the Yeezy effect can’t come soon enough.The dynamics of how limited sneakers are released varies but most occur on a Saturday morning, with many drops requiring in-store registration the day before. “Outside of its biggest stores such as Nike Town on Oxford Street, Nike designate certain sneaker boutiques with various levels of status,” says Massiah. There are only five Tier Zero boutiques [the highest], in the UK, and they are given limited numbers of the biggest releases. However, in February alone this year there were 188 sneaker releases documented on solecollector.com, begging the question, isn’t there a risk that a market dominated by one brand is being primed for a pop?“We’re at a pretty interesting inflection point in the secondary market right now,” says Luber. “In 2012-13, month-on-month growth in dollar terms was over 60%, it was just crazy. But last January and February were the first two negative months of growth in the three years we’ve been tracking the resale market.”If the sheer frequency of new releases becomes an Achilles heel, then China could be the corrective insole. An estimated 300 million people in China play basketball but Mike Powell puts the sneaker business there at only 20-25% of the size of the US business. With a population four times that of the US, an ever-expanding middle class, and a growing number of Chinese NBA stars, Powell thinks it is reasonable to expect that China’s sales will eventually overtake the US and who knows what the resale market will look like then.“I know one thing for sure,” says Massiah. “There will always be sneakerheads looking to feed their habit.”Photographs: Corbis; Jonathan Elderfield; 2015 Paras Griffin; Globe Photos; 1989 Amblin Entertainment"
202;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-03-20T16:50:05Z;Nike leaps on higher sales and future orders;But strong dollar hurts results because of effect on value of European sales;Better than expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and future orders lifted Nike shares on Friday.Goods for delivery between March and July rose 11 per cent in constant currencies buoyed by the trend among US consumers to wear athletic apparel outside the gym.Wall Street analysts had forecast that the measure, a leading indicator of the company’s future results, would advance 9.9 per cent. Including currency changes, however, reported orders climbed 2 per cent.For the three months to the end of February Nike reported profits of $791m, or 89 cents per share, compared with $682m, or 75 cents a share. Sales climbed 7 per cent to $7.5bn.Analysts on Wall Street expected the athletic apparel and footwear maker to report earnings of 84 cents a share, on sales of $7.6bn.Sales in the US — which accounted for 47 per cent of revenues last year — rose 6 per cent from a year earlier to $3.3bn. Future sales orders for the region advanced 15 per cent, ahead of expectations for an 11.5 per cent rise.Dollar strength hurt the results, however, as Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, said the value of its sales in Europe would have increased 21 per cent, rather than the 10 per cent it reported, had it not been for the dollar’s rise against the euro.“We are encouraged to see Nike deliver more than 14 per cent earnings before interest and tax growth in its core Nike brand business in the face of significant currency headwinds, choppy consumer trends in key markets (Brazil, China, Japan, eastern Europe) and the sustained period of strength in North America, where the brand is most mature,” said Lindsay Drucker Mann, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Shares of Nike, which have climbed 29 per cent in the past year, gained 3.7 per cent to $101.98.Biogen was the best performer on the benchmark S&P 500, after a study showed that its Alzheimer’s drug, Aducanumab, slowed a patient’s cognitive decline with a statistically significant reduction in the build-up of amyloid plaque, believed to play a key role in the development of symptoms.Shares in Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, climbed nearly 10 per cent to $475.98.Tiffany shares fell 4 per cent to $82.93, after the luxury retailer said it expected a 30 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings and “a more modest decline in the second quarter”.The warning accompanied fourth-quarter profits that topped forecasts. Tiffany reported earnings of $196.2m, or $1.51 a share, on sales of $1.29bn. Wall Street had estimated earnings of $1.50 a share on sales of $1.3bn.“Longer term, we believe Tiffany’s growth prospects are favourable given its dominant position in the global luxury category and global diversification,” said Randall J Konik, an analyst at Jefferies. “However, there will probably be some volatility in fundamental performance in the near term due to global economic uncertainty and a strong US dollar.”US stocks rallied as the dollar weakened and the Nasdaq Composite approached a record closing high.The S&P 500 gained 0.9 per cent to 2,108.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 18,127.65, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 5,026.42.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
203;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-03-18T09:30:56Z;Chinese factory workers strike over benefits;Protests rise in China as labour relations grow increasingly fractious amid slowing economy;Thousands of workers have downed tools at the shoemaking factory that last year suffered one of the biggest strikes in China’s modern history, as labour relations grow increasingly fractious amid the slowing economy.Millions of migrant women — and men— provided the muscle behind China’s export-driven economic rise. But protests are rising as the balance of power slowly shifts from employers to workers because of demographic and technological trends.Workers and labour rights groups said at least 3,000 workers went on strike at Yue Yuen Industrial, a Taiwanese shoe manufacturer for the likes of Nike and Adidas, after management announced plans to merge two production operations.Last year tens of thousands of workers at Yue Yuen’s facilities in Dongguan, a manufacturing centre in southern Guangdong province, took to the streets after alleging their employer had not been making pension payments.The industrial action, which led to brief clashes with local police, ended after Yue Yuen agreed to make back-payments.“With the transformation of manufacturing, a lot of problems affecting workers’ social security and other benefits have accumulated,” said Pang Kun, a labour lawyer. “There will be more strikes such as this.”The latest wave is also ensnaring Chinese authorities as workers demand access to social welfare funds that local governments — many of which are themselves cash-strapped — cannot afford to release.In a notice obtained by China Labor Watch, a New York-based group, Yue Yuen said the merger of the two plants would only affect clerical and logistics staff, and not assembly-line personnel.The workers, however, fear it could be a prelude to lay-offs if the company relocates operations to cheaper locations in China’s interior or to other countries in Southeast Asia.They demanded the immediate release of money they have accrued under a “housing fund” — allowances required under Chinese law, which can range from 5 per cent to 20 per cent of workers’ monthly incomes.Dongguan recently moved to restrict the circumstances under which workers may draw down their housing funds, sparking a 5,000-strong strike at another factory in the area last week.“We are at the factory today but nobody is doing any work,” said one Yue Yuen employee, who asked not to be identified. “Our main request is to be able to withdraw our housing fund freely. If the merger goes ahead, then we also want severance.”Jerry Shum, head of investor relations for Yue Yuen, said the strike involved less than five per cent of the company’s China workforce and would not have a material impact on its operations.Late last year, similar concerns sparked a wave of school strikes in northeastern Heilongjiang province involving as many as 20,000 teachers.Workers’ increasing fixation on social security and other welfare benefits has opened a new front in China’s rapidly evolving labour movement, threatening to wreck a nine-month detente with authorities across the country.After a series of industrial actions erupted at high-profile employers such as Walmart and IBM in the first half of 2014, local authorities did not arrest labour leaders so long as they did not “disrupt social order” by leading strikes that spilled beyond their company’s premises.Additional reporting by Wan Li
204;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-03-15T18:02:17Z;Week ahead: Fed looms large;UK Budget, Israeli election and Iran talks expected to dominate the week;"The US Federal Reserve looms large over a busy week ahead.Investors will be scrutinising the next statement from the Federal Reserve as debate rages over when the central bank will raise rates. While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time. The consistent buying of stock by US corporates reached $553.2bn in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones indices.Financials staved off losses recorded by much of the broader market after the Fed did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks. The approved programmes include double-digit dividend increases at Morgan Stanley, Discover Financial and Capital One.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
205;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;China shoe factory strike highlights benefit fears;Workers launch industrial action over housing allowance payments;Workers at one of China’s largest shoe manufacturers have gone on strike in a dispute over housing fund payments, highlighting the increasing focus of the country’s ageing workforce on the protection of social security and other benefits.The strike at a factory employing about 5,000 people that is owned by Stella International Holdings, which supplies Nike, Timberland and other international brands, erupted on Sunday after local government officials in the southern province of Guangdong issued new regulations governing worker drawdowns of housing funds.According to workers and labour rights activists the factory in the manufacturing centre of Dongguan failed to pay the housing allowance required under Chinese law, which can range from 5 per cent to 20 per cent of workers’ monthly incomes.Dongguan’s new policy, which came into effect on March 1, limits the circumstances in which workers can access the funds and restricts use of the money to local properties. Workers would prefer to use the money to buy or build much cheaper properties in their rural hometowns.One worker who asked to be identified only by his surname, Li, said Stella only started paying into his housing fund last month.“The factory promised me they would start payments last year, but only started last month and then the policy was changed,” said Mr Li, who hails from central Hubei province and has worked at Stella for five years. “I’ve never considered buying a property in Dongguan. It’s an impossible dream for me.”Stella said only a few hundred workers had demonstrated and most were back at work by Wednesday morning. It declined to comment further.Last year tens of thousands of workers at another Dongguan shoe factory, Yue Yuen, went on strike over pension payments, drawing international attention to Chinese workers’ growing concern over the integrity of their benefits as well as wages. Local government officials eventually forced the Taiwanese company to top up the workers’ pension funds.“After that protest [at Yue Yuen], workers have gone on strike more frequently,” said Zhang Zhiru, head of a local labour rights group. “They don’t want to waste time on negotiations that can take a long time and are usually useless.”We are only asking for what we deserve and is guaranteed by the law. What’s wrong with that?A series of teacher strikes, also over pensions, erupted later in the year in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, China’s human resources minister said the government faced “great pressure” to balance pension fund cash flows.“We have taken a very cautious investment approach,” Yin Weimin said. “As a result, pension fund returns have been lower than consumer inflation.” Mr Yin added that the percentage of China’s population aged 60 or above would more than triple to 39 per cent by 2050.Mr Li and three other workers at Stella said the local government had dispatched police to end the strike, leading to clashes. They added that on Monday, most of the factory’s workers joined what had begun as a small protest.The Dongguan local government could not be reached for comment.The workers insisted their demands were reasonable.“We are only asking for what we deserve and is guaranteed by the law,” said one, Ms Liu, who has worked at the factory for eight years. “What’s wrong with that?”Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Beijing
206;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-02-16T13:04:44Z;Puma asks for patience over turnround;Sports brand lifts fourth-quarter sales by 7.5 per cent to €751m;Puma, the German sports brand that sponsors sprinter Usain Bolt and last year signed pop star Rihanna as a creative director, is asking for patience as it tries to emulate its brand ambassadors’ global success.Bjørn Gulden, chief executive since 2013, described last year’s performance as a “turning point,” but acknowledged that the brand’s transformation would still “take time” to complete.“You cannot turn round a company in 12 months,” he said, noting that Puma had halted a slide in sales and launched more competitive products.The company struck its largest-ever kit sponsorship deal with Arsenal football club last year. Puma’s shares have declined 17 per cent over the past 12 months and in Monday trading slipped 0.2 per cent to €178.60.Full-year net profit jumped from €5m to €64m, thanks to the absence of one-off costs that weighed on Puma’s 2013 results. Total revenues were broadly flat at €3bn, but rose 3.3 per cent when adjusted for the impact of currency swings. The company is proposing a €0.50 a share dividend, the same as a year ago.Majority owned by French luxury group Kering, Puma is trying to overhaul its brand reputation after an unsuccessful foray into fashion sportswear.The company is focused on developing more innovative sports products, improving the way its goods are marketed in stores and increasing its appeal to female customers — hence the tie-up with Rihanna.But Puma, which is 66 years old and ranks a distant third in sporting goods sales behind Nike and Adidas, is facing an increasingly competitive industry, influenced by younger brands including Under Armour.Puma’s fourth-quarter sales rose 7.5 per cent to €751m, compared with the same quarter a year ago. However, this growth was partly offset by higher operating expenses, including a big investment in its “Forever Faster” marketing campaign.Andreas Riemann, analyst at Commerzbank, said Puma’s growth was coming “at a very high cost”.Fluctuating global currencies weighed on earnings in the latest quarter and could have a “significant negative impact” on earnings in 2015, Puma warned.The German group highlighted the recent strengthening of the US dollar. Its biggest procurement market is Asia, where most payments are settled in US dollars.Its fourth-quarter €5m net loss was an improvement on the €115m net loss generated a year ago.In 2015, sales are expected to increase by a currency-adjusted “medium” single-digit percentage, while net earnings are expected to rise slightly.
207;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-02-06T17:16:08Z;Under Armour: understated;Will software acquisitions really help sell athletic apparel?;"“Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes.” How refreshing, in an age of endless corporate jargon and spin, to see such a clear objective. The words are written on a white board in the office of Kevin Plank, chief executive of sportswear company Under Armour. The exploits of Tom Brady, who won the Super Bowl in Under Armour shoes, will help Mr Plank achieve this aim.He is already doing very nicely. Net revenues rose almost a third last year, and the company has been growing sales by more than 20 per cent for the past 19 consecutive quarters. Its hefty valuation of 70 times forecast earnings rests on the assumption that Mr Plank can keep selling shirts and shoes. Already the number two athletic apparel retailer in the US, behind Nike, Under Armour forecasts sales growth of 22 per cent for the next three years.To reach this, the company is trying to go beyond shirts and shoes — and into the world of data. It wants to know how potential customers eat, sleep and run. So it has been buying up fitness apps: MapMyFitness for $150m in 2013; workout tracker Endomondo for $90m last month; and dieting app MyFitnessPal for nearly half a billion dollars this week. Added up, the amount spent on these deals is more than three times last year’s operating cash flow. Under Armour has also invested in its own workout app, UA Record, launched in January. The company sees these apps as a way to build relationships — and sell more gear. Under Armour is not, however, going as far as Nike by investing in hardware such as wearable fitness trackers. Nike has had some success with its Fuel Band and Nike Plus. Under Armour’s apps are hardware agnostic, working with any device.There are sound reasons for Under Armour to keep investing in software, but the scale of this week’s acquisition is concerning. The beautifully simple statement on the whiteboard suggests that Under Armour is a shirts and shoes company. It should stay that way.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
208;NKE;Nike Inc;2015-02-05T00:35:01Z;Under Armour snaps up fitness apps;American sportswear brand steps up challenge to Nike;Under Armour is paying more than half a billion dollars to acquire two fitness tracking apps in the digital health market’s biggest deals yet, as the American sportswear brand steps up its challenge to Nike.The deals, for MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, follow Under Armour’s $150m purchase in 2013 of MapMyFitness and a new partnership in wearable technology with smartphone maker HTC.They give the sports company a combined digital audience of more than 120m users who have signed up for its health apps over the past few years.The acquisitions come two months ahead of the launch of Apple’s Watch. This will include several fitness-tracking functions, including a Nike app, as the technology and sports industries collide.“With MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world’s largest digital health and fitness community,” said Kevin Plank, Under Armour chief executive. “We believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes, reach more athletes and make them better.”The three apps track daily activity, workouts, nutrition and sleep to provide “the most complete measure of a person’s fitness”, Mr Plank said, creating a “daily dashboard” of health he hopes customers will check as frequently as the weather or their bank balance.Under Armour is paying $475m for San Francisco-based MyFitnessPal, one of the most popular apps for tracking exercise and eating habits, with 80m users signing up since it was launched in 2005. Its calorie counter app is particularly popular with dieters, after founder Mike Lee created the service to lose weight ahead of his wedding.Copenhagen-based Endomondo, whose 20m registered users are mostly in Europe, will help Under Armour to grow its international business, Mr Plank said. The app acts like a virtual personal trainer, tracking running or cycling using a smartphone’s GPS and comparing a user’s workouts with their friends’.The two deals will boost Under Armour’s revenues in 2015, offsetting an anticipated 1 percentage point impact on sales growth from the weak dollar. However, the acquired companies’ operating losses and related investments caused Under Armour to lower its guidance for operating income growth for the year from 22 per cent to around 15 per cent.. . . We now have the world’s largest digital health and fitness community. We believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes, reach more athletes and make them betterBoth apps will remain as standalone services, grouped under its “connected fitness” branding. Their audiences compare with around 25m users for the Nike+ digital community, according to comments from the sports brand’s chief executive last October. While no active user figures were given for the acquired services, Mr Plank said that 4.2m people had signed up for the three apps in January alone, logging 100m workouts.“Our goal in aggregating these three platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand,” Mr Plank said on a conference call with analysts. “Our consumer is demanding more from athletic brands than just making shirts and shoes …This will help drive our core business.”He said the apps would remain available across a wide range of devices as Under Armour takes a “device agnostic” approach to wearable technology.The company reported revenue growth of 31 per cent to $895.2m for its fourth quarter, with net income up 37 per cent to $87.7m in the three months ending in December. Under Armour’s sponsored athletes include Tom Brady, the NFL quarterback with the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, and his wife, the model Gisele Bündchen, as well as British tennis player Andy Murray.John Doerr, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which alongside Accel invested $18m in MyFitnessPal in 2013, said that it was the “largest health and fitness app in the world, by far” and joining Under Armour would give it an “insurmountable advantage”.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

The world number one golfer clinched his second Dubai Desert Classic at the weekend in the hot and manicured greens of the Gulf. For the next few days, though, his surroundings will be chilly Dublin, and the grand if rather grey interior of the Irish High Court.Mr McIlroy, the 25 year-old Northern Irishman who has replaced Tiger Woods as the golfing world’s superstar, has had a bitter falling-out with Horizon Sports Management, his former agents. He joined them in late 2011, and walked away 18 months later, arguing that the terms of his contract were “unconscionable”, and took unfair advantage of his youth and naivety.He is suing Horizon in the High Court, claiming among other things that his contract compared unfavourably with others in their stable, including his friend and fellow Northern Irish golf champion, Graeme McDowell. Horizon is counter-claiming for unpaid commissions and fees. Attempts at arbitration, encouraged by an Irish judge, have failed, and the case is due to begin on Tuesday, barring a last-minute settlement.It is a legal showdown the sedate world of golf wishes was not happening. It offers the rare prospect of a peek into the finances and perhaps the lifestyle of a sports star. It promises to reveal the secrets of one of the most lucrative sponsorships in professional sport. At stake are the reputations of a popular boy-next-door sportsman, and a start-up sports agency that was building its business around him.Fallings-out between sports stars and their agents are not uncommon, but they tend to be in the more aggressive arenas of football or boxing. Says Eamon Lynch, editor of Golf.com in New York: “Within the broader golf world there’s a widespread sense of surprise that it hasn’t yet been resolved, mainly because the public airing of grievances is very rare in this game.”The public airing of grievances is very rare in this gameA spokeswoman for Mr McIlroy said he had neither spoken nor given interviews specifically about the court case. However, speaking to golf correspondents in Dubai last week, he betrayed a certain emotion about the weight of it on his shoulders, and about the prospect of taking the witness stand. “I just have to get up there and tell the truth. I mean, that’s all I need to do,” he said.One aspect of the case between Mr McIlroy and Horizon is a sponsorship deal worth a reported $100m that the agency negotiated for its client with Nike. According to one person familiar with the legal case, it may be the third biggest endorsement contract Nike has signed with a sporting figure. Horizon also secured sponsorship deals with Santander, Omega and Bose.The dispute, according to some people familiar with the case, is in part the result of the desire of Mr McIlroy’s entourage, led by his father Gerry, to manage his financial affairs independently now that he has become one of the game’s highest earners. The wonder, they say, is that the publicity it has generated – with more sure to follow – has not affected Mr McIlroy’s game.His three-shot win in Dubai at the weekend was as effortless as usual. Last year he won two “majors”, as the top four competitions in golf are known, and was a key player in the victorious European Ryder Cup team.“Rory hasn’t been around long enough to have anything to hide,” says the golf writer Dermot Gilleece. “The fact that he is prepared to lay everything bare in the courtroom tells me he has nothing to hide.”

We usually start the week saying I’m going to take time off here and here, but things come in.”We are sitting in Ms Ker Conway’s spacious apartment on Boston’s leafy Commonwealth Avenue. Her home since 1992, it also doubles as her office.One of America’s most senior female corporate figures, she has “just gotten off endless boards” — from Nike to the John F Kennedy Library and Boston Museum. But her advanced years have not stopped her joining new ones.Now 80, the long-time feminist has once again turned to activism. She is chairwoman of Community Solutions, a hard-hitting New York-based not-for-profit organisation set up in 2011 to help find permanent housing for homeless people across the US. “It’s very lively and innovative. I’m just so interested in how different groups with different backgrounds go about trying to improve this vast society” she says.“The goal for Community Solutions has been to transform the language in which people talk about the homeless, to develop a sense of respect and change the expectation about what might happen if someone is helped to get shelter.”As well as communications, her role centres on fundraising and running the board. In terms of the latter, the mainly young team could hardly have done better: Ms Ker Conway sat on Nike’s board for 25 years, Colgate-Palmolive’s for 26 and Merrill Lynch’s for nearly 30, among many others.Should there be formal interventions such as quotas to increase the number of women on boards in the US?
No. I don’t think this would work at all in the US. Someone who is plumped onto a board that does not want them will not have a happy and useful role.What are the defining qualities of being Australian?
Australia has several cultures. There is one in which people strive to be solid citizens. The underlying theme is that you are responsible to support your community and people you work with. There isn’t the impersonal tone of most American cities.When did you first become a mentor?
Goodness, I couldn’t begin to say. Teaching has been my life. Anytime I see a teachable moment I go to it.
Which newspapers do you read?
New York Times, Boston Globe and the FT and the New York Review of Books.An academic who specialises in the history of women, Ms Ker Conway began a second career in business after serving as the first woman president of Smith, the US liberal arts college, for 10 years to 1985. Before that, she was vice-president of the University of Toronto, having taught at and earned a PhD from Harvard, where she met her late husband, a Canadian academic.In parallel, she wrote three books of memoirs, the first of which, The Road from Coorain, about growing up on a drought-ridden farm, became a bestseller, turning her into a household name in her native Australia. Her childhood attuned her to climate change: “Growing up in the outback and seeing the terrible destruction of flora and fauna you couldn’t help but be an environmentalist,” she says.Her career has not been without setbacks. The last time we met, in 2000, she was at the peak of her corporate career, also chairing Lend Lease, the Australian property group. Three years later, she resigned after a spate of profit warnings, prompted in part by an unsuccessful move into the US, earning a drubbing in the Australian press.How does she view the episode now?“Everybody has to be able to accept defeat in life and the question is whether you pick yourself up and keep on going and I certainly feel I did,” she says. “I felt I had done a good job for Lend Lease given the major shifts in its plans and commitments. I could have done a better one, but it was an OK job.”Nor did the experience and the subsequent financial crisis turn her off the corporate world. When asked if she prefers working in the not-for-profit sector, she says: “No, not at all. It is very similar in many ways.”In some senses, her work at Community Solutions has brought her full circle. It has once again highlighted the barriers facing women, something she first studied as a graduate student. But she is encouraged by the growing numbers of women working in the federal bureaucracy and the White House.Do women still need role models at the top of political life? Would the election of a woman as president make a difference?“Oh yes,” she says. “ Sexism hasn’t gone away, it’s gone underground. An election of a woman here would be a big plus symbolically for its impact on young people.”——————————————-On the deskAs a champion not only of women’s rights but also of women’s sport, it is fitting that Jill Ker Conway is wearing bright pink Nike trainers for our meeting.Tall and slim, these days arthritis prevents the once keen jogger from running, but she still works out regularly.Noting the link between academic and sporting achievements and the benefits of early physical activity to women’s subsequent health, Ms Ker Conway oversaw construction of several sporting facilities while president of Smith, the US liberal arts college.Before agreeing to join the Nike board she made sure it would use its advertising muscle to stimulate interest in sport for girls. She persuaded the company to set up a board-level corporate social responsibility committee which she chaired for a decade.She was a regular visitor to Nike plants and suppliers in Asia, initiating research into the working conditions of the mainly female workforce.“As they [Nike] got to understand what was needed, they began to build a discussion with the workforce and to mine it for insight into how things should be done.”"
212;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Nike disappoints amid Fed-fuelled rally;Future orders fall short of expectations for sportswear group;Nike shares fell out of favour after future orders at the US sportswear group disappointed Wall Street, going against the trend in stronger overall US equities markets.Although future orders only just fell short of expectations, it was enough to hit a stock that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 this year. The shares fell 2.3 per cent to $94.84, leaving their gain for the year at 20 per cent.Nike’s quarterly results, however, underlined why investors had chased the shares higher this year and were setting higher expectations. Profits climbed 23 per cent and revenues rose 15 per centThe slump in the oil price provided a boost for Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise operator.Shares rose almost 1 per cent to $44.79 as the company behind the eponymous brand, as well as Costa Cruises, said it expected its fuel bill to drop by $475m in its current financial year, which began at the start of the month.This was worth 61c a share in full-year profits, according to Carnival, which now forecasts will be between $2.30 and $2.60 a share. Wall Street was expecting $2.36, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Cheaper oil has contributed to a 30 per cent rally in Carnival shares since mid-October.Arnold Donald, chief executive, said the company had “worked hard to contain costs and achieved an almost 5 per cent reduction in fuel consumption for the year as we continue to implement energy conservation measures”.Carnival has been spending heavily on marketing to arrest setbacks that have damaged its reputation, most notably the Costa Concordia disaster off the Italian island of Giglio in 2012.The company said profits for the year to November 30 rose to $1.2bn, or $1.59 a share, from $1.1bn, or $1.39, in the year-ago quarter.Shares in Ally Financial surged more than 2 per cent to close at $23.25 after the US Treasury sold its remaining 54.9m shares at that price, against the previous closing price of $22.75 on Thursday.The sale will allow Ally to exit the troubled asset relief programme, which was put in place during the financial crisis.Xerox shares also received a fillip from news that the company had agreed to sell its information technology outsourcing arm to the French IT services company Atos SE for $1.05bn.Xerox shares rose as much as 2.2 per cent to $14.20 after the group said it would divest a slower-growing unit to focus on building up its business-process outsourcing and document outsourcing operations.The company has seen its market value rise from a low of $10.26 in February this year as it restructures.Overall, US equity markets extended their gains, after a surge over recent days in the S&P 500 benchmark index sparked by the US Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement.The S&P had climbed 4.5 per cent over the previous two sessions, lifted by the central bank’s commitment to take a “patient” approach towards raising interest rates, while signalling it was on track to boost rates in 2015, providing more certainty for investors.The S&P 500 index gained 0.5 per cent to 2,070.65 by the end of Friday’s session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 17,804.80, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 4,765.38.
213;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-12-17T17:27:30Z;Li Ning: energy boost;Sportswear maker asks for more capital;It has turned out to be more curse than blessing. For years, Li Ning was seen as China’s answer to Nike and Adidas. A homegrown brand that could show the Americans and Germans a thing or two about selling sportswear in China. Back in 2010 the company’s sales were Rmb9.5bn ($1.5bn) a year. Li Ning had a market capitalisation of more than HK$31bn, and was trading on more than 23 times forecast earnings. It was basking in the glow of a strong domestic showing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. But the company has since stumbled. Its products lack the cachet of international brands and the low prices of domestic competitors.So it has come to this. Li Ning is expected to report sales of Rmb6.3bn this year. Its market capitalisation has shrunk to HK$4.3bn. It is not expected to make profits this year, so there is no PE ratio. There is also no chief executive. And the company is to raise up to HK$1.7bn via an issue of shares and convertibles to fund the next stage of its turnround. Nike (market cap $80bn) and Adidas (market cap €11bn) need not worry.The share issue is priced to go. At HK$2.60, the offer is at a 22 per cent discount to the price before the shares were suspended last week. Big shareholders such as TPG and Viva China, a sports management company, are backing the fundraising. Joining them does not require a belief that Li Ning can match Nike and Adidas. It does however require a belief that the capital can complete a turnround plan that has been under way for two years.The plan revolves around getting old inventory out of the system, and replacing wholesale revenues with retail revenues. There has been some progress on both fronts. Sales rose 8 per cent in the first half of the year. But the net loss widened from Rmb162m to Rmb563m. So rather than feeling the benefit of sales growth, shareholders are being asked to put up more cash. Li Ning says next year marks the start of its “growth phase”. Perhaps. But it has to stop the shrinkage first.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

We’re 148 years old, and we would like to be here for another 148 years.”He added: “We feel consumers are going to be a big influence in this debate, and it’s important for them to know which side we come out on.”The EPA plan would cut carbon dioxide emissions from power stations by 30 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels, primarily by reducing the US’s dependence on coal.The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problem

Further readingThe regulator has set emissions targets for each US state, which must decide how to achieve the cuts by switching to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear or wind, by improving grid efficiency, or by reducing electricity consumption.But Mitch McConnell, who will lead a Republican Senate majority in the new Congress next year, has said one of his priorities is “to try to do whatever I can to get the [EPA] reined in”.Industry and fossil fuel businesses are strongly critical of its climate change plan. A coalition of groups including the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council and the American Iron and Steel Institute, made a joint submission that said the EPA plan would make US companies uncompetitive in world markets.They said: “The proposed rule far exceeds the authority delegated to EPA by Congress and would have profoundly adverse consequences on both industry and the economy.”The groups urged the agency to withdraw the plan and to “engage instead in a process with all interested stakeholders regarding the development of a lawful and reasonable rule”.The conflicting positions of businesses match divisions between US states. A group of 17 attorneys-general from states that either lean Republican or are big fossil fuel or industrial producers slammed the Obama administration’s plan and said it was illegal.We feel consumers are going to be a big influence in this debate, and it’s important for them to know which side we come out onThe green regulator was attempting to “override states’ energy policies and impose a national energy and resource-planning policy that picks winners and losers based solely on EPA’s policy choices,” they said in a submission. Twelve of the states, led by West Virginia, have already filed a lawsuit against the EPA’s plan.A rival group of 13 attorneys-general from Democratic-leaning states and the District of Columbia backed the EPA, filing a submission that said the agency was obliged to act on power plant emissions and had the legal authority to do so.David Flannery, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson in West Virginia who worked on a submission for utility companies opposed to the plan, predicted more legal challenges.“If the administration decides to go ahead with this rule, then we have the odd dilemma of serious litigation proceeding at the same time that states arguably have the obligation to develop plans to implement the rule,” he said. “I am sure efforts will be made to get the courts to stay that or slow it down.”"
215;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Black Friday buoys hopes for retailers;Sector has not enjoyed gains of last year’s level;US consumer confidence has been rising all year and sharply lower oil prices have sparked optimism among investors in retail stocks that wallets will open a lot more as the holiday season begins.Wall Street overwhelmingly expects a 2 per cent year-over-year gain in Black Friday sales but at least a third of those surveyed expect 4 per cent growth, according to Convergex.Analysts at Jefferies are more optimistic over holiday sales growth on the back of job and wage growth, credit expansion in areas beyond car and student loans, lower petrol prices, and another strong year for the stock market and the housing market.E-commerce will be crucial and retailers that have invested in online operations are expected to benefit from stronger online shopping.Stores like Walmart and Target are set to gain market share because they have capitalised on online consumer trends.Earlier this year, Target released a new application called Cartwheel that offers a one-day 50 per cent discount on one toy.Matthew McClintock, an analyst at Barclays, said this was “unique” to Target and “shows how technology is infiltrating Black Friday strategies”.Similar to last year, retailers are expected to rely on two main levers, price and time. But with promotions only likely to go so deep, analysts expect the discounts to run longer.While retailers have planned for deep promotions, it is only the unplanned discounts that weigh on profits, Mr McClintock said. Product delivery delays caused by West Port strikes could result in unplanned discounts.Shares in retailers have not had as great a run as they did last year.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is up about 6 per cent so far this year, far shy of their nearly 41 per cent gain in 2013.Apparel retailers are likely to have the hardest time because they suffer from “a sea of sameness”, said John Kernan, an analyst with Cowen & Co.This is largely because consumers that have been awash with discounts since the recession are now looking for value and are more likely to fork over cash on interesting products.“Everything in traditional apparel is stale and commoditised and the only place where the consumer is not waiting for a discount is where something is new and unique, like athletic apparel and electronics,” said Mr McClintock.Athletic apparel makers are expected to benefit from this shift even at full price. Nike and Under Armour, Apple with its iWatch and FitBit are likely to capture a lot of market share.“We believe the growing dichotomy between the performance of apparel and non-apparel brands is being furthered by the fact that the internet allows for the formation of a somewhat limitless competitor base,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura.He expects companies such as Kate Spade, Signet Jewelers and L Brands will fare better than apparel makers.The benchmark S&P 500 posted its 47th record high for the year on Wednesday. US markets remained closed on Thursday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
216;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-11-14T17:02:02Z;To sell or not to sell;The very idea of a pop star ‘selling out’ has gone the way of Victorian brown furniture. To sell is to sell, period;Twenty-five years ago this week, the world changed. There was, of course, that business with The Wall. But you’ve heard plenty about that. Something else happened around that time too. An out-of-court settlement was agreed between Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and EMI/Capitol Records over an issue that had pitted the surviving Beatles against their record company for two years. The point in dispute (the settlement actually brought peace over a wider range of contentious issues) was the use of The Beatles song “Revolution” in a 1987 advertisement for Nike shoes.This is how it went: the searing guitar intro was accompanied by a short shot of the Nike swoosh, and then some trees, then John McEnroe looking discomfited, another shot of the swoosh, and some people with swimming goggles running into the water. Then came a John Lennon primal scream, and his opening vocal: “You say you want a revolution, we-ell, you know, we all want to change the world.” Lennon had in mind the grand meta-narratives of history: Marxism, Leninism, Maoism. The song was a discourse on how to effect lasting and radical social change. Nike didn’t quite see it like that. Its changing the world consisted of selling sneakers to the sedentary people of all nations.But never mind. On went the advertisement. People cycling, jogging, weight training. Lingering shots of the then-new air cushion technology of the sneakers. No shots whatsoever of the storming of the Winter Palace, or the Long March. Lennon went on: “When you talk about destruction, don’t you know that you can count me out.” A quick shot of McEnroe looking very discomfited. Cute touch.If Nike had used the alternative White Album version of the song, we would have heard Lennon qualify his position: “Don’t you know that you can count me out/in,” he sang this time, confessing his feelings of ambivalence over the use of violence in the pursuit of political change. But this was possibly a nuance too far for the shoe. More people danced, sweated, skipped. Michael Jordan appeared. A toddler sprinted drunkenly across a room. And Lennon concluded with an optimistic mantra: “Don’t you know it’s gonna be . . . all right.”It was certainly all right for Nike, which started a world domination of youth culture. Here it was, announcing its insatiable corporate appetite with a song from the dark heart of the 1960s. The company’s sense of irony matched its single-mindedness. Here was baby-boomer capitalism in full flow.The Beatles, by contrast, were furious. They felt they had been traduced (they lost control over the use of their material when Michael Jackson bought the publishing rights to their songs in 1985). It was, they feared, a slippery slope. And so it proved. The symbiotic interests between pop stars and advertisers became increasingly apparent. McCartney argued that the group had never allowed their songs to be exploited commercially. They had had no end of approaches from “the soft drinks companies”, he said. But they believed in the integrity of their songs, and that they would be cheapened by their commercial use. Nike’s “Revolution” moment changed all that. It sent out the signal that dissent could be commodified, harnessed to the making of money.…You will all have your favourite pop advertising moment. Perhaps Nick Drake’s bittersweet “Pink Moon”, pressed into the service of Volkswagen? Or the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up”, used to sell Microsoft’s Windows 95? Who cared if the song’s lyrics (“If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up”) were almost certainly not about computer software?Sting blurred all the lines when he sang his new song “Desert Rose” from the back of a Jaguar S-Type in his commercial for the car. But, in truth, the lines don’t exist any more. The very idea of a pop star “selling out” has gone the way of Victorian brown furniture.Encouragingly, some of these mash-ups are, whisper it softly, tasteful and resonant. Two years ago, The Beatles raised no objection when another groundbreaking Lennon song, “Tomorrow Never Knows”, was used during the fifth season of Mad Men.The show’s creator Matthew Weiner concluded, surely correctly, that no definitive drama of the 1960s could live without us hearing a single Beatles song. He reportedly paid $250,000 for its use. Lennon’s small psychedelic masterpiece closed an episode titled “Lady Lazarus”, after the Sylvia Plath poem. That is the cultural world we live in today: promiscuous of all forms and genres, sometimes respectful, more commonly exploitative.No one talks about selling out now. To sell is to sell, period. Lennon’s “Revolution” was a clarion call, however equivocal. We went jogging the other way. When his bandmates’ lawyers announced, 25 years ago, the settling of the group’s differences with its record label, they were signalling a cultural, if not financial, surrender. You don’t always get the revolutions you want. The very same evening, the citizens of East Berlin took their pickaxes to That Wall. And a new world was up and running.peter.aspden@ft.com, @peteraspdenTo listen to culture columns, visit ft.com/culturecastft.com/culturecast
217;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-11-12T23:21:31Z;There is no such thing as the ‘employer brand’;Where people want to shop is also where they want to work;How would you describe your company’s brand? Is it desirable? Do people flock to buy your products?You might wonder whether I have decided to stop writing about careers and started a marketing column, but if you are in the market for talent, your brand is crucial to your success.Many people talk of the “employer brand”, but in my experience (14 years of finding talent for brands of every shape and size) there is no such thing. There is just a brand.All companies that have their brand at the top of their priority list know that anyone who comes into contact with it, for whatever reason, should encounter the same values. You can’t have a world-class brand and not react in a world-class way when people apply for jobs.I am reminded of the time Niketown opened in London in 2007, then the world’s largest Nike store, and advertised for staff. Hundreds applied, and the company went to enormous lengths to make sure that every applicant felt they had engaged with the brand.The company hired a big indoor space and invited applicants to come and throw basketballs as part of the recruitment process, and made sure everyone left feeling good about Nike, even though the vast majority were not going to be given work.So I am not surprised by the names on the list of the top 10 organisations announced on Wednesday by LinkedIn as the most desirable employers among its UK members. Google, John Lewis, Apple, BP, BBC, Shell, Microsoft, Unilever, Marks and Spencer and Burberry are apparently the places where everyone wants to work.You can’t have a world-class brand and not react in a world-class way when people apply for jobsThe list’s detractors would probably make two observations. The first is that the rankings were calculated based on an analysis of the 35bn interactions between the 4m companies on the professional network and its 332m members. This includes activities such as viewing employee profiles, visiting the pages of a business and following organisations.However, it does not appear to exclude people looking at their own company, or linking to people they work with.*The other is that all these companies have lots of employees and very active in-house recruiters, which stimulate such interactions.But even if you were simply to ask LinkedIn’s UK members directly what companies they thought were best – rather than track their online behaviour – I suspect the list would look very similar.My company has worked for nine of the top 10 and they are such attractive potential employers that many people will consider salary decreases to join them. Why? Because they have built great brands and people want to be part of them. As a consumer, as an employee, as a supplier, you name it.There is no such thing as an employer brand. There is just a brand – and however you touch it, it should look and feel great.*The activities of current employees are not included when calculating a brand’s ranking, LinkedIn has clarified.
218;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-11-07T13:48:51Z;Nike and rivals such as Lululemon battle for ‘athleisure’ crown;Sportswear giant was slow out of the blocks but like niche brands is keen to capitalise on trend;A few weeks ago an international media circus sprinted to an expensively outfitted Manhattan studio to attend a runway show. There were bright lights, loud music and supermodels, as well as the requisite clutch of immaculately coiffed stars seated front row.But this was not a high fashion moment. Instead, the models sported bold graphic-print leggings, neon sneakers, hooded vests and Lycra Y-back tops. When the show was over, it was the head of the world’s biggest sportswear maker, rather than a fashion designer, who came out to take a bow.“Womenswear is a $5bn business for us,” said Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike, to the sea of smartphones held aloft. That figure, he added, could easily rise to $7bn within three years. “This makes us one of the biggest women’s brands in the world.”Nike generated a fifth of its total $25bn sales last year from womenswear, and Mr Parker sees huge opportunities to grow this part of its business. He is particularly upbeat on the potential for premium-priced, fashion-focused activewear that were on display on the Manhattan runway – products at the crossroads of fashion and sport.The popularity of so-called “athleisure” wear, a moniker combining athletics and leisure, is soaring in North America. In the last year alone, sales of activewear, including athleisure items such as yoga pants, climbed 9 per cent to almost $35bn, according to market research firm NPD Group.Companies such as Lululemon Athletica and Gap-owned Athleta are battling it out alongside Nike in a fitness-infused bid to dress affluent America off-duty.And workout wear that once rarely made its way outside the gym is making inroads at the expense of some traditional apparel stalwarts.“Sports leggings are the new denim,” said Mr Parker, surrounded by models clad in Nike’s casual yet stylish designs.NPD estimate jeans sales in the US fell 8 per cent to $15.7bn in the year ended August, after years of steady growth. But sales for athleisure wear bottoms, such as designer running shorts and tracksuit pants, reached $9.1bn during the same period, up 12 per cent.Industry analysts believe that women are increasingly wearing performance and sports-inspired clothes for everyday casualwear, attracted by the flexibility such items give to busy schedules.“It’s clear that the athleisure trend has been taking share from denim lines and impacting on revenues for the latter,” says Laurent Vasilescu, a Macquarie Capital analyst, highlighting recent sales declines in premium and mass womenswear jeans brands owned by groups including VF Corp.“They might be a fickle target, but all these businesses are vying for the same valuable consumer demographic – fashion-focused women with the disposable incomes who are willing to pay premium prices on transitional daywear.”It is not only sportswear kingpins who are making a play for this growing ‘athleisure’ market. Others – notably fashion labels and show business stars such as Beyoncé – have their eyes on the prize.Continue readingIn many respects, the biggest names in athletics wear, like Nike and Adidas, were slow out of the blocks when it came to developing stylish activewear lines, allowing niche brands to shine.“Lululemon led the way in terms of identifying the athleisure trend – that women were willing to spend $100 on a pair of stylish yoga pants that could take them from a fitness class to the supermarket or on the school run,” says David McGoldrick, US consumer analyst at Euromonitor. He adds that teenagers and men are also contributors to the upmarket activewear trend.“They (Lululemon) played into a broader cultural shift, with people adopting brands associated with healthier lifestyles. They want to look good, whether they are actually working out or not.”But despite being an early leader with its highly flattering and sculpted designs, Lululemon’s winning streak has waned. Complaints last year that its yoga pants were excessively see-through triggered a mass product recall and the exit of former chief executive Christine Day.In August founder Chip Wilson, who had locked horns with members of the board, sold half his stake to private equity firm Advent for $845m. Lululemon stock has fallen 40 per cent in the last year.Now, rivals that had snapped at its heels are eyeing the athleisure crown once sported by Lululemon.Athleta, which gained momentum after opening store locations close to Lululemon before undercutting it on price, has the firepower of one of the biggest US retail chains behind it.Under Armour, the Baltimore-based sports brand known for its pared back and minimalist designs, last month reported a 30 per cent revenue spike. At that time, it said premium-priced womenswear could be as large – or larger – than its menswear business.A recent glossy advertising and social media campaign from Under Armour, featuring ballerina Misty Copeland and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, pictured, was a big hit. It resulted in 350,000 app downloads and a “tremendous” traffic surge to its e-commerce site, with 70 per cent of that traffic comprising new female visitors.Nike may also prove to be a game-changer in the athleisure field.“The 800-pound gorilla in this category is clearly going to be Nike,” said Gap chief executive Glenn Murphy on a recent earnings call.Nike’s top brass seem convinced that they will quickly dominate the sector, given the group’s supply chains, manufacturing network, history of product innovation and a digital community of 65m women.“Once we enter the market we are simply going to make it bigger which is exciting for everybody, especially consumers. If people look good then they feel good. We can give them that edge whether they are working out or not.” says Nike brand president Trevor Edwards amid racks of pastel-coloured sports bras, sleek hoodies and knitted fluoro sneakers.Market leaders in athletic leisure gearNikeFounded: 1964Home town: Portland, OregonChief executive: Mark ParkerVital statistics: The world’s largest sportswear maker, renowned for its eye-watering sponsorship deals, leaves rivals trailing across product sectors and geographies. Consistently robust earnings continue to sprint past Wall Street expectations, with the share price up 21 per cent in the past 12 months.Revenues, 2013: $25.3bnWinning odds: It might have arrived late to the line-up, but Nike’s gargantuan financial and operational muscle combined with its slick new womenswear offerings, will raise the stakes of the athleisure game.LululemonFounded: 1998Hometown: VancouverChief executive: Laurent PotdevinVital statistics: Lululemon’s early fortunes were forged on rampant demand for its high-end yoga apparel, paving the way for the growth of the broader athleisure wear market. But the company has had a trying 18 months. High-profile product recalls, offensive gaffs from founder Chip Wilson and board scuffles have taken their toll. A once-loved momentum stock, its shares are down 40 per cent in the last year.Revenues, 2013: $1.6bnWinning odds: The first mover advantage once enjoyed by Lululemon has long been ceded to rivals. It looks as though this niche player will struggle to regain momentum.Under ArmourFounded: 1996Home town: BaltimoreChief executive: Kevin PlankVital statistics: The share price of this small but serious contender has soared 58 per cent in the past 12 months, with investors impressed by its consistent growth across product sectors, especially footwear and apparel. Under Armour has publicly set its sights on growing its pricey womenswear lines, with its chief executive even suggesting that it could be as large, or larger than, its menswear business.Revenues, 2013: $2.3bnWinning odds: This company has enjoyed soaring growth in the last two decades, but overseas growth remains under 10 per cent giving it limited international positioning.Athleta (owned by Gap)Founded: 1998Home town: San FranciscoChief executive: Glenn MurphyVital statistics: Gap bought Athleta in 2008 for $150m to extend its position in women’s premium sportswear beyond its Gap Body division. Now with a 65-strong store base across the US, its growth has offset flatlining sales elsewhere in the clothing group’s portfolio.Revenues, 2013: Not disclosedWinning odds: The underdog is quietly building a loyal base of customers, but as Gap wraps Athleta’s earnings up with its other niche brands it is hard to get to grips with its overall financial performance and competitive clout.Fashion labels enter the sports gameIt is not only sportswear kingpins who are making a play for the “athleisure” market. Others – notably fashion labels – also have their eyes on the market.One collection generating hype is an “activewear” collaboration between industry favourite Alexander Wang and fast fashion giant H&M, set to arrive in stores early next month. Recent sneakers lines by Chanel and Christian Dior have been flying off the shelves. And Tory Burch, the New York designer who made billions offering affordably priced versions of the chichi uniforms of uptown ladies who lunch, has taken things downtown with an athleisure collection that goes on sale next spring.When it came to spotting the opportunity for a new and lucrative market, perhaps the fashion world was already ahead of the game. The catwalks have been packed with sports-infused inspiration since 2010 – fuelling the rise of what was once a fledgling trend for transitional daywear into a booming billion-dollar business boasting double-digit growth.The latest entrants will widen the pool to include celebrities. In late October, superstar Beyoncé, pictured, announced she was teaming up with Topshop to launch an “athletic streetwear” clothing line. The joint venture, called Parkwood Topshop Athletic, will launch in autumn next year and takes its name from Parkwood Entertainment, the company Beyoncé set up in 2008 to handle her music and other projects. Her colossal brand power and active lifestyle, combined with Topshop’s logistical and manufacturing clout, could prove a winning combination.
219;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-11-06T12:07:40Z;Adidas chief vows to step up fight against Nike ;Sportswear group reports better than expected results;"The chief executive of Adidas vowed to intensify the sportswear group's efforts to claw back lost ground in the US in its battle with market share for Nike as the group announced figures for the third quarter that were better than expected.Herbert Hainer, head of the German-based company, said the group had been “aggressively addressing” its main challenges, in particular intensifying efforts to revive growth in the US.""In North America, regaining our form in this market is the top priority,"" he said.Shares in Adidas rose 5.8 per cent to €60.06 in lunchtime trading after it reported third quarter sales that beat expectations – even though the sportswear group also warned that revenue growth would slow next year.Shareholders had been braced for a significant fall in net income and profitability at the German company, which issued a profit warning over the summer due to sliding sales at its US golf division and exposure to Russia’s economic turmoil as well as currency effects.The figures were not as bad as feared, however, with operating profit down 13 per cent in the third quarter to €405m, and net income falling 11 per cent to €282m, better than the predicted 15 per cent drop.However, Mr Hainer warned that revenues would grow at mid-single digits in 2015, compared with a projected mid-to-high single-digit rate this year.Shareholders have expressed frustration with the company, pointing in particular at Adidas's handling of its TaylorMade golf division, where the group has been criticised for pushing too much product into a market that was already struggling, leading to heavy discounting. FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best global stories, curated by our editorsRevenues at TaylorMade dropped 34 per cent in the third quarter to €138m.Adidas also announced in August that it would scale back expansion plans in Russia, one of its top three markets, as the weaker rouble has hurt sales.A €1.5bn share buyback – which will start on Friday and last until the end of January – failed to spark a rally in Adidas stock when it was announced in October. The shares have fallen 37 per cent this year. Shareholders are awaiting details of the group's new financial targets after it admitted over the summer it would miss its goals for 2015.Revenues were up 6 per cent to €4.1bn between July and September compared to the previous year, a 9 per cent increase when adjusted for currency effects. Analysts had expected a 4 per cent rise.Operating margin – a key measure of success for Adidas – fell to 9.8 per cent in the third quarter from 11.9 per cent last year. The group warned over the summer that it expects operating margin to be between 6.5 and 7 per cent this year, down from 8.7 per cent last year. It had previously targeted an 11 per cent operating margin and €17bn in global sales by the end of 2015. "
220;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Anta: slam dunk?;Market expansion should take priority over handing back cash;Sportswear brands have spent years fighting, toe to toe, over the Chinese market. At the turn of the decade, competition was especially fierce. Domestic brands fought bloody battles with global heavyweights such as Nike and Adidas.The sector seems to have settled. Nike looks established as the market leader, this year reporting $2.6bn in China revenues. Adidas is a distant second, delivering $1.7bn of sales. For both, the market is just a tenth of the top line. But domestic players have struggled to recover from the intense competition of the past few years. Last year’s sales at former market darling Li Ning were down one-third from a peak of $1.4bn in 2010. The collapse at Dongxiang was twice as severe.It has not all been bad news for China’s home-grown brands. Last year, Anta achieved sales of $1.2bn, up 8 per cent since the 2010 shakeout. And 2014 first-half revenues grew by a fifth year on year. The company has been canny. As Li Ning took on the global brands in the premium segment, Anta grabbed share in the mass market. And through ownership of China licensing rights to Italian brand Fila, Anta had a different brand for the higher end. It does not split out its Fila sales. But JPMorgan estimates that in the first half of this year Fila contributed around one-tenth of group sales, or $60m, with strong year-on-year growth.Anta has spent on marketing – $200m in 2013, or 17 per cent of sales (not including any benefit it gets from global marketing of the Fila brand). But this year, Nike spent more than $3bn globally. Anta can barely compete. Still, this week Anta announced a branding agreement with China NBA, allowing access to all NBA logos. This looks smart: basketball is popular in China.But Anta has also lifted its dividend, paying out nearly four-fifths of first-half earnings. This is over two times Nike’s payout and looks too generous for a company that is taking on much bigger global rivals. Anta must choose its battles: it cannot win on all fronts.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
221;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-10-05T23:51:02Z;Out-of-town designer discount centres revolutionise retail;Out-of-town discount villages have remodelled retail, their luxury labels and bargain brands luring savvy shoppers even in the downturn. Now developers have designs on Asia’s passion for fashion;"Cash-strapped but still want a Gucci handbag?From Beijing to Britain’s Bicester Village, fashion-conscious consumers are increasingly turning to outlet villages for their luxury purchases. Typically single-storey, “village” style retail centres selling goods at a 30-70 per cent discount, designer outlets were considered a risky investment as recently as the turn of the century, says Andrew Rich, manager for TIAA Henderson’s European Outlet Mall Fund.But in fact, the sector has defied expectations and its numbers have grown faster than those of traditional shopping centres in the past decade, as luxury retailers have increasingly embraced the concept to dispose of surplus stock and last-season lines. Brand-hungry consumers also rushed to seize discounted clothes in the recession. “Outlet villages have fared much better during the downturn than many shopping malls did,” says Rich. “They have proved a very strong performer during the recession.”Vacancy rates – at around 2 per cent – tend to be lower than at traditional shopping malls, while leases also tend to be shorter – at around 10 years – and tied to turnover, providing retailers and investors with greater flexibility. Darren Yates, partner in commercial research at Knight Frank, says the schemes tend to be managed aggressively. “If they don’t meet turnover, they can be moved within the scheme or ditched altogether,” he says. “The operators are constantly reviewing the tenant mix.“Outlet centres have been relatively recession-proof during the downturn because of the discount angle. This reflects the fact that it’s still a relatively new retail format, having first emerged during the mid-1990s – so growth is starting from a low base.”Although short leases traditionally deterred investors, as they are potentially more volatile, in reality rents keep increasing, says Rich. The widespread use of performance break clauses also means that underperforming tenants could be removed quickly.Some retail villages are among the world’s best-performing shopping destinations, according to the value of salesAnd with turnover at out-of-town discount shopping villages increasing on average by between 110 per cent and 180 per cent during the recession, investment funds have performed well, he adds. “The flexible leasing structure means that outlet operators can respond very quickly to structural changes in the global retail market as well as local requirements,” says Rich. “This is the key to optimising performance, tenant mix and the shopper experience.”John Lutzius, managing director at Green Street Advisors, a property consultancy, agrees that out-of-town shopping villages have delivered good returns compared with much of the rest of the retail sector over the past few years. Furthermore, the gap between good quality outlet villages and shopping centres has narrowed, he says. “Ten years ago, yields for investors were very high because everyone was nervous about the format,” he says. “But premium outlets have been such strong performers that yields have come down.”The popularity of outlet centres has been driven by retailers, which are increasingly promoting them as shopping destinations. Although some luxury French brands such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès have tended to shun outlet villages, they are increasingly on their own. High-end retailers including Gucci, Armani, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry have all embraced the market, while there has also been an influx of north American players opening outlet stores across Europe and Asia, including Michael Kors, Abercrombie & Fitch, True Religion, Coach and Fossil.More established outlet traders such as Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Hugo Boss have also been keen to upscale and create larger, destination stores in the villages. Other retailers actively seeking to expand their outlet portfolio include Furla, Desigual and North Face.The US – where the first modern multi-store outlet centre in the world opened in 1974 – is the most saturated market, with outlet space per capita the highest in the world. But Britain and Italy are also well supplied compared with Germany and France, where restrictive planning laws have curtailed further openings. In central and eastern Europe the market is just taking off, with several schemes in the process of construction.In some cases, out-of-town retail centres are numbered among the world’s best-performing shopping destinations according to the value of sales. And they are also cited among the world’s most popular tourist haunts.Value Retail, for example, which owns the Bicester Village outlet in Oxfordshire, says three out of four Chinese tourists to the UK visit its retail park, making it one of the top tourism destinations for Chinese visitors to the UK.The market with the most potential may well be Asia, boosted by the rapid increase in disposable incomes, increased urbanisation, and a rise in the number of millionaires – whose average age is 20 years younger than those in the US and Europe. The Chinese, in particular, are also more likely to be more exuberant and celebrate success with material goods, says Rich.And although for the most part successful outlet schemes tend to look the same anywhere in the world, China has spawned a series of more interesting designs. In China, designer outlet stores include the Florentia Village Designer Outlet Centre, which opened in 2011 in Wuqing, between Beijing and Tianjin. It is modelled on Venice, complete with canals and gondolas and traditional Italian buildings in pastel shades; it has attracted brands that include Gucci, Prada Valentino, Bulgari, Bottega Veneta, Fendi, Loewe, Mulberry and Jimmy Choo. Silk Road Holdings, which owns the village, is currently working on two new designer outlet shopping centres in Guangzhou and Shanghai which, respectively, will offer 45,000 sq m and 56,000 sq m of shopping. And in May this year, Value Retail opened its own outlet centre in China, a vast development in Suzhou also modelled on an Italian village. It will eventually represent around 100 luxury brands.Rich cites the strong culture of gift giving in China, often in the form of clothing and accessories, as one reason behind the healthy market in Asia. Chinese consumers also like the heritage behind British brands: Burberry, for example, reported like-for-like sales growth in China of 30 per cent in 2013. Nevertheless, there are obstacles, including much outlet centre space that is not of high enough quality for luxury retailers keen to protect their image and status.While traditional shopping centres are suffering from the rise of online shopping, analysts believe that out-of-town discount villages may be insulated from the change. “They are designed for people who enjoy the shopping experience,” adds Rich. “The ambience is very important.”In addition, fashion and footwear, which comprise most of the offering at an outlet, represent a smaller proportion of online sales “simply because people want to touch and feel these items”, Rich says. “We believe that outlet malls are the most likely part of the retail market to withstand the shift to online shopping.”The growing popularity of outlet centres has attracted new entrants including ING, Blackstone and UBS, even though their impact remains niche, accounting for just 2.7 per cent of the total shopping centre market. But while the sector remains small compared with others within retail, Rich firmly believes that this is an expanding market.——————————————-Why investors need to shop aroundEvery shopper craves a bargain, but strong financial returns coupled with limited opportunities mean that investors looking for exposure to the outlet retail market may have to pay mark-up prices, writes Adam Palin.The sector has demonstrated not just exciting income growth, but resilience through the crisis. The €1.5bn TIAA Henderson European Outlet Mall fund – which invests in McArthur Glen designer malls – has achieved average annual returns of 12.5 per cent, after all fund costs, since 2004. By contrast, European retail funds overall have delivered negative annual growth of 0.1 per cent over the past decade, according to data from Inrev, a body for investors in non-listed real estate vehicles. However, opportunities are limited as most assets belong to private companies or portfolios, says Mat Oakley, director of commercial research at Savills. “Bizarrely, the easiest option [for institutions] is probably to participate in building one,” he says. Indeed, the likes of Aviva and Hermes are among outlet developers in the UK.John Lutzius, managing director at Green Street Advisors, says US investors could consider a real estate investment trust, Tanger Factory Outlets. The owner of more than 40 outlet malls has recorded annual total returns averaging 15.7 per cent over the past decade, compared with a US Reit index average of 8.8 per cent."
222;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-10-01T16:11:33Z;Adidas shares boost proves shortlived;Investors voice concern over health of German group;A boost to Adidas shares after the company announced plans to buy back €1.5bn in its own stock proved shortlived after investors said they still had serious concerns over the health of the German sportswear group.Adidas stock rose nearly 5 per cent after the world’s second-largest sportswear company said it would return the funds to its investors over the next three years, mainly through share buybacks. The company also announced it would issue two eurobonds of up to €1bn in total that would help it repay existing debt.Robin J Stalker, chief financial officer at Adidas, said the company believed its shares were “significantly undervalued”. However, the boost to the share price proved shortlived, with shares later up less than 1.5 per cent on the day.Shareholders have been frustrated this year after currency effects and slumping golf sales in the US triggered falls in payouts and a second profit warning in less than a year in July. Shares in Adidas have fallen 35 per cent this year.Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, a top 10 shareholder in Adidas, said: “This is just an attempt to calm down already beleaguered shareholders, but in no way solves the operational problems at Adidas. Top management seems to be under enormous pressure.”Mr Speich had already warned publicly in May that Adidas was being “outpaced” by rival Nike.While the football World Cup this year gave sales a boost, other divisions have struggled – in particular the TaylorMade golf division in the US. Russia, one of the top three markets for Adidas, has been another bad spot, with the company announcing plans in August to pare back its expansion plans in the region as the weaker rouble has hurt sales.One top 10 shareholder complained about the timing of the buy-back plans. Adidas is expected to set out new goals in its quarterly update in November that will give shareholders a better idea of its future strategy after it ditched its profit targets for 2015 in July.“I have problems with the timing. They could have done it with the profit warning or they should have waited until November,” said one shareholder. “That might have been a better point as everyone is now struggling to try to gauge how things will work out for them.”Referring to recent shareholder grumbles, Andreas Riemann, an analyst at Commerzbank, said: “It seems like this decision was taken from a position of weakness. One could argue that they are implementing a defence measure against activists.”Operating margin – a key measure of success for Adidas – is expected to be between 6.5 and 7 per cent this year, down from 8.7 per cent last year. The group had previously targeted an 11 per cent operating margin and €17bn in global sales by the end of 2015.
223;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Nike shares rise as earnings beat expectations despite volatility;Janus Capital surges as Pimco’s Gross joins asset manager;Nike led the benchmark S&P 500, adding nearly $7bn to its market valuation overnight after the US sportswear maker eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations.Despite rising currency volatility, the company said profits climbed 23 per cent to $962m, or $1.09 a share, easily ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 88 cents.Sales in the quarter, which overlapped with the World Cup in Brazil, also surpassed expectations, rising 15 per cent to $8bn as revenues in western Europe climbed 32 per cent.Analysts across Wall Street lifted earnings expectations for the coming year after executives said future orders climbed 14 per cent in the period, including strength in North America, Europe and China.The stronger than anticipated figures assuaged concerns that a strengthening US dollar would crimp the company’s sales and profits over the remainder of the year – as Nike earns more than half of its revenues outside of the US.“Nike’s fiscal first-quarter 2015 results, guidance and futures all impressed, and currency impact – neutral to gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year and no change to revenue impact expectation – was not what some investors feared,” said Evren Kopelman, an analyst with Wells Fargo.Nike shares climbed 12 per cent to $89.50, a record high. Rival Under Armour advanced 3 per cent to $69.82.BlackBerry shares rose 5 per cent to $10.26 after the Canadian company said its quarterly loss narrowed 79 per cent from a year earlier to $207m, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter ended August 30.Revenues, though, continued to fall, weakening 42 per cent to $916m.Having taken over from Thorsten Heins at the start of the year, chief executive John Chen has refocused the company around business users, announcing a new phone for corporate clients earlier this week.Mr Chen has also worked to cut costs. In the quarter, the company burnt through $36m compared with $225m a quarter earlier.LinkedIn climbed 3 per cent to $212.72 after brokerage Cowen & Company lifted its rating on the professional social network from “market perform” to “outperform” following the debut of a new offering to connect businesses with customers.The product, called Sales Navigator, allows salespeople to generate sales leads through LinkedIn, which Cowen says is more effective than a traditional cold call.“We view Sales Navigator as the next catalyst for LinkedIn, driven by new functionality and a salesforce to drive enterprise adoption,” said John Blackledge, an analyst with Cowen.News that famed bond investor Bill Gross would depart Pimco to join rival asset manager Janus Capital weighed on Pimco’s parent company, Allianz.Shares in Allianz trading in Frankfurt fell more than 6 per cent to €128.20. By contrast, those of Janus surged 43 per cent to $15.89.Overall, US equity markets advanced as the commerce department lifted its estimate of second-quarter GDP growth.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,982.85 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1 per cent to 17,113.15.

224;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-25T22:47:57Z;Football and fitness lead Nike sales jump;;Nike has sprinted past Wall Street expectations after fitness-enthused shoppers embracing World Cup fever fuelled a surge in Western European and North American sales.“The middle class is growing around the world, interest in sport continues to grow, and consumers are investing more and more in their own health and fitness,” said chief executive Mark Parker, adding that gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate had contributed to a strong quarter.Shares in the world’s biggest sportswear maker rose 6.5 per cent in after-hours trading as investors reacted to the better than expected figures for its fiscal first quarter. Revenue for the three months to August 31 jumped 15 per cent to $8bn, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $7.78bn.Net income was up 23 per cent at $962m, or $1.09 cents a share, with boosts from gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate. That eclipsed consensus expectations of 88 cents a share.Nike’s biggest gains were in its strongest and most established markets. Revenue rose 25 per cent to $1.7bn in Western Europe and 12 per cent to $3.5bn in North America, despite industry concerns that a stronger dollar and other currency fluctuations could weigh on sales.Football was a particularly strong driver of revenue growth, as well as running wear and technology-infused footwear. The company also pointed to high double-digit growth in its womenswear division, with fashion-focused workout wear at premium prices gaining popularity globally.The “athleisure” trend of wearing activewear outside the gym has also contributed to Nike’s growth, Mr Parker said, particularly in Western Europe.Certain emerging markets fared less well. Although revenue in Nike’s Greater China unit increased 18 per cent to $679m, the company highlighted Russia and Israel, higher inventory levels in Mexico and the weakening Brazilian economy as causes of concern.“We are not immune to macro conditions . . . we continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets, and remain focused on the things we control,” said Trevor Edwards, Nike Brand president.However, investors were reassured by news that orders for delivery between September and January were up 14 per cent before currency moves, exceeding Wall Street expectations of a 10 per cent boost.“We have never been better positioned to realise our tremendous growth potential. 2015 is off to a strong start,” said Mr Parker.This summer’s football World Cup drove a 23 per cent increase in marketing expenses to $897m. The company suggested that these overhead costs could fall over the course of the year now the tournament had ended.Nike, long known for its high profile relationships with sports stars, recently axed sponsorship deals with controversial athletes including football star Ray Rice and disgraced South African runner Oscar Pistorius. However it recently signed a $350m multiyear deal with basketball player Kevin Durant.
225;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-23T15:00:49Z;Nike scores from the sidelines with ambush marketing;US sportswear brand battled with official sponsors for World Cup supremacy;Inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro will never forget the hours leading up to this year’s World Cup final between Argentina and Germany, as thousands of Argentines descended on their city. Many hung out of the windows of coaches to taunt the Brazilians over their team’s 7-1 defeat against Germany five days earlier.But even before the kick-off, some Germans were celebrating victory – at least those working for Adidas.The defeat in the semi-finals of the Brazilian and Dutch teams, both sponsored by Nike, the company’s biggest rival, meant the final would be entirely Adidas-sponsored for the first time since 1990.“It was every brand’s dream,” says Rodrigo Messias, Adidas’s 2014 Fifa World Cup project director. “Having two of our biggest assets playing in the final with the World Cup ball is the perfect scenario.”Adidas and US-based Nike dominate the global market for football kits, which Reuters estimates to be worth more than $5bn a year. While Nike is the world’s biggest sportswear maker by sales, Adidas has long had the upper hand in football, holding a larger share of soccer-related sales and sponsoring the World Cup since 1970.Adidas declines to comment on how much it spent on the 2014 World Cup, but analysts estimate its sponsorship of each tournament costs $100m.However, Nike is gaining ground and is determined to overtake the German company as the world’s leading football brand. The US company reported a 21 per cent rise in football sales to $2.3bn in the financial year ending in May, while Adidas has forecast football sales of $2.7bn for the full year of 2014.But Nike’s marketing strategy is different. Rather than paying to be an official sponsor of the World Cup, Nike sponsored individual footballers and teams and pursued strategies effectively to piggyback the event.In the advertising industry, such techniques are known as “ambush marketing”, but Nike dislikes the term.“We would say that is simply marketing – not ambush marketing,” the company said in a statement.This year, Nike kitted out the highest number of teams – providing uniforms for 10 of the 32, while Adidas provided for nine.“Our football business has never been stronger,” says Trevor Edwards, Nike brand president, adding that there were more players wearing Nike boots in the World Cup this year than all other brands combined.Like Adidas, Nike declines to comment on the cost of its World Cup marketing campaign. However, it says total global marketing costs surged 36 per cent to $876m in the fourth quarter to May compared with the same period a year earlier, “driven by marketing support for the World Cup”.Marcello Queiroz, editor-in-chief of Jornal Propmark, a Brazilian advertising and marketing magazine, says: “Nike is not an official sponsor, but it employs a type of ambush marketing that is very successful . . . through social media and the sponsorship of individual athletes.When Brazil first started preparing for the World Cup, it looked as though ambush marketers might win out over official sponsors. After street protests in 2013, public sentiment turned sour, with anger expressed over the amount of public money spent on new stadiums.Corruption allegations against Fifa, football’s governing body, concerning the 2022 contest in Qatar turned more Brazilians against the event.“Companies tried to associate themselves just with football, distancing themselves from the Fifa brand,” says Rafael Alcadipani of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, an academic institution.However, as the tournament got under way and grew in popularity, the sponsors’ investments began to pay off. According to McKinsey, the top 20 sponsors of the tournament in Brazil poured more than $1.4bn into the event.It was then down to the footballers themselves to determine the fate of the main brands. The brands’ sense of relief was perhaps dwarfed only by that felt by the inhabitants of Rio themselves.After hosting the Argentines for days, they finally watched their neighbouring country’s team get beaten by Germany, followed by its fans beginning their more than 30-hour bus trip back home.
226;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-23T15:00:48Z;Latin American brands gain ground on global names;Home-grown brands pursue stake in region’s $5.7tn economy;"Who won this year’s World Cup in Brazil? A simple question, surely? Not necessarily; it depends on your point of view.For footballers, the answer is a matter of record: Germany beat Argentina in the final.For the host country, the answer is less clear-cut. Although Brazil was dogged by worries about social unrest and late building works, many pundits and even some Brazilians described it as the best world cup ever as the tournament progressed – despite the humiliation of the national team’s 7-1 defeat by Germany in the semi-finals.But for companies involved in the World Cup, the winning brand is still being thrashed out. Ostensibly, the winner was Adidas, the German sportswear company that has been a long-time official sponsor. In a stroke of good fortune, the brand sponsored both finalists, who duly appeared in its kit.Yet Nike, its rival for the spot of being the world’s leading football brand, came a close second. The US-based sportswear company sponsored 10 of the tournament’s 32 teams, versus Adidas’s nine, but was not an official sponsor of the World Cup itself.Instead, though Nike disputes the term, it used “ambush marketing” strategies to piggyback the World Cup, such as sponsoring individual athletes and promoting that sponsorship on social media. According to one study, Nike was the company that most Brazilians associated with the tournament.This is the Financial Times’ third annual survey of Latin American brands, and the sophistication of Nike’s approach in Brazil, combined with that of regional companies beefing up their branding strategies, shows how the concept continues to gain traction. There are four main reasons for this.The first is the region’s $5.7tn economy and 600m people, 80 per cent of whom live in cities, which makes Latin America an attractive destination for multinationals. Nestlé, for example, derives some 15 per cent of global sales from Latin America.Against that, however, local brands are fighting back against multinationals, building substantial “branding barriers to entry”.One example is Peru’s Inca Kola, which has a 30 per cent domestic market share compared with Coca-Cola’s 20 per cent, and has been the subject of a Wharton business school case study on successful branding.Another is Banorte, the Mexican bank, one of what Boston Consulting Group calls “emerging market dynamos” – and increasingly they are eating the multinationals’ lunch.A second reason is that more local companies are going international and investing heavily in their brands to do this. According to HSBC, these so-called “multilatinas” may also be better-performing investments than companies focused on the domestic market.Falabella, the Chilean retailer that is expanding across the continent, is one such case. Other multilatinas include banks, such as Brazil’s Itau and Colombia’s Bancolombia, and, more unusually, a clutch of food lines that have capitalised on their brand recognition among expatriates to enter foreign markets – especially among Hispanics in the US.One of the most striking examples is Nescafé, an instant coffee made by Nestlé. Although in coffee-proud Colombia it is sometimes jokingly referred to as “No-es-café”, the company won a bridgehead for the brand in the US thanks to sales there of its Mexican brand, Nescafé Clásico. “Nescafé was not a big brand in the US until Clásico, which has now become one,” says Chris Johnson, Nestlé’s head of the Americas.These emerging-market companies are increasingly eating the multinationals’ lunchA third reason for branding’s uptake in Latin America is the rise of the equity culture – either to fund growth or because a stock market listing can smooth succession at the family-owned companies that remain a feature of the region’s corporate landscape.The last reason for the importance of branding is more of the moment. As the region’s economies slow with the ebbing of the commodity price boom, companies have had to work their brands harder in order to keep old customers and capture new ones.“Branding is something that has to be won every day,” says Mr Johnson. “It represents trust, and in difficult times people don’t want to risk money on a product that does not work. At the same time, if people trust a brand, that allows you to innovate, which is important for value creation.”“De-premiumisation” is the buzz word here. According to a June survey by LatAm Confidential, an FT research service, more Latin American consumers are now trading down when it comes to buying foods and cosmetics brands than are trading up.One company that spotted and then capitalised on this trend, notes Eduardo Tomiya of São Paulo-based BrandAnalytics, is Brahma with its budget-priced beer, Brahma Fresh. Another is Peru’s Kola Real, which has exported its cheap fizzy drink range to Asia, where it has tapped into a similar emerging consumer class.Still, despite its rising importance, brand value requires a dose of scepticism, especially when comparing Latin American rankings to those ranked globally.Although brand value is theoretically measurable, it is only possible in a rough-and-ready way. Furthermore, by deriving brand value from market information, the rankings cannot include the many unquoted family-owned Latin American companies.And Latin American brands remain far smaller than their global counterparts. Corona, the Mexican beer that has Latin America’s largest brand value, worth an estimated $8bn, does not make the top 100 global list. (Aldi, the budget retailer, comes last, with a brand value of $9.6bn, while Google comes first with $159bn of brand value.)Nonetheless, the changes in this year’s brand rankings tell interesting stories – and suggest some plausible winners for the coming year.The biggest corporate fallers were again commodity producers as the China-fuelled commodity price boom continues to come off the boil. Banks also declined, as Latin America’s consumer credit boom matures.Against that, the brand value of retailers and consumer goods companies has continued to rise, which speaks to the region’s still-strong consumer demand.Perhaps the biggest rebranding exercise of the year was Mexico’s, following President Enrique Peña Nieto’s reform drive. One sign it is gaining traction is how the brand value of Mexican companies has overtaken those of Brazil.What of the winners and losers in the coming year? Mr Tomiya of BrandAnalytics ventures some informed guesses.Sectors likely to fare less well include telecoms companies, such as Claro, which are struggling to penetrate more deeply into the region’s increasingly value-conscious middle classes.By contrast, companies likely to do well are those that can consolidate their brand across the region, such as Avianca, the Colombian airline.“Next year, I think we will see a lot more local icons in the top 50,” Mr Tomiya says.If so, that would spell good news for local brand enthusiasts but tougher times for the multinationals, which may have to buy their way into the region. M&A anyone?"
227;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-21T22:32:12Z;Schooled to lead in the footwear of rebel rock stars;Jim Calhoun, chief executive of Converse, decided to embrace the shoe company’s creative roots;"Amid the mementos and bric-a-brac of a well-travelled life in Jim Calhoun’s office in North Andover, Massachusetts, is a black and white photograph. The snapshot shows Mr Calhoun’s father playing in a college basketball game against the University of Connecticut and wearing a pair of Converse Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers.The photograph is significant for two reasons: Mr Calhoun Sr would later become the legendary UConn basketball coach and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame; while Mr Calhoun Jr was to become chief executive of Converse, the US apparel company.Mr Calhoun got the job three-and-a-half years ago when Nike, Converse’s parent company, “called out of the blue and asked me to take on this brand I’ve loved from my earliest memory”, he recalls. “I’ve been on the good side of fortune and divine intervention.”And lately so has Converse. The 106-year-old company, known for its canvas and rubber shoes worn by anti-establishment icons from Dennis the Menace to James Dean to Kurt Cobain, last year posted revenues of $1.7bn, up 15 per cent from 2012. Every day, more than 200,000 pairs of Chucks, named after Chuck Taylor the American basketball star, are sold around the world.“We are a simple sneaker company,” says Mr Calhoun, who holds an
Executive MBA from the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. “We aren’t asking you to work out or get dressed up. When you put
on Converse, we want you to be you. We celebrate your originality and that’s a really powerful sentiment.”It was not always this way. For decades Converse dominated the athletic footwear industry and was the sneaker of choice for basketball stars such as Earvin “Magic” Johnson. But in the early 1990s, amid an increasingly competitive sportswear industry, Converse struggled and filed for bankruptcy. Nike bought the company in 2003 and later closed its performance basketball line.Mr Calhoun made the strategic decision to embrace Converse’s creative roots by focusing on customers such as artists and musicians. After all, the shoes are celebrated in an Andy Warhol mural and have been the preferred footwear of rockers from Elvis Presley to The Ramones, to Justin Bieber.“We started in sport but we’ve also always had this rebellious creative streak,” says Mr Calhoun. “What I’m most proud of is that we have been able to name the identity of this brand. We are clear on what our role is.”He grew up outside Boston, the eldest of two boys in an Irish Catholic family. Sport was omnipresent. Mr Calhoun was an avid, if not particularly gifted, athlete. As a child he did not have any well-defined professional plans. “If you’re not going to be a coach, what do you do?” he says, referring to his father’s work.He graduated from UConn with a degree in psychology and began working at a PR agency in Chicago. The job was fun and fast-paced, but otherwise uninspiring. It was the first time Mr Calhoun considered going to business school. “I thought an MBA might enlighten me. And it seemed like a good thing to put on the resume.”He had just taken his Graduate Management Admission Test when he was offered a job by Wilson Sporting Goods to run marketing for its soccer and volleyball division. At Wilson he discovered “a love for product and for managing a business around product”.After five years Mr Calhoun “had a sharper plan” of what he wanted to do with his life. Once again he considered an MBA. “I looked at business school as a platform that could expose me to other industries.”He was about to begin a programme at UConn when he received a better offer: a job at Nike’s home office in Beaverton, Oregon, managing its college basketball apparel division. “I had this notion that I can always go back to school, but when will I get a chance to work at a company like Nike?”It was not until he was in his late 30s and an executive vice-president at Disney, in Los Angeles, that he returned to the idea of business school. The third time was a charm. “It was not the same as my two previous flirtations with business school,” he says. “I knew what I wanted. I knew I liked leading people; I liked being in a large organisation; I liked being at a company with a rich culture and working for a brand that had a strong resonance with consumers.”He also knew his weakness: finance. It was the mid-2000s – the era of accounting scandals and a time when fallen executives at companies such as WorldCom and Enron claimed financial ignorance. “I really wanted to understand all aspects of the balance sheet. If I didn’t, it was always going to be an insecurity.”He chose Marshall because the commuting was convenient and the “school’s network in California was unbeatable”.The programme, which took place on campus every other Friday and at weekends, taught him the value of time management. (At that time he had three young children and a job travelling hundreds of thousands of air miles a year.) “It forced me to manage my time and that’s been a good tool going forward.”True to his word, he focused on finance: in every group assignment, he signed on for the finance role. In every case study, he volunteered to crunch the numbers. “The curriculum is in front of you and what you do with it is up to you. Business school is a safe environment to wear a different hat and confront areas where you want to get better,” he says.He talks regularly to many of his business school friends – particularly during football season. “We call it the Trojan network. We all have great school spirit.”After earning his MBA, he moved to San Francisco to work for Levi Strauss as president of Dockers (clothing). In early 2011 Nike called again, offering him the role of chief executive of Hurley, the group’s surf brand. He held that job for a mere seven days before Nike announced a sequence of executive shuffles that placed him in the chief executive seat at Converse.Today its products are sold in more than 160 countries and through 87 company-owned stores in the US. Mr Calhoun says his priorities include international expansion – especially in the UK, investment in Converse’s digital businesses and developing its line of apparel.“I consider myself chief editor of the company,” he says. “We have a meaningful brand that has been successful generation after generation; and we are not short of opportunities.”On the value of an MBA: “I did it for the right reasons for me: to challenge myself in a new environment and to learn. It was not to tick a box. There are certainly some companies and industries where an MBA is required so to speak, but that is rarer and rarer these days.”
On knowing what you want: “I recommend an MBA to anyone who has an understanding of why they want to do it. Understand what you want to get out of it. Business school is not a home for lost and wayward souls.”
On the importance of experimentation: “Growing up, I played team sports from sun-up till sundown. As I look back, I learnt to play a lot of different roles. I got to be a leader, a follower, a good teammate and even an occasional star. There are great benefits to that. It creates a foundation for [how you approach] group activity. It helps you recognise your abilities, your weaknesses and it helps you find your niche.”
On the key to life-long learning: “We have a popular phrase around Nike: ‘There is no finish line.’ It means that your development and your personal growth are much greater than your title. Learning keeps you motivated and keeps you young. It’s a never-ending journey.”"
228;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-19T16:04:35Z;Designers find opportunities in golf wear;Ranges meld fashion and functionality but retailers face hurdles;As style director of British retailer Marks and Spencer, Belinda Earl dresses the nation for all eventualities.But in her leisure time, one of the most powerful women in British fashion also plays golf, and in this pursuit dresses for all the unpredictabilities of the course.“There is a whole world of clothes,” says Earl. “Golf brings out a whole new opportunity.”On the golf course, Earl tends to opt for three quarter length trousers or long shorts from the retailer’s Autograph range with a polo shirt. But along with these requisite items, lightweight knits, such as cashmere, a fleece and a gilet are essential for cooler temperatures. Waterproofs, a hat or visor and golf shoes are also golf wear staples.Golf fashion has evolved over the years to have its own distinctive style. Knickerbockers or plus fours and long socks were a hallmark of the game in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s the sport became known for its distinctive colour palette, as players of the time embraced the most vivid hues.Lyle & Scott had its heritage in golf, before moving into mainstream fashion, while Pringle took a sporty two-piece cardigan and sweater set from the golf course and retailored it to create the ‘twinset’.Today, bright colours remain a feature of the sport.Earl points out that the sport has had an enduring influence on mainstream menswear, particularly when it comes to colour. There has been a significant increase in coloured polo shirts and chinos, and men are now much braver when it comes to colour.But today, golf clothes are largely dominated by the big sports brands, such as Nike, Adidas and Puma. There is a particular emphasis on performance, with special fabrics and fits.Designers are rediscovering the sport as a place where fashion and functionality can meet.J Lindeberg, the Swedish designer, has a golf range that is popular among players. Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss offer golf lines.Ralph Lauren is a patron and official outfitter of The Open Championship and has a retail presence at the tournament. It is also making a big push into the sport with its RLX sub-brand.Hugo Boss has had a golfing range – Boss Green – since 1997.“From day one, we had no doubts that we can offer an exciting and new interpretation of golf performance and lifestyle,” it says.For Hugo Boss, the golf wear market represents a significant opportunity.“We are very satisfied with the growing interest in our brand within the world of golf,” it says.At the moment, Boss Green’s key markets are the UK and US. But it says: “There is a huge potential in countries where golf as a sport is still emerging.”Royal & Awesome offer bright, retro designed golf trousers, which it describes as “for the pars and the bars”, while Under Armour, the US sportswear brand, has successfully pushed into golf. Professional golfer Ian Poulter has launched IJP Design.A number of specialist retailers have sprung up, such as online boutique Trendy Golf, which sells designer golf wear.John Andrew, the professional golfer who founded Direct Golf UK in 1991, says the mainstream golf wear offered by the sports brands has become more stylish.“You would not be seen in a golf shirt going out for a meal in a million years, 10 years ago, but you could wear a golf shirt now to go out for a meal, and not feel ridiculous,” he says. “I don’t think you could recognise golf clothing now, [it is] not far off some of the fashion stuff on the high street.”But according to Conlumino, the retail consultants, golf has been affected more than other sporting categories during the downturn.Andrew says it is not just the recession that has affected the market for golf apparel. Many mainstream retailers now sell quality polo shirts and sweaters at competitive prices.At M&S for example, although it does not have a formal golf collection, items in its Blue Harbour men’s range, which is more sport and leisure inspired, and its ladies’ active wear, are popular with golfers.According to Andrew: “The days of selling a £50-£60 polo shirt within my business are not long gone but they are much more difficult. The price points you are talking are £20-£30.”Another issue for golf has been encouraging more young people to play.Conlumino says golf is becoming more fashionable and cool, with younger participants such as Rory McIlroy.McIlroy has a deal with Nike, Martin Kaymer is the brand ambassador for Boss Green, while Luke Donald is the face of Ralph Lauren’s RLX Golf.Collaborations between golf and fashion could have a role to play in helping the sport attract more younger players.Indeed, Conlumino expects a pick up in the market for golfing clothing and equipment. This will be helped by the fact that sporting goods in general are becoming cheaper thanks to participants such as Sports Direct.Indeed, Sports Direct, the retailer of sporting goods with operations in the UK and continental Europe, recently acquired a stake in Direct Golf.According to Greg Bromley, a consultant at Conlumino: “Fashion and tie-ups with celebrities could be a good way to attract younger participants – but ultimately golf still lacks the glamour of other sports such as football, with young people wanting to own replica shirts with their favourite player’s name emblazoned on the back. These sort of tie-ups could make a difference, but young people will have to be convinced to actually play the sport, rather than just own clothing.”But Andrew believes more young people are starting to discover the sport – helped by participation in schools – fostering both future players and consumers.“It’s a little bit like the lull before the storm,” he says. “It’s only a matter of time before these kids who play golf will come through as spenders.”
229;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Corporate pressure on NFL mounts;;Target has withdrawn all of the merchandise related to one of the National Football League’s leading players as corporate pressure continues to mount on the most powerful US sporting organisation amid multiple domestic violence and child abuse scandals.Target said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn all merchandise related to Adrian Peterson, of the Minnesota Vikings, from all Target stores and its website following child abuse allegations against the player. The Minnesota-based company’s decision came hours after the team indefinitely deactivated Mr Peterson. Target said it “continues to closely follow the allegations”.Nike on Wednesday said it had suspended Mr Peterson’s endorsement deal, while Minnesota-based Radisson Hotels pulled its sponsorship of the team on Monday.In a statement, Nike said it “in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL”.The scandal surrounding Mr Peterson – and the NFL’s response – comes on the heels of domestic abuse allegations against another star player, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens.The league has come under fire since its decision to suspend Mr Rice for just two of 16 regular-season games after a video emerged of Mr Rice dragging the unconscious body of his then-fiancée from an Atlantic City hotel elevator. The league suspended him indefinitely after new footage emerged on September 8 that showed Mr Rice knocking his wife out in the elevator. On Tuesday, the players union lodged an appeal against the ruling.The NFL is the most popular US sports league, generating billions of dollars in annual revenues from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights. But many of the most prominent sponsors have expressed concerns about the allegations in a way that is novel for a league that has in the past dealt with players accused of murder.Anheuser-Busch, the chief beer sponsor of the league, said it was “disappointed and increasingly concerned” with the league. Sponsors including FedEx and McDonald’s have also said they are monitoring the situation.Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton had also called for Mr Peterson’s indefinite suspension.Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, has come under intense criticism for his handling of the situation, with calls for his resignation growing. Mr Goodell has appointed Robert Mueller, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the league’s handling of Mr Rice’s case.On Tuesday the league named Cynthia Hogan, who helped Vice-president Joe Biden craft the Violence Against Women Act when he was a senator, as its chief Washington lobbyist.
230;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-10T10:08:53Z;Sales pace slows at Sports Direct;;"Sports Direct, the sports retailer controlled by billionaire Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, has posted a mixed trading update ahead of its annual meeting.Sales in its core sports retail division, which includes brands such as Nike and Reebok, were up 12 per cent, but sales and profits from its growing stable of wholly owned brands fell. In the 13 weeks to July 27, overall group sales rose 12.2 per cent to £711m and gross profit increased 11.8 per cent to £301m, though this came in below consensus analyst expectations of a 15 per cent rise.Sales in the sports retail division were up 16.3 per cent to £611.8m, and gross profit increased 15.8 per cent to £260.4m.However, sales in its premium lifestyle division, which includes brands such as Firetrap and Kangol, fell nearly 9 per cent to £52m, with gross profit falling 11.6 per cent to £20.5m.Sales in its brands division, which include Dunlop and Slazenger, dropped 7 per cent to £47m with gross profit falling nearly 5 per cent to £20.3m. Analysts regarded this as “disappointing”.There was no further update on current trading, and the group said there had been “no material change” in its financial position.“As we highlighted at our preliminary results in July, recent trading, including the period since 27 July, has been in line with management’s expectations with some stronger weeks offset by England’s disappointing World Cup performance,” said Dave Forsey, chief executive.“Within sports retail we continue to focus on upgrading our store portfolio and integrating recent acquisitions, including Eybl and Sports Experts in Austria. Consistent with previous guidance, we continue to target underlying ebitda [before share scheme costs] of £360m for the current period.”In early trading in London, shares in Sports Direct were down 3 per cent at 697.5p.As retail sales in the UK continue to show growth, the FT keeps up with all the latest news and reports

Further reading“As flagged at the preliminary results, first-quarter gross margins have been held back by clearance activity, primarily in continental Europe, while first quarter sales have not fully benefited from [recently] acquired space completed partway through or outside the quarter,” said Richard Edwards, retail analyst at Citi.Describing the 4 per cent uptick in like-for-like retail sales as “solid”, he said “from here we expect gross margin progress to resume” and reiterated Citi’s buy recommendation on the stock.Freddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The company has been acquisitive over the past year both in the UK and in Europe, which has led to less visibility on the outlook and has meant, in our view, that the development of the company’s internet platform has become less of a priority”.In July, Mr Ashley, who controls 58 per cent of Sports Direct, surprised the City by saying he did not wish to be awarded any shares under the 2015 incentive plan, just weeks after it was approved by shareholders.The scheme, which was voted through at a six-minute meeting that Mr Ashley left by helicopter, allows the Newcastle United football club owner and “all eligible” employees to split up to £200m of shares."
231;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-09-09T03:36:09Z;Apple iWatch makes an impact before release;;The impact of Apple’s new fitness-tracking device is already being felt in the wearable technology market, even before its expected launch in California on Tuesday.While the finer details of the so-called iWatch’s features, sensors and price remained a mystery ahead of Tuesday’s press event in Cupertino, some analysts are already predicting Apple will upset the wearable device market just as comprehensively as it did with smartphones and tablets.Forrester Research believes Apple will sell as many as 10m iWatches in its first year. That, Forrester says, is more than all the other manufacturers of wrist-based wearables have sold to date, including Nike’s Fuelband fitness tracker, Samsung’s Gear smartwatches and devices by younger companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone.Other analysts are even more aggressive in their forecasts, with Morgan Stanley suggesting 30m to 60m iWatches could be sold in the first year.As the focus of gadget makers’ innovations shifts from pocket to wrist, start-ups and established companies alike are weighing up whether to compete head-on with Apple or find a new niche. Overall, analysts at Cowen, the investment bank, believe that the wearables market will reach $170bn by 2020.Apple “will lead” the wearables market, Forrester analysts James McQuivey and JP Gownder predicted in a note published on Monday.Google and potentially Amazon will follow “close behind” but “everyone else will struggle to become anything more than the next Flipcam, Palm Pilot, or Nook eReader”, they forecast.Apple made clear its intentions for the fitness market in June, when it courted iPhone app makers with its forthcoming Healthkit platform and Health app.Previously, Nike had decided to abandon its Fuelband hardware to focus on apps for other companies’ devices. Given Nike’s close relationship with Apple – Apple chief executive Tim Cook sits on Nike’s board and the two companies have collaborated since the Nike+iPod device launched in 2006 – it is likely to be among the first partners making apps for the iWatch.But other fitness wristband makers are doubling down on their hardware plans in spite of the coming challenge from Apple.Intel’s recently acquired Basis smartwatch, one of the first consumer devices to incorporate a heart-rate monitor, will unveil a new model at the chipmaker’s developer conference on Tuesday. Samsung last week revealed its sixth smartwatch in barely a year.Fitbit and Jawbone, meanwhile, are adding new sensors such as heart-rate monitors to their step-counting and sleep-monitoring wristbands. People close to the companies say both will launch their new devices in the run-up to the winter holidays, though the companies declined to comment.Nonetheless, these two leading fitness tracker makers are also hedging their bets by improving their apps.Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsIn January, Fitbit added a feature called MobileTrack to its app for iPhone 5s, which uses Apple’s M7 activity sensor as a pedometer.According to people close to the company, Jawbone is preparing to follow suit with a new app that will perform many of the activity-tracking functions of its current wristband, the Up 24.As well as smartphones with motion sensors, Jawbone’s new step-counting Up app will work on Google’s wearables platform, Android Wear, and devices by Pebble, a smartwatch pioneer. It will also integrate with other apps and devices, ranging from Nest thermostats to MyFitnessPal calorie counting.While the beta test version of Apple’s Health app offers just a basic list of metrics and charts of health statistics such as weight, calorie intake or daily steps taken, Jawbone believes its app offers different enough content and analysis to lure new customers.Extras include nudges of encouragement to do more exercise, by comparing a user’s activity with other people in the same area or demographic.Analysts are optimistic about the longer range outlook for wearable devices for those that can withstand the challenge. This is based in part on demand: a Forrester survey of more than 4,500 people in the US found that about a quarter expect to buy a wearable device in the next year.
232;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-08-15T16:47:44Z;BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti is the man with the viral touch;;"Jonah Peretti has the viral touch. Long before the 40-year-old had started the hugely successful website BuzzFeed in 2006, or co-founded the Huffington Post a year earlier, he had shot to fame on the internet over a series of emails he sent to Nike.As a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab in 2001, Mr Peretti tried to order a pair of trainers customised with the word “sweatshop”. When Nike refused his request, his email exchange with the company’s customer service department became an online sensation – eventually leading to an invitation from NBC’s Today show to debate with a Nike executive.Raised in Oakland, California, near the academic enclave of Berkeley, where his mother taught education and his father was a criminal defence lawyer, Mr Peretti studied at the University of California, Santa Cruz and MIT before moving to New York. There, he teamed up with his sister, the comic Chelsea Peretti, on projects such as an automated “rejection line” phone number that people could give out to unwanted suitors.In the years that followed, Mr Peretti kept experimenting to see which ideas would take off on what was beginning to be called the “social web”.Today, Mr Peretti leads a staff of 550 on the Buzzfeed website, which draws 150m readers a month and is best known for its quizzes and ‘listicles’ – such as ‘21 Wombats Who Understand The Struggle Of Constant Tiredness’. And, this week, his business model won a vote of confidence from Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, in the form of a $50m investment that values BuzzFeed at more than triple the $250m Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post last year. Mr Peretti is reported to have turned down another business proposition from Disney earlier this year.With the financial injection and a reorganisation of BuzzFeed’s business, Mr Peretti says he is building up his company for what he told employees in March is “a new golden age of media”.He has already seen one of his projects end with an acquisition, when AOL paid $315m for the Huffington Post, which Mr Peretti launched in 2005 with Arianna Huffington and Ken Lerer, a former AOL Time Warner executive.At HuffPost Mr Peretti worked on technology, figuring out what content people wanted to read and share. “I was just trying to solve this problem, early on, of how do you make something that is both contagious and sticky,” he told the blogger Felix Salmon in June.That question inspired the creation of BuzzFeed in 2006 as a side project – a “laboratory” that posted short summaries of items popular on the internet.It began to absorb more of Mr Peretti’s attention and after HuffPost was sold in 2011, he went to BuzzFeed full time. A turning point came later that year, when BuzzFeed hired Politico’s Ben Smith as editor in chief and began to put more emphasis on producing original content.BuzzFeed has technology at its core. BuzzFeed takes the internet and computer science seriouslyThe site has poached reporters from the New York Times and Bloomberg; established itself as a breaking news authority during the Boston marathon bombings, and even saw a reporter briefly arrested while covering riots in Ferguson, Missouri, this week.However, Mr Peretti’s ambition to be “one of the great, enduring companies of this new era” in media is driving a difficult transition.Last month, BuzzFeed fired its viral politics editor for alleged plagiarism. Gossip site Gawker reported this week that the company has, contrary to typical journalistic practices, quietly deleted old posts from the site because they did not meet its editorial standards.For all the emphasis on long-form investigation and hard news reporting, Mr Peretti says he sees technology as BuzzFeed’s primary competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded field of digital media.Chris Dixon, the Andreessen Horowitz general partner who is joining BuzzFeed’s board, agrees. “BuzzFeed has technology at its core,” he wrote this week. “BuzzFeed takes the internet and computer science seriously.”"
233;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-07-14T16:24:02Z;Man Utd seal £750m Adidas tie-up;;Manchester United have signed a record shirt deal after landing a £750m tie-up with German sportswear group Adidas.The deal guarantees the English club at least £75m a year for the next 10 years – more than treble the £23.5m Nike had paid for the team’s current deal.The US company had pulled out of negotiations claiming that the club’s demands “did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders”.The deal is worth more than double the £31m, eight-year deal under which Adidas makes and sells Real Madrid’s shirts and comes after Man Utd endured their worst season in decades.The Premiership club failed to qualify for the Champions League and finished seventh in the division, which led to David Moyes, the manager, being sacked before the end of the season.The agreement gives Adidas the exclusive right to distribute Adidas and Man Utd dual branded products around the world and sees the club join some of the world’s top teams in Adidas’s sponsorship stable including Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Chelsea.Herbert Hainer, Adidas chief executive, said the deal would give the group sales of £1.5bn over the next decade.For Manchester Utd, it is the latest in a hat-trick of record-breaking shirt tie-ups that will see it earn $240m per season until 2022 just from shirt sponsorship.Adidas was keen to secure sponsorship of Man Utd given its strong footprint in Asia, where the German sportswear company has a sophisticated network of franchise storesIncluded in this figure is a seven-year $559m sponsorship deal with General Motors, signed in 2012, which kicks in this coming season. This was followed by Aon, the insurer, paying nearly $30m per year over the next eight years to sponsor the club’s training kit and training ground.The bumper deal will go some way to mending the £40m hole left by the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League.Adidas had already seen a boost from the World Cup, announcing last month that the Brazilian jamboree meant it would definitely match its target of €2bn in football sales this year.Yet the company has struggled in the US as well as with the strong euro. Shareholders suffered a 34 per cent drop in net income in the first three months of 2014 compared with the previous year, sparking criticism from some over Adidas’s ability to compete with arch-rival Nike.Adidas is still targeting €17bn in annual sales by the end of next year.Adidas was keen to secure sponsorship of Man Utd given its strong footprint in Asia, where the German sportswear company has a sophisticated network of franchise stores.Shares in Man Utd hit a 12-month high after the deal was confirmed, rising 2.9 per cent to $18.30 in New York.
234;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Cleveland gets LeBron on the rebound;;US basketball star LeBron James on Friday announced one of the most dramatic homecomings in the history of American sports, saying he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers four years after leaving the club to “take my talents” to the Miami Heat.Mr James, 29, is a four-time most valuable player in the National Basketball Association and commands a reported $53m a year in endorsements from the likes of Nike, Coca-Cola and Samsung, according to Forbes.He, however, became a controversial figure in US society in 2010 when he left the Cavaliers, the team that had drafted him in 2003 straight from high school in Akron, less than an hour’s drive from Cleveland in northeast Ohio.Mr James, known as “King James”, inflamed public opinion in the rust belt city – which was still reeling from the US recession – by announcing his decision to join the rival Miami Heat in an hour-long primetime broadcast on ESPN.In a comment that was roundly mocked, Mr James said: “I’m going to take my talents to South Beach.”The owner of the Cavaliers, Dan Gilbert, responded in 2010 by issuing an open letter to the people of Cleveland that said: “You simply don’t deserve this kind of cowardly betrayal.”In announcing his return on Friday in an article in Sports Illustrated, Mr James tried to make amends, saying: “My relationship with northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realise that four years ago. I do now.”The move to Miami yielded dividends for Mr James as a basketball player. The Heat reached the NBA finals during all four years Mr James played for the club, winning two championships.“When I left Cleveland, I was on a mission. I was seeking championships, and we won two,” Mr James said on Friday.“But Miami already knew that feeling. Our city [Cleveland] hasn’t had that feeling in a long, long, long time. My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what’s most important for me is bringing one trophy back to northeast Ohio. I always believed that I’d return to Cleveland and finish my career there.”No Cleveland team has won a major professional championship since 1964.In an implicit admission that his media strategy in 2010 had rebounded on him, Mr James added: “I’m not having a press conference or a party. After this, it’s time to get to work.”Friday’s move will probably be a boost to Mr James’s image, branding experts said.Henry Schafer of Q Scores, a brand measurement agency, said Mr James’s likeability had never fully recovered from the “dramatic” hit it took in 2010, but that his return to Cleveland could help rebuild his appeal with the general public.“Now his brand is not only the wayward son returns home, but he did the right thing,” said Ed O’Hara, senior partner at SME Branding, a consultancy.“People [in Cleveland] will be buying LeBron jerseys and posters again. For his sponsors, the man who returned home and made very happy people out of Clevelanders and greater Ohio, that’s a great thing to associate with.”Since becoming a free agent at the conclusion of this year’s NBA campaign, Mr James has occupied centre stage in the US sports world. Just days ahead of the World Cup final in Brazil, media outlets had been consumed by speculation about what he would do next.One of the ironies of Mr James’s recent career is that despite being the top player in the league, his salary was less than the maximum allowed under the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement. When declaring free agency in June, Mr James said he wanted to be paid the maximum salary of more than $20m a year.His financial position was also boosted by this year’s sale of Beats Electronics to Apple. ESPN reported he realised a profit of more than $30m for the small stake he received in return for promoting the company’s headphones.
235;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
236;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Adidas steals last-minute Man Utd goal from Nike;;Adidas is primed to sign a 10-year deal to supply Manchester United’s kit that could be worth up to £750m after rival Nike declined to match the German company’s offer.Months of talks between Nike and the Premier League club to extend its 13-year kit deal ended with a statement from the US company saying the terms on offer “did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders” and that its relationship would end after next season.Nike was given a period of exclusivity to extend the deal, but when this expired United approached rival companies. It still had the right to match any competing offer but has now decided not to exercise that option.United declined to comment and Adidas did not return calls.If United does conclude a deal with Adidas, it is likely to be the biggest in football and worth more than double Real Madrid’s deal with the company.People with knowledge of the situation said they expect the new United contract to be worth around £75m a year.The size of the deal underlines the fight for supremacy between Nike and Adidas in football, graphically played out at the World Cup in Brazil.Nike was still a novice in football when it signed with Manchester United in 2002, but its association with one the game’s biggest clubs helped position it as rival to the more established football brand of Adidas.Nike now claims it is on course to be the world’s leading football brand, but Adidas, World Cup sponsor and supplier of the Brazuca match ball, has enjoyed a good tournament.Nike said in a statement: “Manchester United is a great club with passionate fans. We are proud to have partnered with them for the last 12 years and will continue to sponsor the club until the end of the 2014/15 season.“Any partnership with a club or federation has to be mutually beneficial and the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders. We look forward to a successful final season with the club.”
237;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-07-07T16:28:37Z;Pharrell Williams/Kanye West, Wireless Festival, Finsbury Park, London – review;Atonement, belligerence and brilliance from the two performers;Women of the world, Pharrell Williams is sorry. He’s sorry for treating you badly in “Blurred Lines”, the notorious Robin Thicke hit in which he had a guest spot. To atone he has released an extravagantly pro-woman solo album, GIRL– the musical equivalent of a bouquet of flowers and a note saying “Please forgive me!”At the Wireless festival in Finsbury Park, Williams surrounded himself with no fewer than nine female backing dancers and singers. In case anyone didn’t get the memo, he played GIRL’s “Marilyn Monroe” early in the set. “I put my arms around her and I promise not to abuse you,” he sang over smooth funk. The male punter walking through the audience filming dancing women didn’t heed the sentiment but at least Williams seemed to mean it: his charm has helped him to prosper post-”Blurred Lines”, unlike the hapless Thicke.That said, his set was unimpressive. Interposing songs he has produced for other acts with his own hits such as “Happy”, he was a lacklustre live performer, unable to project himself to an audience of 45,000. “Blurred Lines” was briefly played, with the objectionable content left out. Meanwhile the best song came immediately before it – Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl”, performed by his backing troupe of singers and dancers, Williams melting into the background as though an observer at his own gig. That was taking the campaign for contrition too far.And so to the evening’s headliner, Kanye West. Shall we start with the good or the bad? OK, the bad. During the ballad-cum-screed “Runaway”, the rapper embarked on a 15-minute rant, which can be summarised thus: I, Kanye, am a genius and anyone who disagrees is a brainwashed dupe of the racist media and fashion industries. “I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me because I’m a black man or a celebrity!” he cried out, railing against the injustice of a world that has only allowed him to design a solitary range of Nike shoes. The boos that rang out suggested sympathy was in short supply.That was the bad. But the good, typically of West, was very good indeed. Performing most of his set in a beaded mask that gave him a genuinely uncanny look, backed by an enormous obelisk on to which colour-saturated images of the performance were projected, he had the entire park jumping up and down from the moment he came on rapping a ferocious version of “Black Skinhead” from his latest album Yeezus.Apart from the rant, the audience response was exceptional, the most animated I’ve seen at a large outdoor gig. West’s rapping was dynamic while the setlist was thoughtfully composed, Yeezus’s more abrasive moments ignored in favour of old hits such as “Jesus Walks” and “Diamonds from Sierra Leone”. He ended with “Blood on the Leaves”, a juggernaut of a track built around a haunting sample of Nina Simone singing “Strange Fruit” – superbly produced but insensitive in its subject matter, Simone’s anti-lynching message yoked to an appalling rap about groupies. The good and the bad are inseparable in Kanye West.pharrellwilliams.comkanyewest.comLudovic Hunter-Tilney was named Arts Reviewer of the Year at this year’s London Press Club awards
238;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-06-30T18:09:07Z;The adverts that score from the sidelines;Brazil’s World Cup has been a boon for brands that are not official sponsors;Brazil’s defender David Luiz has to dash across London on foot after the traffic police clamp his car. Meanwhile in Madrid airport, his Brazilian teammate Marcelo has been forced through security so many times that he is now stripped down to his boxer shorts.The scenes are from a television commercial, by Brazil’s largest airline Tam, that fell foul of regulators. The one-minute clip depicts various attempts to stop Brazil’s expat footballers from flying back to their home country in time for the World Cup. “Our rivals won’t like it one bit but Tam is bringing Brazil’s football stars home,” went the tagline.It has been hailed as one of the edgiest campaigns yet in the particularly cut-throat battle for World Cup advertising this year – a battle that, just like the 2014 tournament itself, has been marked by surprise wins, shocking exits and embarrassing own goals.Gol, Tam’s biggest rival and the actual carrier of the Brazilian national team, complained to regulators in April, accusing Tam of wrongly presenting itself as the tournament’s official airline. But regulators did not rule against the commercial until May – after more than a month of precious airtime.For John Grady, an associate professor of sport and entertainment management at the University of South Carolina, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil is turning out to be a golden opportunity for so-called ambush advertising – attempts by brands to associate themselves with a particular event without paying to be an official sponsor or partner.Prof Grady says Brazil’s relatively innovative advertising market has long encouraged ambushers and cheeky campaigns – noting that these techniques will not be as easy to pull off in Russia and Qatar, the tournament’s next, more heavily controlled, host countries.Brazil’s thriving social media scene has also proved fertile ground for ambush marketing techniques because popular online campaigns can be taken down rapidly if required by regulators.“Because it’s soccer, the event itself also seems to lend itself to a more humorous type of advertising,” adds Prof Grady. Last week, for instance, brands around the world such as Nando’s and Listerine were quick to take advantage of the controversy surrounding the biting of an Italian opponent by Uruguay’s Luis Suárez. Philips produced an ad for its new dental flossing system with the tagline: “Perfect if you have a bit of Italian stuck between your teeth.”TYou are associating your great brand with a brand that might have a lot of baggage and you might actually suffer for ithis year, advertisers that are not Fifa partners have also been helped by the fact that the World Cup’s official sponsors have been wrongfooted by widespread protests in Brazil over the past few months against the amount of public money being spent on the World Cup – underlining the difficulties of pitching campaigns for countries undergoing deep social transformations. After all, few could have expected the football-mad nation would oppose holding the sport’s biggest tournament.After paying significant amounts for the privilege of associating themselves with football’s governing body Fifa, several sponsors have been forced to distance themselves from the tournament because of the protests and focus instead on the wider theme of football or the national team. Criticism of Fifa, which is facing corruption allegations over the 2022 tournament, have not helped either. “You are associating your great brand with a brand that might have a lot of baggage and you might actually suffer for it,” says Michael Fernandez, founder and chief executive officer of Factory 360, a marketing agency in New York.Nike has been particularly fortuitous. According to Jornal Propmark, a Brazilian advertising and marketing magazine, Nike is the brand Brazilians most associate with the World Cup. Yet, not being an official partner at the tournament, it has been able to distance itself from Fifa.“As a fan of football, because we’re not a sponsor, we think it is something they need to address,” Trevor Edwards, a Nike executive, says of the corruption allegations.However, in some cases, the tournament’s imposters have been too successful. The Italian carmaker Fiat was forced to cut short its Vem pra rua, vem! (“Come to the street, come!”) World Cup-themed campaign last year after its catchy slogan was adopted by protesters as a political call to arms.One of the most devastating own goals, however, was probably scored by Adidas, the tournament’s official partner, says Luiz Fernando Turatti, a professor at São Paulo’s Insper business school. The company’s T-shirts featuring a bikini-clad woman and the phrase “looking to score” were withdrawn in February after Brazil’s tourist board claimed that they encouraged prostitution. The Adidas campaign caused immediate outrage in Brazil, underscoring the market’s complexity. “It was considered an affront to the whole country,” says Prof Turatti. Adidas has since apologised.There was an extraordinary change in the Brazilian mood as the World Cup started and the teams started arrivingBut with two weeks to go until the World Cup final, the advertisers’ battle is far from over. As football fever has taken over in Brazil and protest movements have lost some of their initial popularity, official sponsors now face a race against time to capitalise on the tournament.“There was an extraordinary change in the Brazilian mood as the World Cup started and the teams started arriving,” says Sebastião Bomfim Filho, the head of Centauro, Latin America’s largest sports retailer and one of the World Cup’s six Brazilian sponsors. The company signed its contract with Fifa – the basis of its R$100m World Cup advertising campaign – only two months before mass street protests broke out in June last year. “It was a moment of much tension for us,” he says.Meanwhile, other official sponsors such as Apex, the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency, say the hospitality perks of backing Fifa have been worth it, giving them an allocation of seats for clients and contacts, allowing them to generate new business.To some extent, the advertising victories will depend on the football teams themselves. For example, the Italian sportswear manufacturer Lotto, Costa Rica’s sponsor, has been able to divert valuable airtime away from larger rivals thanks to the surprisingly strong performance of the Central American team.However, it is Brazil’s performance that will perhaps prove to be the most important, not only for national sponsors, but for the Fifa brand itself and its global backers. If players such as Luiz and Marcelo can perform just as well on the pitch as on camera – and more importantly if star striker Neymar keeps scoring – it will be easier for Fifa to keep the home nation on side, analysts say.Centauro’s Mr Bomfim Filho and his executive team are praying particularly hard for a Brazil victory – sales already took a hit after Brazil’s disappointing draw with Mexico in the first round, he says. “Neymar has never had so many fans.”Tricks for piggybacking on big eventsLondon, a minuscule French village in Burgundy, had been unknown to the outside world for centuries. But in August 2012, the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power chose it to host an egg and spoon race, offering the winner a betting account with €100.It was all in the name of ambush marketing. The company used the event as an excuse to put up advertisements around London, England, in the lead-up to the 2012 Olympics with the slogan: “Official sponsor of the largest athletics event in London this year!”As the organisers of big sporting events have taken ever stricter measures to protect their official sponsors, ambush marketers have had to get more creative.As well as searching maps for happy coincidences, companies have signed up sports stars to their cunning plans. Sprinter Usain Bolt gave Puma the upper hand in 2008 by repeatedly holding up his running shoes for the crowd at the Beijing Olympics.But gymnast Li Ning inadvertently pulled off the biggest coup. As Ning was the final torchbearer that year, many of China’s domestic viewers believed it was his own well-known local sportswear company (of which he is the public face), rather than Adidas, that was sponsoring the games.

The magnitude of these known issues was larger than expected, but should be temporary,” analyst John Roberts said.Shares declined 3 per cent to $65.44, while rivals Dow Chemical fell 1 per cent to $51.61 and Monsanto slipped 1 per cent to $125.Manitowoc rose 11 per cent to $32.93 after investment firm Relational Investors urged the company to spin off its food business, which makes refrigerators and ovens used in commercial kitchens.Manitowoc said on Friday that it had retained Goldman Sachs as an adviser and has already spoken to Relational.Manitowoc’s food equipment division is a smaller part of its overall business, generating $383m of revenue in the first quarter of 2013. That compares with the $467m in revenue from its crane business.“While there is no change in our fundamental thesis that cranes are a late cycle opportunity we believe that the entry of an activist places a floor on the shares,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.Nike was among the top performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the maker of athletic gear reported an 11 per cent rise in sales last quarter, topping forecasts.Meanwhile, profits climbed 5 per cent to $698m, or 78 cents a share. Analysts had predicted earnings of 75 cents a share.Although Nike was hit by a drop in emerging-market currencies earlier in the year, the US company said it enjoyed rising sales in every major market other than Japan last quarter.Future orders also eclipsed Wall Street’s forecasts. Excluding the effects of currency changes, orders for the period from June to November are $13.3bn, up 12 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Nike shares climbed 1 per cent by close Friday to $77.68.Shares of Michaels, the crafts retailer taken private by Bain Capital and Blackstone in 2006, were little changed in their debut on Friday.The Texas-based company sold 27.8m shares at $17 apiece, raising $473m. It had hoped to sell shares at between $17 and $19, which would have raised as much as $528m.Dollar General led the S&P 500 lower after the company announced its chief executive would retire.Shares fell 7 per cent to $57.19 on the news Rick Dreiling would leave in May 2015. The company will begin a search for new leadership amid potential industry-wide consolidation. Family Dollar shares declined 2 per cent to $66.84 and Dollar Tree fell 1 per cent to $53.35.Tencent, the gaming and social media conglomerate based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said on Friday it will purchase nearly a fifth of 58.com for $736m.Tencent said it would integrate 58.com’s services into its online offerings. 58.com expects to use part of the proceeds to repurchase 27.6m shares from pre-IPO shareholders.Shares of 58.com were choppy in New York trading, falling as much as 4 per cent to $48.59 before rebounding to $54.90 by close.Overall, US equity markets continued to drift sideways despite better than expected consumer confidence figures.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,960.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 5.7 points to 16,851.84.

240;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike takes on Adidas in Brazil World Cup;;Germany versus the US in Thursday’s World Cup clash could have been a proxy for football’s biggest commercial battle this summer – Adidas’s relentless struggle with Nike for the hearts, minds and wallets of the fans.On the pitch, they were both winners. Germany prevailed 1-0, but the two teams went through to the next round.Brazil 2014 is turning out like that for the two sportswear giants, as the rising tide of World Cup euphoria lifts all boats. Oregon-based Nike scored a winning set of earnings on Thursday, despite soaring expenses relating to the tournament.Sales related to Nike football products jumped 21 per cent in 2014 to $2.3bn in its latest financial year, and the group believes much of that drive is thanks to the number of high-profile teams and star players within its sponsorship stable.“More World Cup players are wearing Nike than all other brands put together,” said Trevor Edwards, Nike’s brand president, on a conference call this week.Bavaria-based Adidas, a Fifa sponsor, is predicting €2bn sales from football in 2014, up from €1.7bn in 2012 and €1.5bn in 2010 when the World Cup was played in South Africa.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, is expecting 8m shirt sales, compared with the 6.5m sold in 2010. Its Brazuca, the official match ball, is heading for 14m sales, compared with 13m for the 2010 Jabulani ball.But this is no football friendly. Nike is determined to outflank its German rival to become the world’s leading football brand, and Mr Hainer is under pressure from shareholders over how to halt the Nike juggernaut.Adidas, which updates investors next month, highlighted the strength of sales in Latin America and of its Brazuca Twitter handle, which has 2.4m followers. Meanwhile smaller players such as Puma have attracted attention with their eye-catching, contrasting coloured boots.But Nike is also on its game, and has Brazil’s national team, with its golden boy Neymar, on its side. It boasts strong growth in its social media football platforms and 380m views for its three video promotions.Revenue for the three months to May 31 rose 11 per cent to $7.4bn, fuelled by strong sales of Nike apparel and footwear in North America and western Europe. Net income from continuing operations increased by 3 per cent to $698m, or 78 cents per share, beating Wall Street forecasts.FT news and analysis on the football tournament in BrazilThe Nike-Adidas battle has been going the American company’s way, according to Tim Crow of brand consultants Synergy.“Nike has been eating Adidas’s lunch all over the world for a long time now,” he said. “It certainly appears Nike is going to overtake Adidas as a football brand before too long. It is a question of when, not if.”Geographically, the strongest gains remain in mature markets such as North America, which generates 40 per cent of Nike sales despite an increasingly competitive environment, and western Europe, where fourth-quarter revenue grew 18 per cent.Nike said “futures orders” of overall merchandise between July and November were up 11 per cent, suggesting that World Cup momentum might linger long after the end of the tournament.The measure is closely watched because investors view it as a proxy for future sales.More World Cup players are wearing Nike than all other brands put togetherBefore Nike’s results were released, its shares had fallen 2.4 per cent this year, trailing the 5.8 per cent increase in the S&P 500, but better than the 21 per cent slide in Adidas stock. Nike shares were up 3 per cent to $79.35 in premarket trading on Friday. Adidas shares were up 0.6 per cent at €73.31 in lunchtime trading.“Nike didn’t get football for a long time and worried about it,” said Mr Crow. “Then they realised that the 15, 16 or 17-year-old boy who was at the epicentre of Nike marketing wanted brilliant and entertaining football.”Nike began the tournament with 10 teams and global stars Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, Neymar and England’s Wayne Rooney as its prime ambassadors. Adidas, which extended its Fifa sponsorship to 2030, had nine teams, plus Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Uruguay’s Luis Suárez.With the first round now complete, they each have five teams left, and only Neymar and Messi of their respective stables of ambassadors are still in the tournament.A final pitting Brazil (Nike) against Argentina (Adidas) would be a fitting climax not just on the pitch but in the retail stores.

Total revenues for the fiscal year grew 10 per cent to nearly $28bn.Football was a key driver of revenue growth in the quarter, as well as running wear and womenswear.“Our comprehensive offensive both on the pitch and in the marketplace drives our leadership as the world’s best football brand, and positions us for growth in this category for years to come,” said Trevor Edwards, Nike Brand president.Mr Edwards added that sales related to Nike football products had risen 21 per cent in 2014 to $2.3bn, and that Nike had enjoyed rising sales in every main market other than Japan during the past quarter.Orders for delivery between June and November jumped 12 per cent to $13.3bn excluding currency changes, in line with expectations.The results fell on the same day as the World Cup game between the US and Germany, with both going through to the next round. Off the field, Oregon-based Nike has been locked in a battle with German arch-rival Adidas for the hearts, minds and wallets of football fans and control of the booming soccer-related product market. NPD Group recently estimated that the sector would grow 8 per cent this year to $17bn.Though Nike is the world’s biggest sportswear maker, Adidas has long dominated the market for soccer boots, clothes and other equipment, and is the official sponsor of the World Cup. But Nike has won significant sponsorship deals, including with 10 of the world’s leading soccer players.Marketing expenses from the tournament in Brazil pushed costs up 21 per cent to $2.4bn.Before the results were released Nike shares had fallen 2.4 per cent this year, trailing the 5.8 per cent increase in the S&P 500 but better than the 21 per cent slide in Adidas stock. They closed on Thursday at $78.86.

We expect Fifa to take all necessary steps to address the issue.”BP, whose Castrol brand is another second-tier sponsor, also called on Fifa to deal with the allegations in “a right and proper manner”.According to insiders at the sponsors, the statements were co-ordinated.“It is pretty obvious,” said one insider. “The sponsors realise these repeated allegations are not good for anybody, not good for Fifa and not good for the sponsors.” Fifa, was feeling the pressure from sponsors, he added.As Brazil prepares for the start of the World Cup on Thursday, Mr Blatter was shoring up his own position, corralling Fifa members to support his campaign for re-election for a fifth four-term.Responding to allegations in the Sunday Times about the way Qatar won the right to host the 2022 tournament, he told a meeting of Asian football officials in São Paulo: “The way the British press have started this Qatargate, I do not exactly know the rationale behind it. But we have to maintain the unity in Fifa.”Qatar has always maintained it won the bid on merit. But in a nod to Fifa’s critics, Mr Blatter said Michael Garcia, the US attorney examining the allegations, would address Fifa member gathering this week in São Paulo.Sponsors do not provide as much income to Fifa as broadcasters, who make up around 60 per cent of the governing body’s revenues. Fifa estimates it will make $5bn of revenues in 2015-18 – $2.7bn from broadcast deals and $2.3bn from a combination of sponsorship, hospitality and ticketing.When the sponsors said funding was at stake, the problem could not be ignored, says Michael PayneContinue readingThe top six sponsors are each paying €40m-€70m for their four-year deals, according to sponsor insiders. One said they spend double that amount promoting their deals through media campaigns.Sponsors react in different ways to controversies affecting the sports brands they support.Nike, for example, has stuck with Tiger Woods despite the golfer’s sullied reputation. The company only ended its support for Lance Armstrong when the cyclist’s fall from grace was all but complete. But it parted company with Paralympian Oscar Pistorius almost immediately after he was arrested on suspicion of his girlfriend’s murder.Fifa’s tarnished reputation is usually brushed aside by its sponsors. They deflect it by emphasising how they are sponsors of the World Cup rather than the football governing body. One sponsor insider said: “Nobody loves Fifa.”Simon Chadwick, sports business professor at Coventry University, said there was an emerging “market-driven morality” governing whether sponsors stick with tarnished sports brands.But though World Cup sponsors might suffer from reputation damage and even adverse sales through association with Fifa, they face big strategic calls.“These are huge investments to simply walk away from,” he said. Furthermore, withdrawal “potentially cedes control and power to a market rival”.Adidas, a World Cup sponsor since 1970, which is signed up until 2030, began its marketing programme last summer promoting the national teams of Spain, Argentina, Germany and others. It is targeting €2bn in football product sales this year.The German sportswear brand, for whom the World Cup is the biggest test of its battle with rival Nike to dominate the football market, said while it was global partners of Fifa, “what’s important for us is to activate around the world”.
243;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-06-04T16:36:56Z;First Solar climbs on import duty plan;;US solar panel manufacturers were lifted on Wednesday by the Commerce Department’s proposal to impose fresh import duties on solar panels manufactured in China.The decision comes after an investigation by the department found components manufactured in the world’s second-largest economy had been subsidised in a way that damaged American counterparts.While the proposal is not yet final, it would impose a tariff of 26.9 per cent on nearly all solar panel manufacturers, although it would differ for several companies.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the duties would weigh on Chinese solar panel manufacturers and could lead to increased prices.“The amount of the duty is worse than expectations of 10 to 15 per cent and will effectively disrupt the market, assuming a last-minute settlement isn’t reached or the final determination isn’t lowered if China provides more information to the US,” Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin said.Shares of First Solar climbed almost 4 per cent to close at $65.39 while SunPower advanced 7 per cent to $34.25. Meanwhile, Yingli Green Energy fell 4.24 per cent to $2.83, Trina Solar declined 4.55 per cent to $12.38 and JinkoSolar slid 7.5 per cent to end at $24.99.Under Armour shares rose almost 5 per cent to $53.63 after brokerage Jefferies lifted its view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ as the brand’s resonance with consumers accelerates.The investment bank, which conducted a survey of more than 2,000 parents, said the company ranked second only to Nike in terms of “coolness”.“We think sales can exceed $15bn over the next 10 years, based on strong secular athletic trends across multiple categories and our proprietary survey work that shows Under Armour’s growing dominance with the youth generation and women,” analyst Randal Konik said.Coach was under pressure on Wednesday after Sterne Agee downgraded the company to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ as the US accessories retailer continues to struggle through a turnround.Analyst Ike Boruchow said current trends were likely to remain “lacklustre” and there was little visibility into the company’s efforts to boost sales.“While the company’s strategies to kick start the business may bear fruit over the long term, we believe fundamentals will remain challenged in the near term, which continues to put both earnings and the multiple at risk,” he said.Wet weather and the later-than-usual Easter exacerbated weakness in Coach’s North American business at the start of the year, weighing on its still early turnround. Coach shares fell 2.55 per cent to close at $39.Legg Mason shares advanced after the company said it would sell its wealth management business, Legg Mason Investment Council, to Stifel Financial.The business, which manages more than $9bn in assets, follows several other acquisitions made by Stifel this year, including two investment banking businesses.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Shares of Legg Mason rose 2 per cent to $50.18 while Stifel was 1.56 per cent higher at $45.58.Travelport fired the starting gun for its upcoming initial public offering, filing plans with US securities regulators to list shares publicly.The company, which provides reservation software and other services to the travel industry, said it would raise $100m, a place holder figure that is likely to change.Overall, US equities shifted higher on Wednesday after declining marginally a day earlier.The S&P 500 rose 0.19 per cent to 1,927.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher at 16,737.53. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.41 per cent to end the day at 4,251.64.
244;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Is the price point of wearables weighing on sector growth?;;"Fashion, just like the tech world, is borne from, reflective of and defined by the cyclical and cultural trends that continually evolve and adapt around it.Both are businesses that are high-risk and tricky to be in, balancing books around supply and demand. But, more specifically, the real art that defines leaders from the pack is preemptively being able to guess what people want and need before they manage to recognize it for themselves. The best at this are making billions, both in fashion and tech.But there’s one overlapping sector which both the titans of Silicon Valley and tastemakers of London, New York, Paris and Milan are still struggling to get en vogue.Wearables.And it should have been so easy. Both have been battling to get consumers on board with wearables for a while now; but neither industry – despite recent combined efforts – seems any closer to be winning the war.A study by L2Think Tank released on Tuesday in collaboration with Intel showed that while 75 per cent of consumers are aware of wearable tech, only 9 per cent said they thought they’d ever want to use it.What’s more, just two per cent of those questioned said they actually own a device.Not exactly encouraging, given the firepower desperately being thrown at the sector. So what’s going wrong?The chart below suggests rather a lot – but its not quite what I’d have expected:Apparently expense is, by far and away, the biggest barrier to purchase. But can that really be right?Presumably – as has been shown by soaring sales of luxury handbags or the increasing ubiquity of Apple products the world over – shoppers will always pay up if they are convinced they’re making a worthwhile investment.So in terms of price-point, wearables are wandering in no man’s land, neither with a significant enough premium to suggest you are getting your hands on something really special, nor cheap enough to mean you would buy one without second thought.What’s more, wearables wielders by and large are seen as geeky ‘Glassholes’ or fitness fanatics: elitist perhaps, but inpenetratable, and for all the wrong reasons. Look, comfort and even health risks pose understandable concerns and unattractive associations.So the problems here then, lie primarily with marketing – and require critical product re-positioning – two key moves that won’t be easy to execute.Perhaps that was one of the reasons why Nike chose to backpedal on the production of its Fuelbands, opting for the easier route of becoming a software provider instead. And its certainly the motivation between the number of high profile partnerships announced recently between the fashion and tech worlds – think Nike and Apple, Fitbit and Tory Burch of Luxottica and Google Glass to name but a few.As Professor Scott Galloway of L2 remarked:“Acting alone, few brands possess the capital, technical prowess and innovation necessary to push wearables into the mainstream”But aesthetics alone won’t push wearables into consumers minds – not while their potency as a possible status symbol – ie the underpinning of the bulk of luxury spending – is yet to be efficiently harnessed. Surely once that’s sorted out – you can charge what you like."
245;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-06-02T19:29:14Z;Apple seeks to make iPhone a health hub;;"Apple wants to make the iPhone into a hub for consumers’ health information from a variety of apps as it prepares the ground for the expected launch of its iWatch wearable device.A new platform called HealthKit was the centrepiece of a swath of new features in iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone and iPad’s operating system, and Mac OS X, its desktop software that is increasingly tied to iOS, revealed by Apple at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday.A simultaneous overhaul of Apple’s tools for developers took aim at Google and its Android platform, as the two mobile industry leaders scrap over the best apps and the loyalty of those who make them.Apple’s new offerings included a programming language, Swift; the ability to write apps that tap into the iPhone’s keyboard, TouchID fingerprint sensor and other core elements of iOS; and CloudKit, a suite of web services in direct competition with those from Google, Amazon and Microsoft.It also showed off a platform for controlling smart-home devices such as lightbulbs, doors and thermostats called HomeKit and new features in its iMessage app to challenge the likes of Snapchat and WhatsApp Messenger.Emphasising the “integrated and continuous experience” between iOS and Mac devices, Tim Cook, chief executive, called the update “the biggest release of iOS since the introduction of the App Store” in 2008.An Apple app called Health will provide a central repository for data from a range of apps made by independent developers, from activity-monitoring wristbands such as Fitbit and Jawbone to weight, heart rate and blood pressure measures.HealthKit will provide a central system for sharing this information between apps so that a Nike running app, for instance, could automatically take weight data from an internet-connected scales from WiThings.Apple aims to put itself at the centre of a growing community of fitness app developers, healthcare providers and wearable device makers.Competition is heating up in the market for consumer health-tracking apps and devices, as established companies such as Jawbone and Fitbit and start-ups including MyFitnessPal and Scanadu look to take advantage of smartphones’ growing ability to monitor fitness, nutrition and other personal metrics.According to Rock Health, a fund dedicated to digital health, a record $2bn was invested in such companies last year, up 39 per cent from 2012.However, even large companies have struggled to find the right product to achieve widespread appeal. This year it emerged that Nike plans to end production of its FuelBand activity-tracking device after poor sales.Some analysts questioned how popular HealthKit will be, especially given growing concerns about protection of personal information.“Storing health data in the cloud comes with regulatory implications,” said Jan Dawson, tech analyst at Jackdaw Research. “There is a big outstanding question about where data is stored and how it might be accessible to other devices.”Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software engineering, who took an unusually prominent role in the WWDC keynote this year, promised that HealthKit would protect customers’ privacy and give them “total control” over which apps have access to different kinds of information.Apple did not announce any new hardware products at WWDC but is expected to join the wearable devices race with its own long-rumoured iWatch, which will tie into the Health app when it launches in the coming months.The drive into health is one of several steps designed to bolster the appeal of Apple’s family of devices by making them more integrated, as its market share shrinks in the face of Android smartphones led by Samsung.Apple said on Monday it had sold more than 800m iOS devices since the iPhone launched, including 500m of its flagship smartphone, 200m iPads and 100m iPod Touch devices. Mr Cook said 130m people had bought their first Apple device in the past 12 months.As it happened: Apple shows off its new suite of devices at its 2014 developer conferenceAlso at WWDC, Apple launched improvements to Siri, its voice-activated virtual assistant, and a new predictive keyboard, dubbed QuickType, which will be included with iOS 8. Users will also be able to install third-party keyboards, such as Swype or Swiftkey, for the first time.Owners of iPhones and iPads can now use the iMessage app to share their location and short audio messages, and allow text and photos to disappear after they have been read, a feature of Snapchat and WhatsApp.“Very flattering to see Apple ‘borrow’ numerous WhatsApp features into iMessage in iOS 8,” tweeted Jan Koum, chief executive of WhatsApp, which is in the process of being acquired by Facebook.A new addition to Apple’s iCloud online storage system, iCloud Drive, adds the ability to sync files between devices and browse for them in folders across iPhones, Macs and Windows PCs – a shot across the bow of rivals Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft services.Developers will be able to access the new iOS and OS X immediately, but consumers must wait until later in the year."
246;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Global brands: Nike sees gold in fitness data;The company is focusing on wearable sports technology software rather than the accessories themselves;For a time, Nike ran rings around the competition in the wearable technology market.Its $149 FuelBand, launched in 2012, offered customers a thin rubber bracelet that would track their biorhythmic data, upload them to Apple devices and then make that information accessible and shareable.Within two years, the network’s fan base grew to almost 30m members, as users embraced Nike as a provider of fashion-focused workout wear.Trainers and running shorts this was not. But industry observers were quick to suggest the group’s expansion over a new digital frontier was part of a broader trend emerging among the world’s most successful fashion brands.Other companies offering accessories related to – but separate from – their original raison d’être seem to have gained customer loyalty and market share rapidly.The BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking placed Nike 34th for 2014, a leap of 22 places from the previous year, with its brand value increasing 55 per cent.But for a company that spent $733m on advertising in its latest quarter, has the much-hyped FuelBand helped generate concrete sales?Perhaps not. Shockwaves rippled through the industry this month, when Nike announced it was stopping the FuelBand’s development.The market has been getting increasingly crowded as rivals such as Jawbone, Samsung and Fitbit have launched comparable models, but Nike insists it has not bowed out of the race.“We are focusing more on the software side of the [FuelBand] experience,” says Mark Parker, Nike chief executive, as speculation rises that its activity-tracking software will end up on the rumoured Apple iWatch, which is expected to be unveiled this year.Unit sales of physical bands have always been kept under wraps, but are thought to be less than 5m, leaving a question mark over their success.But if return on investment is measured beyond short-term cash in hand, and instead on the long-term value of having a link to customers – and access to data on their behaviour and fitness – then Nike could strike gold.Amid the explosion in the wearables market and its probable dominance by technology groups such as Apple and Amazon – the latter has just opened an online wearable technology store – Nike’s step away from its trend-focused fitness apparel roots may turn out to be shrewd.As it seeks to exploit its brand as a leading force in sports and fitness, Nike’s move from clothing and accessories to digital connectivity may prove lucrative, but for the time being it remains high-risk.
247;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-05-16T21:25:50Z;Vietnam government’s role under scrutiny as factories face rebuilding task;;Fires still burned as Richard Tsai edged through the charred ruin of his Taiwanese-owned bicycle parts factory outside Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City.Amid the broken glass and burnt saddles of an operation that supplied leading European companies, the DDK chairman told how an anti-Chinese mob had torched the place – and left a Chinese employee dead.“We never expected anything like this,” he said, moments before firefighters ushered him away from under the charred and dangerously sagging roof. “Even in a nightmare, it could never happen.”His sorrow and anger capped a week of turmoil that has shuttered companies in one of the world’s consumer goods manufacturing hubs, dented Vietnam’s business reputation and raised questions over the behaviour of a government historically hungry for foreign investment.As officially-sanctioned protests against Beijing over a maritime dispute with Hanoi escalated into riots at industrial parks across the country, businesses have been left counting the cost – and nervous that fresh demonstrations expected this weekend could bring more trouble.“The Vietnamese government has been acquiescing [in the protests],” said Henry Hsieh, owner of Chin Li Plastic Industrial, the second-largest shoe sole maker in Vietnam, which supplies Nike, Adidas and Puma. “It’s very clear. It has been three days and the government has done nothing at all – and has let the mobs do whatever they want.”The first sparks were lit by rare public demonstrations in several big Vietnamese cities last weekend, in response to the growing international dispute over the rights to the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands about 150km northeast of Vietnam. After news of the arrival a Chinese oil drilling rig in the area surfaced this month, Hanoi dispatched a flotilla of vessels that have since clashed with Chinese boats sent to defend the rig.But the protests on Vietnam’s shores took a terrifying twist as what started out as peaceful worker rallies at factories in several provinces turned into the burning and ransacking of foreign-owned businesses with perceived Chinese links. The government initially put the death toll at one, although many details of the violence are only gradually emerging in an autocratic state where information is tightly controlled.At the Singapore-run industrial park outside Ho Chi Minh City that was one of the highest-profile trouble spots, the atmosphere was calm but full of worry on Friday as targeted companies tried to clean up the debris and many others stayed closed as a precaution. At Saigon Glass, two employees taped a Vietnamese flag to the gateway – one of many makeshift corporate efforts to ward off the mob, with banners carrying messages such as “100 per cent cent capital from Korea” and “We try our best to protect the islands and sea of Vietnam”.A Saigon Glass executive came out to offer bottles of water, but would not talk. “We don’t have time for public relations,” he said, turning back towards a forecourt scattered with trashed office equipment and two stone lions toppled from their entrance plinths. “We need time to rebuild.”While the operations of western multinationals such as Siemens and Kimberly-Clark looked intact, Taiwanese businesses have suffered badly. Chen Borshow, director-general of the Taipei economic and cultural office in Ho Chi Minh City, said more than 100 of the 4,000 odd Taiwanese businesses in the country had been attacked. “Taiwanese companies are one of the biggest contributors to Vietnam’s economic development,” he said. “So our people are really wondering what’s going on.”Executives and employees at several industrial parks near Ho Chi Minh City told how demonstrations by factory workers were later hijacked by roving gangs on motorbikes who heavily outnumbered local police and were armed with metal pipes and wooden staves. People who had joined the initial demonstrators said they did not recognise the late arrivals, some of whom covered their heads with helmets or scarves.While the identities of the rioters remain a mystery and their sudden, apparently organised, appearance unexplained, past Vietnamese protests over land and against the police have spontaneously turned violent. Social pressures include youth unemployment and the tough conditions facing the staff of one of the workshops of the world. “We work for long hours but the pay is low,” said Nghe, a leather-cutter at a shoe factory who makes about $200 a month, as rain drummed on the corrugated metal roof of her family’s one-room house. “So it’s very stressful.”The Hanoi government has branded the rioters “bad people” and called on local governments, the police and military to stop them. But it is not lost on the Vietnamese public that the announcement stopped short of ordering protests to cease – and even appeared to offer encouragement for more, with its call for people to “contribute to the nation to protect our sovereign territory, following national and international law”.Back at DDK’s charred factory, Mr Tsai had little sense of what the future might hold for his company’s longstanding relationship with Vietnam, as this dispute over the high seas crashes destructively onshore. “We have been here more than 20 years,” he said. “But there are a lot of things to figure out.”Additional reporting by Julie Zhu
248;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-05-16T13:38:08Z;Apple supplier halts production in Vietnam;;Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that manufacturers iPhones and iPads for Apple, is shutting operations in Vietnam for three days because of the anti-China protests that have erupted over the past week.Sino-Vietnamese relations have deteriorated sharply since China started drilling for oil in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands – which China controls and calls the Xisha – in the South China Sea.The latest tensions in the South China Sea have spilled into the commercial realm as factories supplying everyone from Walmart to Nike shut down after local mobs ransacked factories near Ho Chi Minh City in protest over China’s move.Yue Yuen, the world’s biggest sports shoe maker that supplies Nike and Adidas, resumed production in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday for the first time in three days. But while calm appeared to have returned to many riot-hit areas, factories are worried that violence could erupt again on Sunday when government-sanctioned anti-China protests are expected.“Foxconn has taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees following recent developments in Vietnam,” the company said.China’s foreign ministry said that two Chinese citizens had been killed in the protests, which started on Tuesday around Ho Chi Minh City in the south of Vietnam.On Thursday, a top Chinese general blamed the US “pivot” to Asia for mounting tensions in the South China Sea that have sparked the anti-China riots. Speaking in Washington, General Fang Fenghui, chief of the general staff of the Chinese military, said the US should hold an “objective view” of the disputes.“Certain countries are attempting to gain their own interest because they believe China is now developing its economy and the US is adopting this Asia-Pacific rebalancing strategy,” Gen Fang said at a press briefing at the Pentagon.Gen Fang blamed Vietnam for the tensions, which sparked a stand-off between Chinese and Vietnamese ships. He said China was drilling within 12 nautical miles – the territorial waters – of Triton Island in the Paracels. China has controlled them since 1974 following a brief conflict with Vietnam, but Hanoi still claims the islands.“The related countries in the South China Sea region have drilled actually many oil wells in the South China Sea, but China has never drilled even one,” said Gen Fang. “From this single fact, we can see how much restraint China has exercised.”Speaking alongside Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Fang said China could not understand why it was being singled out for criticism.“We don’t quite understand why there are no comments from the outside when other nations are drilling so many oil wells in the region, but when China starts to do the drilling, we instantly become a threat to the region,” said Gen Fang.James Clad, a former top Pentagon official, said China had drilled in the South China Sea before, but in undisputed areas, just as other countries have done. But he said drilling within the “nine-dash line” – far from the Chinese coastline and within other countries’ exclusive economic zones – was at odds with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) that China has ratified.On Friday, Le Luong Minh, secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations who is Vietnamese, told the Wall Street Journal that it was important to “get China out of the territorial waters” of Vietnam to ease the crisis. His comments went beyond the neutral remarks Asean leaders made at a recent summit.Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Friday said there were 63 Vietnamese ships near the rig, but refused to say how many Chinese vessels were there.China has become increasingly assertive over the past five years in its maritime territorial claims. Its neighbours are concerned about the so-called “ nine-dash line”, a demarcation on Chinese maps that envelopes most of the South China Sea, and suggests that China is laying claim to the whole area. The US recently called on China to clarify the meaning of the line for the first time.While Xinhua, China’s state news agency, has been releasing reports in English, censors have issued a near-total ban on domestic media reports in Chinese, so most ordinary people in China have no idea what is happening in Vietnam.Asked why there has been virtually no reporting in Chinese media, Ms Hua referred the question to the Communist party’s propaganda department, which does not answer questions from international media.The riots in Vietnam have also affected Japanese and other businesses. Japan’s external trade organisation said there had been minor damage such as broken windows at business parks where Japanese companies have factories. Japanese schools were closed and several companies, including Hitachi and Olympus, said they were suspending non-essential business trips to Vietnam.On Friday, Samsung, which is a large investor in Vietnam, and Canon, the Japanese camera maker, said they had no plans to halt operations in the country.Additional reporting by Jamil Anderlini, Wan Li, Ben Bland and Jonathan SobleTwitter: @AsiaNewsDemetri
249;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Upwardly mobile - pop-up stores rise to retail challenge;;Standing inside a converted shipping container, Paul Hurley, the founder of Dum Dums Donutterie, talks customers through his range of gourmet doughnuts.Mr Hurley sells varieties including Almond Crème & Pistachio (£3) and Crème Brûlée (£1.80) from his “donutterie” in Boxpark – a temporary shopping mall housed in containers piled atop each other, near a busy road in Shoreditch, on the fringe of the City of London.After three week-long stints in Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, last year and early this year, Mr Hurley acquired a space in Boxpark. On its first day there, Dum Dums sold out. Now, the niche company has a deal to sell doughnuts in Harrods.Mr Hurley’s leap from east London to the upmarket department store via a shipping container is a story that could be repeated across the UK, as “pop-up stores” – the temporary conversion of an empty space into anything from a commercial outlet to an art gallery – become a mainstay of retail life. They allow entrepreneurial merchants, designers and artists to raise their profile, generate business and try out an idea before permanently taking the plunge.“They have become not just mainstream but normal,” said Dan Thompson, an artist and author of Pop Up Business For Dummies, who has been involved in the concept for a decade.The number of pop-ups in the UK has rocketed, although – due to their temporary nature – official figures are hard to find.“It’s easily at 1,000 in London, if not 10 times that,” said Nicholas Russell, chief executive of We Are Pop Up, a start-up that acts as a marketplace, matching people who want temporary space with those who can rent it.Their rise is partly because pop-ups provide an elegant solution to a persistent problem: empty shops.In a world of high business rates, expensive long leases and the growth of online shopping, many traditional outlets have been abandoned. In London, almost 20 per cent of shops are vacant, according to Deloitte professional services. This figure rises to almost a third in northwest England.Landlords are liable for business rates when a store lies empty – doubling the misery for those left with empty shops. “It is bad enough not receiving rent,” said Mark Rigby, chief executive of CVS, a business rates specialist. “But then you get a double whammy: you are not receiving rent – but also paying business rates.”Pop-ups provide a cheap and handy alternative. At first popular with independent retailers and niche start-up brands, they were also the ideal antidote to Britain’s “ clone town “ high streets, adding something different to a shopping trip.Critics argue that the concept is being hijacked and commoditised by big brands, and is becoming another part of the standard retail repertoire.For independent merchants, however, pop-ups provide a chance to sell in a proper retail setting. While the rise of websites such as Etsy – which lets people sell arts and crafts over the web– has made it easy to become an online merchant, roughly 80 per cent of retail spending in the UK still takes place in physical stores.“When you don’t have a retail presence, it’s very difficult for you to understand a retailer’s point of view,” said Sam Farmer, who sells a range of gender-neutral toiletries aimed at young adults. Mr Farmer took part in a pop-up on the King’s Road in Fulham. Now, his wares are stocked in Space NK, the upmarket cosmetics retailer.Companies such as We Are Pop Up have emerged to help make the process easier. The business has attracted backing from the likes of Arts Alliance, which backed Lovefilm and Lastminute.com, as well as UCL Advances, the venture capital arm of University College London. We Are Pop Up is not the only one to attract big investment. Sir Charles Dunstone, the billionaire founder of Carphone Warehouse, was one of the backers of Boxpark in Shoreditch.But as big financial backers have started eyeing the category, so have big brands. At Boxpark, independent retailers sit alongside Nike and Puma. Even The Guardian has joined the action, launching #guardiancoffee last year, where Londoners can buy a £2.70 flat white and flick through the newspaper on an iPad.The emergence of multinational involvement has provided ammunition for critics who argue that pop-ups have been taken over by large corporates wishing to sprinkle a hint of “edginess” on decidedly mainstream brands.“In practice, pop-up shops – and pop-up culture – are a flailing attempt by tired brands to inject youth and vigour into something that consumers are bored of,” said Dan Hancox, a leftwing writer and author of The Village Against The World.However, not everyone dislikes big names such as Nike opening pop-up shops.“I love the fact that we have brought big brands down to the level where they have to pay attention,” said Mr Thompson.
250;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-05-15T12:25:08Z;Vietnamese mobs ransack foreign factories in anti-China violence;;Factories making goods for consumers around the world have been forced to halt production in Vietnam after protesters ransacked plants as maritime tensions in the South China Sea spilled into the business world.Mobs on Tuesday attacked scores of businesses at a Singapore-run industrial park near Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam. The violence has prompted many foreign factories to halt operations as a precaution.Yue Yuen Industrial, the world’s biggest sports shoe maker, which supplies Nike, said it was not affected but had suspended production in Ho Chi Minh City as a precaution. Li & Fung, the world’s biggest sourcing company, said some of its suppliers in Vietnam halted production on Wednesday as a precautionary measure.On Wednesday evening, the industrial zone’s management said police and security guards had “re-established security control”. It said 99 tenants had been hit by the protests and that four Chinese and Taiwanese factories had been set on fire.The attacks, in a country like Vietnam whose economic strategy is pinned to foreign investment, highlight the effect of a spat between China and Vietnam over disputed parts of the South China Sea.They have echoes of violent protests against Japanese companies in China in 2012 related to a separate dispute over the Senkaku Islands– which Beijing claims and calls the Diaoyu – in the East China Sea. Chinese consumers boycotted Japanese products and attacked Japanese businesses, hitting companies such as cosmetic maker Shiseido to Toyota.The Vietnam protests have been sparked by the latest spat between China and one of its neighbours over disputed waters in the resource-rich South China Sea. Chinese and Vietnamese ships are engaged in a stand-off near the Paracel Islands. Vietnam last week sent dozens of vessels to the area after China moved a deep-sea oil rig to the waters, which are claimed by both countries.Vietnam allowed protesters to demonstrate outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi at the weekend, but the factory attacks have increased anger towards China. The government deployed riot police on Wednesday.One official cited by Vietnamese media said some of the affected factories were South Korean or Taiwanese and that peaceful protests had been exploited by “extremists” who set fire to at least 15 factories.Crystal Group, one of Asia’s biggest clothing companies, which has operations in Hanoi in the north of Vietnam, said it had no plans to suspend production. But it said it was assessing the situation to ensure that its employees were safe.The Chinese embassy in Hanoi urged Chinese company staff to be on guard for protests. Xinhua, China’s state news agency, reported that Tran Van Nam, a top official in Binh Duong province where the attacks occurred, said the government was “determined to suppress those who force others to take illegal actions”.Singapore on Wednesday said it viewed the issue “very seriously given our close economic co-operation with Vietnam” and had asked the country “to restore order urgently”. It summoned Vietnam’s ambassador to express its concern.The Vietnam Singapore Industrial Park in Binh Duong is seen by foreign investors as a rare success story in Vietnam and has attracted dozens of factories from South Korean, Taiwan and Japan. Earlier on Wednesday, the park’s management sent an email to tenants advising them to suspend operations, saying, “we believe the current crisis in VSIP and Binh Duong is not improving” and added that it could turn worse.Tension in the South China Sea intensified on Wednesday after the Philippines accused China of breaching a regional code of conduct by reclaiming land on a disputed reef for the possible construction of a runway.Additional reporting by Julie ZhuTwitter: @AsiaNewsDemetri
251;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-05-06T14:18:28Z;Manchester United: devils in the detail;Investors may find themselves footing the bill for new players this summer;Manchester United plays its home football matches in the Theatre of Dreams. At the end of a poor season, desperate fans of the Red Devils expect the club to spend heavily on new players. These dreams will cost money. Investors are likely to get the bill.Barring a late season surprise, MUFC will not play in any of the European competitions. Crucially, it is set to miss out on next year’s lucrative Champions League. MUFC’s annual revenue from European competitions has averaged £37m in recent years. No European tournaments means less time on television. MUFC sponsors such as Nike will get less exposure and therefore pay the club less. A seventh place finish will also reduce league merit payments. Revenues could easily fall by £45m next season, though some of this will be offset by new sponsorships.Uefa, football’s international governing body, sets limits to how much any team can spend on players relative to the club’s revenue. In the near term, MUFC players’ wages could double without breaching these limits. But this would crush profits, causing concern with the club’s creditors and shareholders. MUFC will already spend more than £21m this year just to service its £285m of net debt. Most important, cash flow after capital spending would go into the red, requiring additional funding. The cash gap could amount to well over £50m, even with expected increases in sponsorship next season.Failure to spend on new players risks the Manchester United brand and erosion in sponsorships. The Glazer family, which controls the company, prefers to fund the club with other peoples’ money. So barring a very large new sponsorship pact, new financing is likely. Adding more debt is a possibility, but there is significant leverage on the club already. Equity investors should remain on their toes.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
252;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-05-05T14:56:58Z;Wearables industry ponders next step in fitness after Nike move;;"Nike's decision to stop developing its FuelBand fitness-tracking bracelet last month sent shockwaves through the wearables industry.While more futuristic devices such as Google Glass have attracted much of the attention in the nascent wearable technology market, most of the sales so far have been of fitness-tracking wristbands from Nike, Jawbone and Fitbit.If the one of the world's largest sportswear companies cannot make a success of a health-monitoring wristband, what hope is there for the dozens of start-ups who have been developing similar devices?But Nike is not giving up on digital health altogether; it is redeploying its efforts away from hardware towards apps. ""We are focusing more on the software side of the experience,"" Nike chief executive Mark Parker told CNBC last week.Nike does not want to compete in the hardware business against Apple, long rumoured to be working on an 'iWatch' with health-tracking features, and Samsung, whose Gear Fit wristband can track its wearer's steps and heart rate.Julia Hu, chief executive of fitness tech start-up Lark, came to the same decision more than a year ago.The $160 Lark wristband and its accompanying smartphone app was being sold in Apple Stores and proving successful in curing customers' insomnia without drugs, she said, but the device was also becoming a constraint. Customers got frustrated with things like Bluetooth pairing and forgot to wear it – a common problem with these sorts of wristbands.The sophistication of Lark's device was also limited by size and power requirements.""Because they care about battery life so much, wearables have forsaken the granularity of data,"" she says. ""That is why wearables basically can only tell you how many steps you did today.""So Lark stopped working on the hardware and instead created a new smartphone app, which tracks walking and running without the need for a separate wearable device. Based on the data it collects, Lark suggests tips for getting healthier, for which it charges a monthly fee.Samsung has bundled the app for free with its new Galaxy S5 smartphone, which contains a motion sensor similar to that used in the FuelBand, Jawbone's Up and Fitbit's products.""I think the definition of wearable sensors needs to radically change,"" says Ms Hu. ""I think the ultimate wearable sensor is your phone. Instead of spending $100 on a wearable, maybe you'll spend a few bucks a month to get motivation and coaching to get fitter.""A wild array of new wearable technology was the talk of the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, as both established companies such as Sony and Samsung, and a multitude of start-ups, propose ever more inventive and surprising ways to augment the human body with sensors and displays.MyFitnessPal, a popular online diet-tracking service, last week also added step-counting to its app for the iPhone 5s, which like the Galaxy S5 contains a dedicated motion-sensing chip.""We see it almost as a gateway drug to understanding the benefits of tracking your health,"" says Mike Lee, chief executive of MyFitnessPal, which has more than 40m registered users.Faced with competition from such apps, some fitness device makers are putting more emphasis on their software, while others are looking to create more sophisticated wearables.""The sensors and the hardware are nice, but they are table stakes,"" said Andrew Rosenthal, Jawbone's platform manager, said in an interview in March. ""Helping people track information is important but not sufficient. What really matters is helping put the data in context and driving behaviour change.""Venture-capital investors are still funding new health app start-ups. Last week, Index Ventures and Forward Partners invested $3.3m in Big Health, the London-based developer of Sleepio, an app that treats insomnia by analysing data collected by wristbands such as Jawbone Up.However, with Samsung and Apple looming large, some investors are becoming more cautious.February 2014: Samsung has relaunched its smartwatches alongside the much-hyped Galaxy S5, signalling a focus on smart wearables by tech’s heavyweights.""Wearables might be a little bit overheated,"" says Jeremy Conrad, co-founder of Lemnos Labs, an incubator for hardware start-ups in San Francisco, saying he might only back products catering to small niches. ""Wearables are hard but done right could be huge.""One start-up looking to raise money, Montreal-based Carré Technologies, is focusing on the high-performance end of the market. Its Hexoskin product integrates sensors into a shirt and can track an athlete's heart rate, rhythm, steps taken and breathing patterns. Canadian skiers used it when training for the Sochi Winter Olympics.Beyond such niche cases, some in the tech industry believe that most people will be more comfortable using apps on their phones, rather than wearing or carrying yet another gadget.""These devices are asking to share real estate on my body,"" says Lenovo's chief technology officer, Peter Hortensius. ""They're asking to share my face, they're asking to share my wrist. Are people going to do that? That's a very personal thing.""Lenovo is testing wearable devices in its labs but is waiting to see how the market develops before releasing anything.""I'm not clear what the winning wearables solution is, so we're going through some very interesting experiments right now to figure that out,"" Mr Hortensius says. ""We don't think it's imminent that it's going to be a mass, mass volume thing so we're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is."""
253;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-24T13:34:33Z;Chinese factory told to reimburse striking workers;;A local government in China has determined that the world’s largest manufacturer of sports shoes which supplies Adidas and Nike should reimburse striking workers for underpaying their pension contributions over many years.Thousands of workers at Yue Yuen Industrial, which also supplies Asics, Puma and New Balance, have been on strike for 10 days in the southern city of Dongguan over claims that the company has not been paying the legal level of contributions.In a survey conducted by its official trade union, Dongguan government said Yue Yuen should reimburse workers who had claimed that it had calculated pension contributions as a percentage of their base wage instead of total income.The scale of the strike in Dongguan, a huge manufacturing hub across the border from Hong Kong, has been unprecedented, with as many as 40,000 employees refusing to work on some days. The dispute comes at a difficult time for Dongguan, as the city’s image has recently been tarnished by an anti-prostitution campaign.Last weekend, Yue Yuen said it would start paying pension contributions based on total pay, but the offer has not convinced many employees. While the Dongguan government view echoes the company’s own proposal, experts said it was a rare example of a Chinese trade union actually trying to help workers.“This official response . . . creates an important precedent,” said Li Qiang, director of China Labour Watch, which obtained the document. “Unpaid social insurance is a pervasive issue in most Chinese factories, including suppliers to major international brand companies.”Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, another rights group, also welcomed the move, saying that while trade union documents tended to be pro forma, “this one does at least try to address the actual issue”.“The Dongguan trade union federation is to be commended for taking the issue seriously and looking for solutions. The company too seems to be engaging in good faith,” said Mr Crothall. “But at the same time, we have heard the police presence around the factory is increasing and there is more pressure on workers to accept the deal on the table. Looks like the authorities are using both carrot and stick.”Two labour activists who were monitoring the situation were detained by authorities this week. Zhang Zhiru, head of the Chunfeng Labour Dispute Service Centre in Shenzhen, was released on Thursday after being held by state security agents. His colleague Lin Dong was detained by police and has not been seen since Tuesday.Meanwhile, Adidas has started shifting orders away from the factory in south China to minimise the impact of the strike, but it stressed that it was “not pulling out” of the Dongguan facility. Nike and Asics did not respond to requests for comment. Puma said none of its products were made at the Dongguan plant.The Dongguan unrest comes as the balance of power in the labour force gradually shifts away from factories which are finding it harder to hire workers. Demographic and social changes have made young Chinese less willing to work in factories, while social media and smart phones have made it easier for them to compare conditions and move to a better job when they are unhappy with one factory.In recent months, Walmart and IBM have both faced strikes in China. A Toyota spokeswoman on Thursday confirmed that there had been a small strike at one of its suppliers in Guangzhou, but that the issue had been resolved by Thursday.June 2013: As wealth and consumerism reach China’s most remote cities, foreign brands are venturing far from Shanghai and Beijing hoping to win over millions of new consumers. The FT’s Patti Waldmeir visits two lower tier cities in central China and looks at how Adidas is expanding in the far outposts of the Middle KingdomAt Yue Yuen, George Liu, executive director, on Thursday said some production lines were operating again. But activists and workers said the strike was continuing as many employees refused to accept the offer.“The factory has a black heart. We are asking for the money that belongs to us,” said one worker. “We didn’t ask them for anything extra. They set up the factory to make money, but we left our homes to come here to work and make money too.”The Yue Yuen workers claim the company has not been paying the level of pension and housing allowance contributions required by Chinese law, saying payments should have been based on total pay. Most factory workers earn much more than their base pay because of overtime and other remuneration schemes.Yue Yuen says regulations are vague on how contributions should be calculated, but several labour experts said base pay was not supposed to be the standard.Jonathan Isaacs, a Chinese labour law expert at Baker & McKenzie, said Chinese law and local regulations made clear that factories in Dongguan should not be using base pay as the basis for calculating pension contributions.An administrative notice from the Dongguan government makes clear that this is the case, and the Dongguan union survey appears to reach the same conclusion.Additional reporting by Julie ZhuTwitter: @AsiaNewsDemetri
254;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-23T02:14:38Z;China sports shoe factory halts production as strike escalates;;The world’s largest sports shoe manufacturer, which supplies Nike and Adidas, has been forced to halt production at a huge Chinese factory after thousands of workers continued to protest yesterday over pay and benefits.Yue Yuen Industrial, a Hong Kong listed-company that produces one-fifth of the world’s athletic shoes, has faced labour unrest at a factory in Dongguang where employees have been on strike since April 14.George Liu, executive director at Yue Yuen, which also supplies Puma, Asics and New Balance, said 40,000 workers had to stop work after protesters disrupted efforts to restart production at one complex. He said the factory was unsure how many were aggrieved and how many were responding to peer pressure.The factory complex in Dongguan, a manufacturing metropolis in Guangdong province’s Pearl River Delta, is facing disruption over claims that Yue Yuen has for years failed to pay the correct amount of social security and housing allowance contributions required under Chinese law.The strike comes as the balance of power in China’s labour market gradually shifts from manufacturers to workers because of demographic and social changes that have made it harder for factories to hire workers. In recent months, IBM and Walmart have faced strikes in China over issues including pay and conditions.But while factories often face protests in China, the size of the Yue Yuen strike is unprecedented. “It is important simply because of the sheer scale,” said Geoff Crothall at China Labour Bulletin, a workers rights group. “It does make it rather unusual.”The workers say Yue Yuen calculated social insurance and housing contributions as a percentage of their base salary instead of total monthly pay, including payment for overtime and bonuses. In defence, Mr Liu said China’s nascent regulations were not clear on what standard companies should use for these calculations, saying “various regions have their own interpretation”.One Dongguan government official said companies should make contributions on the basis of total pay following the 2011 passage of a national social security law. But Zhai Yujian, a labour expert at Shenzhen University, said Guangdong already had regulations in place before that requiring the basis to be total pay.June 2013: The FT’s Kathrin Hille reports on the fate of a US factory owner being held hostage by his employees in Beijing over a labour dispute.Mr Liu said Yue Yuen had already been planning to change the calculation method from May, before the recent unrest, to reflect the increased competition for workers.On Sunday, Yue Yuen said it would respond to the grievances by agreeing to base contributions on total pay from May. It also said it would backdate owed payments, and provide an additional monthly living allowance of Rmb230 ($37).But the offer has failed to quell the protests, which continued through yesterday. Mr Crothall said “the fact that they have not ended the strike suggests that there is a trust issue”. Mr Liu conceded that the company had to do a better job explaining its offer to its employees, but added that seminars had been disrupted by protesters.Chen Jun, who has spent 10 years working at the factory, said workers were continuing their strike because they did not believe the company had met their demands.“The factory has been deceiving us for too long,” said Mr Chen. “They are sometimes partially transparent and sometimes completely non transparent, so we cannot trust them at all.”Lin Dong, of Chunfeng Labour Dispute Service Centre, an NGO in Shenzhen, said the workers had not accepted the proposed solution because they wanted a clear definition of the amount that would be contributed in future.“The workers feel the factory has been lying to them all along,” said Mr Lin. “The factory has been procrastinating over their request, which has not helped solve the problem. The workers feel the factory is insincere as they have been kept waiting.”Yue Yuen said it was taking contingency measures to reduce the fallout. It has other factories in China as well as in Vietnam and Indonesia.Adidas said it was “closely monitoring the situation” at the Dongguan factory. Nike said it was “concerned by the events” and was monitoring the dialogue between the management and workers.Twitter: @AsiaNewsDemetriAdditional reporting by Julie Zhu
255;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-22T17:35:21Z;Moyes pays the penalty for Glazers’ misstep;;"The manner of David Moyes’ sacking as Manchester United manager tells much about how, when it comes to matters of pure football issues, the Glazer family has lost its way with its prized asset.His departure is perhaps the worst moment in the nine-year tenure of the family whose stewardship has been resented by many fans since the club’s 2005 takeover.It comes at a time of relative financial stability, despite continuing protests by fans at the amount of money taken out of the club by the Glazers to finance the takeover – and it makes the family once again a focus of their discontent.The Glazers for years fretted about the end of the long, successful regime of Sir Alex Ferguson, which helped them survive their unhappy relationship with fans, and the succession issue.They entrusted to Sir Alex the task of choosing his own successor and gave Moyes a six-year contract, hoping these two acts would soothe worried fans by promising a continuation of the dynastic culture at Old Trafford that has brought the club so much success.In the aftermath of several of United’s many defeats this season, members of the club’s hierarchy were at pains to offer Moyes their backing and stress the family’s long-term outlook, saying the manager needed time.They admitted they lacked a plan for last summer’s transfer window, when the club missed the opportunity to renew an ageing squad, but said a new strategy was in place and Moyes was closely involved.But that strategy is now in shreds. In 37 words, conveyed via Twitter, United announced the undignified end of the Moyes reign after 10 months.The announcement bore immediate fruit in one arena, with United’s shares rising 6 per cent in New York to close at $18.78.The most pressing task for Moyes’ successor is to ensure that United, after failing to qualify for next season’s Champions League, does not suffer the same indignity two seasons in a row.Missing out on Champions League qualification will probably cost United £10m-£12m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. However, that is comfortably manageable for a club that is projecting ebitda for the year to June of £128m-£133m and revenues of £420m-£430m. “A bump in the road,” is how one insider described it.The club points to its commercial clout and its ability to maximise the power of its brand with a series of regional marketing deals across the world. In the second quarter it made £30.3m in pre-tax profits, thanks to a near-20 per cent increase in commercial revenues.It can look forward to the first full year of its record-breaking shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors, worth $559m over seven years. It is also in long-running negotiations with sportswear giant Nike over its new kit deal, which could be worth $100m a year.And with falls in gross debt and net finance costs, the club is better geared than at any time in the Glazers’ regime. In 2007, two years after the £790m leveraged buyout, net debt to ebitda was at 8.2 times. This year it is forecast to fall to 2.3 times.The club may be a robust enough machine to navigate a bump in the road – but it will not want too many more bumps ahead.Andrew Hill: Five lessons from Manchester United’s Professor MoyesOne observer said: “They can’t afford to be out of the Champions League beyond a year; it is just plain rubbish to pretend not. No sponsor would commit to that.”The club recognises the potential impact of substandard seasons and Champions League qualification failure.There have been some suggestions, denied by the club, that the season’s on-pitch travails have weakened its hand in kit supply negotiations. United has certainly been in discussions with Nike’s rivals, but remains bullish about signing a favourable deal.According to Tim Crow of Synergy, a sports sponsorship consultants, United’s strong global fan base should enable it to swallow a bad season.The biggest short-term impact of the club’s poor form could come from being unable to attract sponsors coming new into football. “They will inevitably look first at the hot team, which will certainly benefit [Premier League leaders] Liverpool,” he said.“Some fans in the Far East, who research shows are swayed by success, therefore will defect over time if success doesn’t return.”More vulnerable could be the club’s transfer dealings. Wage inflation and competition for players is intensifying. The wage bill in the second quarter rose 16.7 per cent to £51.6m. The days when United could expect players to come knocking at its Old Trafford gates are over.Esteve Calzada, former chief marketing officer at Barcelona, said: “If you could choose playing for Barcelona in the Champions League or for Manchester United in the Europa League, you would choose Barcelona. But United is still a strong and attractive brand to go to. It may just cost them extra money.”Manchester United’s strong income position should enable it to manage the impact of the miserable run of form that has forced the sacking of Moyes.But another substandard season will not only test the resolve of sponsors and players. It will further embolden the club’s rivals on the pitch. After dominating English football for 20 years, United’s ascendancy would then truly be at an end."
256;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-21T17:53:35Z;Nike’s FuelBand runs into trouble;;The race to dominate the nascent wearable technology market is already witnessing early stumbles, even before a potential winner has finished limbering up.Nike is considering pulling its FuelBand device out of the competition ahead of Apple’s entry later this year. Following a report on tech news site CNET, Nike confirmed it was laying off staff from its digital sports team and refused to commit to future device launches, although it insisted the FuelBand remained an “important part of our business”.Health-tracking gadgets from the likes of Nike, Fitbit, and Jawbone measure how far the wearer walks or runs in a day, the vigour of a workout and the quality of their sleep. Such devices have been tipped as the next big thing in technology after the smartphone, yet some think Apple will trounce them all when it launches its much-anticipated “iWatch”.Sources familiar with Nike’s plans say it will focus on making apps instead of the higher-priced but lower-margin FuelBand hardware, after growing an online community of 20m people.The company’s decision is complicated by the longstanding partnership and board relationships between Apple and Nike. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has served on Nike’s board since 2005, and in 2006, the two companies announced a partnership with the Nike+iPod product.The move follows Fitbit’s recent recall of its million-selling Force product after thousands of complaints that the wristband caused skin irritation. That, in turn, echoed Jawbone’s 2011 recall of its fitness wristband, Up, due to faulty hardware.However, Nike’s withdrawal marks the first serious test of whether technology, sports or fashion companies will dominate wearable devices, which have so far seen more hype than substance. Analysts say that Nike conceding defeat in hardware could send a warning to other fashion brands considering joining the race.The field is still wide open in the fitness tracker market, which analysts at IHS predict will reach $2.3bn in revenues by 2017, through cumulative device sales of 250m over the next five years.NPD, a researcher which tracks sales in general retailers but not from in-house stores such as the NikeTown, put Fitbit as the clear leader of the $330m US market last year, with Nike lagging behind in third place.Ben Bajarin, a technology analyst at Creative Strategies, says consumers quickly tire of the simple activity data that today’s devices offer.“For wearables to succeed, consumers will need to find value in the data the device is recording,” said Mr Bajarin. “Apple is setting up the iPhone to be the centre of this wearable accessory ecosystem.”The early activity tracker in Nike running shoes allowed information on a workout’s time, distance and calories to be shown on an iPod screen. Eight years later, the $150 FuelBand offered broadly similar capabilities, with overall activity measured in the company's proprietary “NikeFuel” points.Meanwhile, Apple’s so-called iWatch, expected to launch later this year, is rumoured to track much more detailed fitness information, including heart rate and even blood health.An accompanying app dubbed “Healthbook” will collect information from other sources in a single Apple service, much like the iPhone’s existing Passbook digital wallet for tickets and loyalty cards, according to reports.Market-watchers have said that the longstanding relationship between Apple and Nike would be tested by this coming collision between their products.As our Digital Sport priorities evolve, we expect to make changes within the teamNonetheless, the collaboration between the two companies has ostensibly remained strong. Nike launched a new motion-tracking app onstage alongside Apple at last year’s debut of the iPhone 5s.The question-mark over the FuelBand’s fate will serve as a warning to other clothing brands that had hoped their experience in fashion or fitness might win out over the current crop of wearable devices, which have often been criticised for poor aesthetics or comfort.It also highlights the complexities of hardware manufacturing for non-tech specialists, especially in wearable technology.A Nike spokesperson said it would change the looks of the latest “SE” version of the FuelBand, with new colours, but would not commit to updating the underlying hardware.“As a fast-paced, global business we continually align resources with business priorities,” Nike said.“As our Digital Sport priorities evolve, we expect to make changes within the team and there will be a small number of lay-offs. We do not comment on individual employment matters.”Nike added: “The Nike+ FuelBand SE remains an important part of our business. We will continue to improve the Nike+ FuelBand App, launch new METALUXE colours, and we will sell and support the Nike+ FuelBand SE for the foreseeable future.”Apple declined to comment.Nike’s move could avoid a stand-off similar to the conflict Apple faced with Google a few years ago. Google’s then-chief Eric Schmidt left Apple’s board in 2009 after its Android smartphone software came into closer competition with the iPhone. Apple responded by ejecting Google Maps from its devices. “Nike, which is arguably one of the longest-running participants in fitness devices, is getting out. What does that tell us about prospects?” said Jan Dawson, tech analyst with Jackdaw, on Twitter. “If it was selling well enough, they’d keep selling it. Suspect it isn’t.”Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin and Elizabeth Paton
257;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-14T16:32:32Z;Bigger, better brands;How has Sports Direct moved its branded products from the ‘good’ to the ‘best’ category?;Lonsdale is not usually mentioned in the same breath as Gucci or Burberry. But a few years ago, Sports Direct’s best-known brand faced a threat similar to that encountered by the Italian fashion house in the 1980s, when its logo was devalued by overeager licensing, or the British luxury group in the early 2000s, when its distinctive beige-check was adopted by “chavs” and football hooligans.Sean Nevitt, head of buying, says Sports Direct’s executive team realised around 2009 that “literally everyone” owned one of its blue Lonsdale hooded sweatshirts. They had moved the brand into too many areas: “We learnt from that and thought ‘We can’t let that happen again’.”The episode is symptomatic of the care Sports Direct now takes with its brand management. How it runs properties such as Lonsdale, Dunlop, Slazenger, Karrimor, Everlast and Sondico is a core strength. But one of its challenges is to ensure that its own-brand strategy does not antagonise important third-party suppliers such as Nike and Adidas.Its recent handling of the Dunlop and Karrimor brands is a case study. Karrimor, associated with climbing and hiking equipment, was also the brand used for Sports Direct’s safety range (such as steel-toed boots and heavy-duty jackets).But the group thought Karrimor was too thinly spread and chose instead to play on Dunlop’s association with heavy-duty tyre manufacture and apply that brand to the safety range.Mike Ashley, the founder, Mr Nevitt and Karen Byers, head of retail, conceived the commercial idea, and delegated it to a small team, who took three to four months to develop it, testing early ideas through the website.Meanwhile, in a similar process, Sports Direct took Karrimor upmarket in the hiking footwear range. It used another brand, Campri, for its “good” walking shoes, and Karrimor for its “better” and “best” ranges.It now aims to sell a pair of top Karrimor boots at about £90, significantly less than the third-party brands such as Scarpa and Merrell, but with similar claims to technical superiority. Dave Forsey, chief executive, says some highly specialist brands welcome the proximity of Sports Direct’s “best” range because they believe it expands the market and encourages enthusiasts to trade up to their equipment.In a research note issued last month, Goldman Sachs estimated that 50 per cent of Sports Direct’s retail sales were generated by its own brands, but more than three-quarters of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.The bank said it expected the company’s drive to sell more “better” and “best” products to increase margins further – and to give the company a big advantage as it tries to push up its share of the European market.The relationship with Nike, Adidas, Puma and other top third-party suppliers means, however, that the group needs to strike a delicate balance.Sports Direct works closely with these brands on store design – a strategy Ms Byers describes as “premiumisation” – staff training, and commercial plans. Teams from the big third-party brands are located at the Shirebrook head office, for instance.Sports Direct’s expansion into fashion retail – through the acquisition of the USC and Republic chains– was partly intended to offer a further outlet for the high-end leisure footwear and clothing lines promoted by Nike and others.But when it comes to developing its own brands, Mr Forsey acknowledges that Sports Direct establishes more of a buffer zone between its brands and those of Nike, Adidas and Puma than with some other high-end brands.Even so, Goldman describes the danger that third-party brands will limit supply as a “key risk” for the retailer and there is occasional tension: Adidas, for instance, is still refusing to allow Sports Direct to sell Chelsea FC’s 2014-15 kit– a stand-off which Mr Forsey describes as “ridiculous”.
258;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-14T16:18:30Z;How Sports Direct won a place in the premier league of retail;The group’s expansion has brought its unusual management style into focus;Sports Direct has no official outpost in Verbier. But most weeks in winter, Mike Ashley, the sporting goods retailer’s mercurial founder, rewards small groups of top-performing staff with a stay in his chalet, complete with private chef. The association of the upmarket Swiss ski resort and the value-driven chain – with its racks of discounted trainers and tracksuits – feels unlikely. But the chalet perks are emblematic of the group’s unorthodox management, inbuilt contradictions and extraordinary ambition.How Sports Direct moved its branded products upmarketSports Direct has become one of Britain’s fastest-growing retailers by harnessing the experience of a group of long-serving senior executives to the energy of its youthful staff, some of whom benefit from generous incentives and exceptional autonomy. Through its stores – 400 in the UK, 260 in the rest of Europe – its website, and its clever handling of its brands such as Dunlop and Karrimor, Sports Direct has gained enormous influence in a growing market, even with big suppliers such as Nike or Adidas.A more than twentyfold share price increase since 2008 has propelled Sports Direct into the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip UK companies. But it is dogged by mutual misunderstanding between investors and executives about governance and how the company works.As the group smartens its shops and service and pushes into new territories, will the idiosyncratic Mr Ashley and his team be able to keep the low-cost reputation that helped Sports Direct annihilate rivals? Or will expansion stretch its “wafer-thin” management model to breaking point?Work-hard, play-hard cultureIn hard hat and steel-toed shoes, Karen Byers, Sports Direct’s head of retail, is explaining how the group operates at its new Oxford Street store in central London, while keeping an eye on contractors refurbishing the cavernous former theatre around her. The pace is unrelenting. The previous night at 10pm, Ms Byers called the project manager’s home from the store to insist he demolish a wall to create a new children’s section.“I pride myself on my people: we work hard to make sure the staff work hard,” says Ms Byers.That ethos comes from the founder. Mr Ashley “works hard and has fun and he expects other people to work hard and have fun”, according to one former executive. The former squash coach started with one shop in 1982 when he was 17, backed by his parents. Meetings about store design used to be held in the Ashleys’ kitchen. His mother Barbara designed a ballet dancer motif that until recently could still be seen in older stores.Mr Ashley himself is press-shy. He would not speak to the Financial Times for this article and since a flurry of media appearances after listing the shares in 2007, he has had a higher profile as the billionaire owner of Newcastle United football club than as Sports Direct’s executive deputy chairman, the unorthodox title he holds. He takes no salary, but the board recently proposed an incentive plan to grant him up to £70m worth of shares, infuriating institutional investors, then scrapped it. Sports Direct’s aggressive expansion has prompted probes into alleged anti-competitive practices– all eventually dropped.But people who know Mr Ashley say he remains indispensable for his insights and obsessive eye for detail, particularly in the back-office retail arts of sourcing, supply chain and inventory management, which he assesses with the help of statistics analysts he refers to as his “stattos”.Sports Direct still operates, though, like a family business, run for more than 20 years by the same close-knit team. They include Mr Ashley, Ms Byers, Sean Nevitt, head of buying, and Dave Forsey, the chief executive. Mr Forsey says his “primary function is to protect Mike, [not involving him in] things where we are going to get less out of him. We use our time with him on the more challenging topics”.This senior group – sometimes augmented by others such as Mike Ashley’s brother John, who runs information technology, and Niall Sutherland, head of ecommerce – crams a week’s worth of meetings into three intensive days at the group’s 70-acre head office site near the old Derbyshire colliery village of Shirebrook. It is common to find them debating web-buying or brand strategy over a drink in a company-owned hotel in the early hours of a weekday. They then fan out across the business to implement what has been agreed.Zero-hours contractsThe footsoldiers in Sports Direct’s army of 20,000 UK staff are some 17,000 casual workers, mainly in stores and the Shirebrook warehouse (where all signage is in English and Polish, for the benefit of the many eastern European workers).Unite, the union, expressed concern last year about the treatment of rank-and-file Sports Direct staff, including the extensive use of “zero-hours” contracts, which have no set minimum hours. Sports Direct executives see the use of casual workers as necessary, however. One person who has worked closely with the company says the message is: “If you work hard and do well, we will reward you with a bonus, but if you just want to take a wage and don’t contribute, you will be on a zero hours contract.”As Sports Direct has matured, however, it has recognised that undertrained staff could undermine it. Malcolm Dalgleish, a former non-executive director, says the group does not aspire to be like John Lewis, the employee-owned retailer known for its service, because it competes on price. But it is trying to improve performance with training.Above the 55,000 sq ft store at Shirebrook, Sports Direct runs a training “academy” in collaboration with Nike and Puma, complete with mini-AstroTurf penalty areas to try out products, a giant training shoe and a statue of the Greek goddess Nike. On a recent visit new store managers – in Sports Direct manager strip of blue and red short-sleeved shirts and tracksuit bottoms – were undergoing a two-week induction course. It is not all classrooms and flipcharts: downstairs, Sports Direct also bloods recruits in practical skills such as how to handle pre-dawn stock deliveries.Juicy incentives for someThe opportunity for promotion meshes with other perks, including tickets to events and the opportunity to meet sporting stars. Last year the bonus scheme the company established in 2009 paid out about £75,000 in shares to a typical full-time employee on a £20,000 annual salary. Mr Forsey says the scheme has helped full-time staff retention. One Shirebrook employee says the recent share peak has “blown us out of the water – we are loving it. When it hit 900p, that [was] amazing – it’s all down to us.”The bonuses are based on group results. Mr Forsey says when Mr Ashley changed group branding to SportsDirect.com in 2007, “we just said, look, if we make less in the stores and we make more on the web overall we’ll do better as a company so let’s all target ourselves on group numbers”.The fact the current scheme covers only 3,000 staff risks an “us-and-them” culture. But Ms Byers – who got her break after selling Mr Ashley a pair of jeans when managing a store he later bought – says most of her area managers were originally part-timers.Autonomy at a tender ageThe group offers a degree of responsibility to teams of young employees at head office unusual in UK retail. As head of buying, Mr Nevitt insists his team members learn about stock control first. Contrary to retail orthodoxy, he does not run separate teams of buyers, merchandisers and allocators of stock. Everyone is responsible for all aspects of a product range: “We don’t run it like a relay race, where someone can drop the baton.”“It’s an incredibly flat structure – it’s pancake flat”, says Norman Pickavance, a board adviser who was brought in by Mr Forsey last year to review Sports Direct’s commercial operations. Teams are urged to experiment and if they “make a mistake, move on”, an approach that echoes Facebook’s “move fast and break things” maxim. “It creates a culture with a lot less fear and trepidation than with an organisation that’s trying to get it just right,” he adds.Early warning systemSports Direct has a network of specialist stores: it owns 51 per cent stakes in Swimshop, a swimwear website, for instance, and jodhpurs-to-jump poles retailer Robinsons Equestrian, and has close links with Soccer Scene, the Carnaby Street football specialist. Critics say this creeping control is obliterating independent sports shops, but it enriches Sports Direct’s expertise. The group tries to give managers of these companies responsibility for the same category within the business as a whole or uses them as an early warning system for customer trends.Shortly after Sports Direct started collaborating with Soccer Scene, the family owners were invited to share their insights with the group’s football strategy. Assuming Sports Direct, with its high market share, must have a reason for not selling goalkeeper pants, the Soccer Scene team asked why. “I said, ‘Because we’re idiots’,” recalls Mr Nevitt. “And now we sell 25,000 pairs.”The challenge aheadA note by analysts at Liberum has identified 1,000 stores with total sales of €2bn as possible targets for Sports Direct in Europe. But expansion will put the Sports Direct management style to the test.Norman Pickavance, board adviser, fears the “wafer-thin” top management could be overstretched, particularly if any of the top team are unable to continue. One of the senior group, Bob Mellors, chief financial officer, has stepped down due to ill health. The finance function is easily reinforced but building deeper management takes time.Dave Forsey, chief executive, says “having too many layers” can suppress information: “Retail, as well as being detail, is normally hard work and lots of issues and you need to know about those issues quickly.” Instead of adding bureaucracy to the group, he says he is strengthening the “bench” of potential successors below the senior team, bringing on existing staff and integrating the second generation of managers from family businesses it controls.Mike Ashley’s own position poses a threat, however – not only because of the “key man” risk created by Sports Direct’s dependence on him. Sports Direct’s recent purchase of small stakes in retailers Debenhams and House of Fraser unsettled even some of his fans. The group’s shares have fallen almost a fifth since he sold £200m worth of his shares this month. The company has also just scrapped its second attempt to link his performance to the award of up to £70m in stock – after being rebuffed by institutional investors.Weak corporate governance was already a problem in the wake of the 2007 listing, when the share price slumped. At the time, Mr Ashley attacked the City’s “cry babies” and predicted Sports Direct would reward investors who stayed put. It has. Malcolm Dalgleish, former director, says the group and its founder have “gone from zero to hero”.But by the standards of most FTSE 100 companies, Mr Ashley still operates with minimal constraint from the board. Jonathan Pritchard, analyst at Oriel Securities, says the group’s disclosure has improved since the early days when the only data in public documents “was the phone number of head office”, but there remains a “mistrust” of the City. This is fine in the good times, he says, but if performance were to wane, even in the short-term, Sports Direct could once again find itself with few friends.If that happens, it seems likely Mr Ashley himself would not care. He would fall back, as he always has, on a tight-knit group of associates. Mr Forsey, who worked as a Saturday assistant in Mr Ashley’s first shop in the 1980s, says the entrepreneur “will always be unhappy with what we’re doing, [is] underwhelmed pretty much constantly with the performance, and challenges everything”. The obstacles ahead are higher than those the founder and his friends have cleared. But as Karen Byers, his loyal head of retail, says: “At Sports Direct, your destiny is up to you . . . Your skill and will [moves you] on to where your destiny is.”

Coca-Cola shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.90 while PepsiCo fell 0.5 per cent to $83.47.Nike climbed as analysts at Stifel Nicolaus lifted their rating to “buy” from “hold” following the company’s 10 per cent retreat on Monday.Analyst Jim Duffy said the recent declines as well as lower earnings estimates had made investing in Nike shares more attractive.“Stand-out fundamentals in combination with correction in both the consensus numbers and relative multiple leave us more constructive on the risk-reward for Nike shares,” Mr Duffy said.Across Wall Street, analysts have trimmed their 2015 earnings expectations by a dime over the past four weeks to $3.36 per share, which takes forecasts closer to Nike’s guidance. The shares advanced 2.9 per cent to $72.92.Tesla shrugged off recent weakness, rising 3.8 per cent to $215.46, after announcing it would begin leasing its Model S to businesses.The programme, which will be run through a finance subsidiary, will allow small and medium-sized businesses to purchase the car with the right to return it for resale after three years.Gigamon, the manufacturer of network traffic management software, fell by a third after the company said it would miss its first-quarter sales guidance.The company blamed a transaction with a customer that did not materialise, crimping its results.Sales for the three months to March 29 are expected to be in a range of $31m to $31.5m, as much as 11 per cent below its forecasts.“While we are disappointed in these preliminary results, we remain confident in our business strategy and the market opportunity,” said chief executive Paul Hooper.Shares in Gigamon fell 33.9 per cent to $17.31.BlackBerry advanced after a Florida jury ruled in its favour in a lawsuit accusing it of infringing on patents.The lawsuit, brought by Dutch semiconductor company NXP in 2012, alleged BlackBerry phones and the company’s PlayBook tablet infringed three patents related to design and data transmission.NXP said it would explore its options for appeal. BlackBerry shares climbed 1.3 per cent to $7.96.Overall, US equities struggled for direction for much of the day despite a rise in job openings and improving small business optimism.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,851.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up to 16,256.14. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 4,112.99.

The offering had been priced at $26 on Thursday night, more than earlier projections. GrubHub sold 4m shares in the offering, while selling stockholders offered another 3.4m for sale.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners for Friday’s offering. The flotation follows a busy first quarter for IPOs, with the average amount raised in the period reaching a record, according to data from Dealogic.The rise stood in contrast with a difficult month for the tech sector stalwarts, including Facebook and Twitter, which have each fallen more than 10 per cent. King Digital, the maker of Candy Crush, continues to trade below its offering price.Google A class shares, which carry minimal voting rights, ended the day down 4.59 per cent to $545.25, the second day of trading after a split to create a C class of stock which carries no voting rights.Amazon fell 3.25 per cent to $322.78 and Netflix shares were down 4.9 per cent to $337.31, as momentum stocks on Nasdaq were hit hard.A week long spotlight on the business of rapid fire stock trading also knocked down the valuations of the publicly traded companies at the heart of a debate over whether US stock markets are “rigged”.Shares in US online brokers suffered some of the largest losses on Friday as ETrade fell 7.83 per cent to close at $20.43, TD Ameritrade lost 4 per cent to $30.71 and Charles Schwab declined 4.79 per cent to end at $26.06.KCG, an algorithmic trading company that also executes orders on behalf of clients, lost 6.81 per cent to $10.47. Major US stock and derivatives exchange operators including Nasdaq OMX, CBOE and ICE also fell.The scrutiny of the US trading industry was prompted by the release of Michael Lewis’ latest book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.Elsewhere, CarMax, the largest US used-car dealership chain, slid after the company reported fourth-quarter results shy of Wall Street forecasts.The firm said sales rose 9 per cent to $3.08bn, led by a 7 per cent advance in same-store sales, compared to expectations for $3.18bn. Profits declined 7 per cent to $99m, or 44 cents per diluted share, nearly a dime below analyst forecasts.CarMax said it would lift its share repurchase programme by $1bn. Shares dipped 4.21 per cent to $45.56.Finish Line strengthened following a broker upgrade to ‘overweight’ from ‘equal-weight’ as analysts at Morgan Stanley called the company their “top small-cap idea”.The shares rose by 1.13 per cent to $27.16 as Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said the investment bank expects strong athletic footwear sales trends to continue through 2014, with Finish Line likely to benefit from exclusive Nike offerings.“Finish Line’s last quarter showed the company can deliver even in a very poor mall traffic environment,” Mr Sole said. “A strong new product pipeline and the continuing health and wellness trend should sustain Finish Line’s premium running footwear business through 2014.”Athletic footwear sales have like “troughed” as recent data points to an acceleration, Mr Sole added.First Solar climbed as much as 6 per cent before paring its gains on Friday to just under 2 per cent, closing at $69.72, as analysts at Citi lifted their price target on the firm.Analyst Shahriar Pourreza said the company’s outlook “remains robust”, raising his target on the firm to $87 from $63.“The company has already contracted/booked 75 per cent of the earnings in 2015 and 40 per cent for 2016 so material upside remains as business mix changes and First Solar continues to diversify globally,” Mr Pourreza said.Overall, US equity markets struggled for direction after the month’s non-farm payrolls report showed payrolls expanded by 192,000 in March. The figures were marginally below Wall Street forecasts.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.25 per cent to end at 1,865.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.96 per cent to 16,412.71. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent to close at 4,127.73.
261;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
262;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-04-02T15:05:59Z;CrossFit gets Reebok’s pulse up;The switch by the Adidas-owned brand to basic fitness activity is bearing early fruit;"In a disused logistics warehouse near the river Main in Frankfurt, men and women hurl medicine balls against the wall, perform dips on gymnastic rings, lift barbells and kettlebells above their heads, climb and jump ropes, all while sweating and shouting profusely.This is not a regular gym but a no-frills CrossFit “box”. There are no mirrors for men to admire their muscles and no spa in which to relax after your workout; a curtained cubicle suffices for a changing room.At first glance it seems an unlikely place for a mainstream sporting label to try to reinvigorate its brand. And yet for Reebok, CrossFit could provide much-needed salvation.The sportswear brand, owned by Germany’s Adidas since 2006, makes CrossFit-badged clothing as part of a broader alliance with the fashionable fitness movement.The partnership, struck as Reebok struggled to justify the $3.8bn Adidas had paid for it, amounts to something of a tightrope act. Reebok has had to avoid alienating fitness fans drawn to CrossFit’s edgy, spartan image, while co-existing with a network of entrepreneurs who have driven CrossFit’s rapid expansion (see box).It seems to be working so far. “We’ve seen this brand turn the corner,” says Chris Froio, Reebok’s vice-president of fitness and training.Reebok certainly needed a lift. It has been a near-constant headache for Adidas. Reebok’s footwear sales have lagged behind those of Nike, which replaced it as official apparel provider to American football’s top league, the NFL, in 2012. Adidas later unearthed financial irregularities in Reebok’s India business; it then had to take a €265m writedown a year ago, largely because of disappointing Reebok sales-growth projections.Amid these disappointments, Reebok decided to reposition itself as a “fitness” brand, rather than associating itself with conventional professional sport. Its managers alighted on CrossFit in 2009, when it was still a relatively niche fitness activity and little-known outside the US.The training regime centres on a series of exercises that change each day and are known as WODs, for “workout of the day”. They tend to last only a matter of minutes but are super-intense, typically involving a combination of movements such as squats, presses, pull-ups and push-ups, as well as aerobic activities such as rowing and skipping.Adherents have created CrossFit boxes in all manner of locations, from garages to car parks; they are famed for obsessing over their training and many follow a caveman-style Paleo diet. However, CrossFit’s popularity stems not just from the intensity of its workouts but also the sense of community that each box tries to foster. Jaime Andrews, one of the founders of the CrossFit venue near the river in Frankfurt, says conventional gyms are deeply antisocial by comparison.“People go to a fitness studio three times a week, they use the same machines . . . it’s the same every time they go in. You’ve got your headphones in, nobody is talking to anybody, and – especially if you are a woman – it’s pretty intimidating.”She says CrossFit fosters more of a family feeling. “If we don’t see someone for a week or two we send them a message asking: ‘Where are you’?”Perhaps surprisingly, given it involves heaving barbells loaded with heavy weights, CrossFit is hugely popular with women. Nor is it the preserve of the young. This diversity is appealing to Reebok. “The first time a woman lifts a barbell over her head, or does a dead lift, that is extremely empowering,” says Mr Froio.In 2010 Reebok agreed a 10-year partnership with CrossFit worth an unspecified sum. It includes sponsorship of the CrossFit Games, an annual series of gruelling events televised on ESPN, which has boosted Reebok’s profile in the US. The games feature a $275,000 top prize awarded to the “world’s fittest” man and woman. Rich Froning, winner of the men’s title for the past three years, is to CrossFit what Tiger Woods is to golf.As well as making CrossFit tie-in shoes and other clothing, Reebok has co-branded about 110 CrossFit boxes. Its headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts, boasts its own box, meanwhile, and almost half of employees there are active members.The association with CrossFit is not without potential pitfalls for Reebok, however. The high-impact exercises can cause injury, although the extent of this risk is hotly debated.Mr Froio says physical damage is generally a matter of bad coaching and impatience on the part of the participant. “That’s where we see most of the injuries.” He adds: “I don’t think CrossFit is any more dangerous than just about any other activity out there if taught correctly.”The brand also has to make sure that it does not spoil CrossFit’s underground vibe. Greg Glassman, a straggly-haired libertarian who developed the fitness concept in 1995 in California, has rejected overtures from private equity to take over the sport.Mr Froio acknowledges that there was concern that Reebok would ruin CrossFit. “We spent a fair amount of time debunking that, making sure our approach wasn’t to put this slick marketing angle on it, but to really live and breathe the culture.”Mr Glassman fiercely protects the CrossFit name but seems content with having a small piece of a fast-growing pie. That leaves room for entrepreneurs such as Ms Andrews and her partner Philipp Imbusch to build a business – and for Reebok to find a place in the CrossFit ecosystem.Stripping out currency fluctuations, Reebok’s sales in the final quarter of 2013 were 9 per cent up on the same period a year earlier – aided by CrossFit and tie-ins with two other fitness regimes. Peter Steiner, an analyst at Metzler Equities, says the CrossFit partnership was an intelligent move: “There are some positive signs and the new products are good.”In the meantime, the craze’s momentum shows no sign of letting up. Mr Imbusch says word of mouth from happy clients is the key: “People who go to class or the office and say: ‘Dude, I was at CrossFit yesterday, everything hurts, but it’s amazing’.”CrossFit: A laid-back fitness trendCrossFit has a decentralised business model. Box owners pay a $3,000 annual licence fee to become an “affiliate” and to use the CrossFit name. They must also pay $1,000 to become certified as a CrossFit trainer.But otherwise they are free to run their business as they wish. A variety of businesses have also moved in to serve the needs of box owners, from internet and payment support companies to nutrition and sports equipment vendors.Philipp Imbusch and his partner Jaime Andrews invested about €25,000 to set up a CrossFit box in Frankfurt last year. In six months they have signed up 100 clients.Mr Imbusch is a former officer in the German army who also trains new CrossFit trainers. Ms Andrews is a former general manager in the international arm of Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer.Mr Imbusch says CrossFit’s back-to-basics approach has appealed to Frankfurt bankers keen for a break from the world of money.

The shares closed at $18.20, down 12.9 per cent.Mr Bennett, who had been in the post for less than two years, drove the software maker into new markets, including securing companies against data breaches.A person familiar with the matter said the board had been concerned about the product strategy Mr Bennett was undertaking, and especially as some product development leaders left to join the group’s competitors.Analysts at Jefferies downgraded Symantec from “buy” to “hold”, citing the prospect of exits by executives recruited by Mr Bennett and a lengthy search for a new chief.“Given the broad corporate realignment, product direction and sales model changes that are already under way from the strategy crafted by Mr Bennett – and supported by the board – we believe a search for a new chief executive could be lengthy,” Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz said.Nike shares slid after executives warned that currency swings would weigh on next year’s results, reversing gains following quarterly results after-market on Thursday.Chief financial officer Donald Blair said he expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales to grow at a “high single-digit rate”, below the company’s future orders rate.“This year’s devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year’s reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth,” he said.“We remain committed to investing in the strategies that are driving our growth. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2015 earnings growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range.”The comments countered better than expected third-quarter profits for the US athletics goods company and a 12 per cent rise in its order book to $10.9bn. Sales during the period, which runs to the end of February, rose 13 per cent to $7.0bn, also ahead of forecasts.Nike shares declined 5.1 per cent to $75.21.US utility Exelon led the S&P 500 higher after a broker upgrade from “neutral” to “outperform”.Analysts at Credit Suisse said many of the issues weighing on Exelon and other power companies – low natural gas prices, an absence of demand growth following the recession, and irrational bidding strategies by uneconomic power plants – were fading.“We believe expectations and fundamentals for competitive power have found a bottom, with the potential for a long-awaited recovery to take form over the next 12 months,” analyst Dan Eggers said. Exelon shares advanced 3.8 per cent to $32.55.Zions Bancorp was under pressure after it failed to maintain a minimum capital ratio of 5 per cent in the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests, the only bank of 30 tested to fall short.The test, which included a severe recession and unemployment above 11 per cent, showed Zions’ tier one common capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets falling to 3.5 per cent.The bank said it would resubmit its capital plans. Zions shares declined 5.3 per cent to $31.24.Visa led the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a federal appeals court reversed a lower-court ruling that allowed banks to charge retailers as much as 21 cents to process debit-card transactions.Shares in Visa rose 0.7 per cent to $223.37.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced for its fourth day in five, as analysts discounted comments by Janet Yellen that seemed to suggest that the Fed would raise interest rates sooner than expected.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,883.97, a fresh intraday record, but nudged down 0.29 per cent to close at 1,866.52.The Dow slipped 0.2 per cent to 16,302.77. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.98 per cent at 4,276.79.
264;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-03-20T23:11:37Z;Nike shares slip on 2015 growth forecast;;Currency headwinds, widening margins and cautious guidance for future growth triggered a 4 per cent slip in Nike shares during after-hours trading on Thursday, despite a better than expected third quarter.After modest declines in 2013, the world’s largest athletics brand surprised Wall Street by beating its initial forecasts, buoyed by strong demand in Europe and the US.But investors later reacted after Nike’s chief financial officer Donald Blair hinted that earnings per share growth rates in 2015 would be below “our mid-teens target range”, owing to unfavourable exchange rates and “demand development efforts” such as marketing expenses.Sales for the three month period to February 28 rose 13 per cent to $7bn. Net income fell 21 per cent from a year earlier to $685m, or 76 cents per diluted share, reflecting the sale of its Cole Haan and Umbro brands, which contributed $204m to last year’s figures.Analysts had predicted profits of $648m, or 72 cents per diluted share, on sales of $6.7bn. Future orders scheduled for delivery rose 12 per cent to $10.9bn.Despite greater China previously causing concern for the company thanks to an inventory glut and a product assortment that failed to appeal to local consumers, like-for-like footwear sales rebounded by 14 per cent to $467m. Flat apparel and equipment sales continued to weigh on Nike’s performance in the region, despite Mr Blair stating that “its reset strategy was working”.The company, which has a market capitalisation of $70bn, highlighted 12 and 28 per cent shoe sale surges in North America and Western Europe respectively for its robust performance in the quarter. The brand also enjoyed a swell in demand in emerging markets, where sales were up 19 per cent to $937m.Nike is winning new fans who prioritise style-focused athletics wear as everyday apparel thanks to a combination of pioneering technology and high profile fashion collaborations with figures like Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci.“Our strong results demonstrate our focus on delivering innovations that resonate with consumers,” said chief executive Mark Parker. “We are focusing on the biggest opportunities for growth while we manage risk across our diverse global portfolio,” he added.In an increasingly crowded marketplace, Nike continues to outpace arch-rivals Adidas, Puma and Reebok as well as newer contenders like Lululemon Athletica and UnderArmour.The company partially attributes this to its heavy investment in “demand creation expenses”, spending $733m in the quarter on its marketing, endorsement and sponsorship strategies - an increase of 18 per cent. Nike attributed these costs to product launches and the upcoming football World Cup. It equipped both Super Bowl teams earlier this year, and is reported to be on the brink of signing a 10-year, $1bn deal to outfit Manchester United.The Nike share price has soared by 48 per cent in the last six months. The stock is currently trading at 24 times its forward earnings.
265;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-03-11T18:57:05Z;Hedge fund reveals 2.5% Man U stake;;US fund Baron Capital has taken an overall stake of 2.5 per cent of Manchester United after buying up one quarter of all the publicly traded shares in the Premier League champions.A Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealed the New York investment company had built up a position of 9,581,636 shares.The Glazer family, owners since 2005, only made 10 per cent of shares publicly available on the club’s flotation in 2012.A note on the Baron website about its holding said that United’s shares had dropped in value in the fourth quarter because of delays in the signing of a new global merchandising deal with Nike and the team’s substandard on-pitch performances.United lies sixth in the Premier League, and has an uphill task to qualify for next season’s Champions League. Failure to do so would damage TV income in the next financial year.Baron said: “The Nike deal is still expected to be signed, but has been pushed out from this fiscal year. We remain positive on the company’s prospects going forward.”United shares are down 5.7 per cent over the past 12 months but have enjoyed something of a revival since they hit a 52-week low of $14.26 in late February. At lunchtime in New York, shares were trading at around $15.80.In a trading update last month, United said its league position was “disappointing” but dismissed concerns about the possible impact of failure to quality for the Champions League on commercial revenues. United are predicting 2013-14 revenues of £420m-£430m.
266;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-02-05T23:26:33Z;Under Armour: undented;The brand relies on weekend warriors – and they are fickle;Are high-flying consumer-products companies dynamic innovators or simply clever marketers? Athletic apparel maker Under Armour is the latest case study. In the late 1990s it created advanced T-shirts to run and jump in – they are supposed to keep competitors warm, cool, or dry depending on weather conditions (its creatively titled fabrics now include “Heatgear”, “Coldgear”, and “Allseasongear”).Last week it reported its 15th straight quarter of 20 per cent plus revenue growth, which sent its market capitalisation up $2bn to $11bn. But a brand that originally supplied cutting-edge clothes to star athletes increasingly depends on the whims of weekend warriors who will not sprint any faster, no matter how they dress. Cue the comparisons with Lululemon, the yoga-gear maker that also had a breathtaking ascent but came crashing down last year after a series of missteps.Since listing its shares in 2005, Under Armour’s revenue has jumped from $281m to $2.3bn. Tom Brady, the NFL star, is a celebrity endorser and it supplies various high-profile college and professional sports teams. By 2016 it expects to reach $4bn in revenues by diversifying into shoes, sports bras and gear for kids. The constant fear though is that consumers are fickle. Women once loved $70 spandex from Lululemon enough for its revenues, between 2009 and 2012, to rise from $350m to $1bn (its shares jumped 1,700 per cent). Coach was the affordable luxury handbag of choice until Michael Kors came along (after its earnings on Wednesday, Kors shares are up nearly 300 per cent since its 2011 IPO).To its credit, Under Armour has so far avoided any significant mistakes and is a credible rival to Nike. But with Under Armour shares trading at 57 times forward earnings there is no room for error. Investors should stay on the sidelines for now.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
267;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-01-16T09:13:28Z;Latest numbers on India’s fakes – are they for real?;;"From flash ‘Guchi’ trainers to fashionable ‘Caiwen Kelai’ boxers, Mumbai’s popular Chor Bazaar (meaning “thieves’ market”) can fulfil all your luxury desires. Often for less than Rs100 ($1.62) a pop.India’s market for counterfeit luxury goods is expanding at a compound annual growth rate of as much as 45 per cent, according to a new report from the the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. But some analysts reckon the numbers themselves lack the ring of authenticity.Assocham claims that counterfeits make up about 5 per cent of the market for luxury in India – a market reckoned by others to be worth more than $8bn a year. Assocham says the black market is growing twice as fast as the official sector.Apparently this is draining revenues from the formal luxury industry and could discourage global brands from doing business in Asia’s third largest economy. What is needed is quite obvious: enforcement of intellectual property rights and certification of authentic products, as well as education for the consumer.But is this really a big problem? Unlike other markets in southeast Asia, most consumers in India have very limited awareness of high-end brands.“More of the counterfeits would be of the mass brands – the Nike, the Reebok, the Adidas… a Tommy Hilfiger perhaps,” says Arvind Singhal, chief executive at Technopak Advisors, a retail consultancy. “But India doesn’t have an aspiration, as far as the middle income consumer goes, to be flaunting a Louise Vuitton handbag.”The people who are buying Rs100 fakes aren’t always choosing these items for the brand name emblazoned on the front and it’s hard to see the shoppers at Chor Bazaar depriving the real Gucci of much income.Assocham makes some other questionable claims. It identifies two big sources of counterfeit goods. First, it says, more than a quarter of fake goods sold in India are sold online. Second, 80 per cent of the produce is coming from China.On the first point, ecommerce still makes up only 1 per cent of retail sales in India (which were worth a total of $528bn in 2012, according to Ernst and Young). That isn’t nearly enough to pose a big threat. Besides, large websites such as Flipkart and Myntra dominate the online business and they have stringent rules on authenticity.As for imports, Singhal says most of the low value fakes you find in India are produced at home, simply because it isn’t worth the risk of getting hauled up at a border just to sell cheap goods to a tiny market.As India develops, however, consumers will surf the net and travel broad, learning about the high-end products they can’t afford. That’s when a handbag emblazoned with the letter ‘L’ and ‘V’ becomes an essential – even if it’s pleather.Related reading:

Known for her romantic, documentary-style photos, Bee started out chronicling her early teenage experiences and by 14 her work had been picked for a Converse campaign based on her Flickr photo uploads. Hermès was one of the first luxury labels to pick up on her with a dreamy short film “Il Est Pour Nous”. Other clients include Adidas, Fiat USA, Nike 6.0, Vice Magazine and Wieden + Kennedy, while she has appeared in numerous magazines. Bee was asked to photograph Roger Vivier’s autumn campaign in 2013, and recently shot Russian fashion maven Miroslava Duma for Vivier’s spring-summer 2014 Codes collection. Vivier brand ambassador Inès de La Fressange says: “Olivia takes photographs like real friends do: with gaiety and tenderness.

269;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Smartphones set to become even smarter;;"The revolution in smartphones is over. This year’s focus will instead be on step changes in technology that will help the devices play an even greater role in people’s lives.Sensors
Wearables and watches
Materials and screens
Camera
4G and beyondBetter processors and integrated applications will mean even smarter phones, not just in terms of sheer processing power but also in analysing and making use of the masses of data collected by the devices.Kicking off the fight for supremacy in the smartphone market this year will be the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where the following technologies and trends in mobiles will be on display.SensorsCrucial to many devices this year will be intelligent sensors that monitor the user, allowing smartphones to automatically react to their needs – even before they are aware of them.Sensors used so far in smartphones have been relatively crude, even if already numerous. The latest iPhone model, for example, includes a pedometer, compass, accelerometer, GPS and fingerprint scanner.Improved sensors will allow phones to act and react in a similar manner to Microsoft’s Kinect games console, which can understand hand gestures and recognise faces. Indeed, Nokia, which is soon to be owned by Microsoft, will make a much greater play of sensors this year in a revamped range of devices expected in the spring, according to people familiar with the company.Sensors will be able to detect temperature, pressure, eye movement and gestures, location and magnetic fields. In effect, the screens of premium phones will look back at the user and know when they are sleeping, walking, running or taking the bus; whether or not they are holding up one, two or three fingers or swiping away.Accenture, the consultancy group, credits advancements in microelectromechanical systems for the coming wave of smaller, more accurate, and more durable sensors.David Sovie, managing director with Accenture’s communications group, said: “Sensors will step into the spotlight in 2014 like never before, enabling the digital transformation of people and companies and feeding increasingly interconnected networks with insightful data.”Iris scanning is being planned by some handset makers, which will allow people to open the phone using eye contact rather than a password. This will also allow improved eye tracking for applications such as reading and web page scrolling. Sensors such as those for heart rate monitoring in wearable technology will also emerge this year, according to Canalys.Crucially, the phone itself will become more intelligent by learning from what it is tracking in the habits of the user. The phone will know who you are and what you are doing, and react accordingly having learnt from past experience.Luke Mansfield, head of product innovation at Samsung Europe, said: “2014 will see technology start to distil data, and provide even sharper insights, into something even more actionable that can help us make decisions about our health and wellbeing.”Wearables and watches
The proliferation of sensors will help wearable technology make the next step into mainstream use, with almost every major manufacturer lining up forms of mobile technology that can be worn on the wrist or elsewhere that will monitor activities and wellbeing on the move.Most devices will be companion accessories to a smartphone rather than standalone products, although at least two smart watches will come with SIM cards installed that will allow them to connect independently to the mobile internet.Most Android-based smartphone makers are planning to launch a smart watch, with Chinese makers such as ZTE already promising to bring down the prices with lower end alternatives. Apple, meanwhile, continues to work on the iWatch.There will be a variety of forms, however, as makers seek to differentiate products with different displays, including at least one with an e-reader format. Many primarily offer notifications and controls for the phone in the pocket.Many manufacturers are taking ideas already in the market – such as the fitness bands sold by Jawbone and Nike – and weaving them into wider applications where digitally connected people can log every aspect of their lives using their bands, watches and other wearable hardware.This move by smartphone makers into this “lifestyle” market could cause a dip in the fortunes of specialised wearable devices that only have a single use, such as fitness tracking.The wearable technology will also spawn new software applications – Ben Wood at CCS Insight has identified eight categories ranging from simple internet consumption and entertainment to the “quantified self” and “lifeblogging”.Juniper predicts significant opportunities for app developers across the health, fitness, sports and communications markets.Aesthetic appeal will become a factor, with analysts expecting a shift in fashion as “smart” clothes and other wearable products are embraced by designers. With wearables and applications able to track and predict habits, there will also be greater concerns around privacy.Materials and screensWith smartphones increasingly identical in appearance, some manufacturers will bring in different materials for higher priced versions.Phones will continue to be designed in various sizes and shapes. Companies such as LG and Samsung aim to bring out new versions of products with flexible or curved displays such as a sturdier version of LG’s G Flex range.Ceramics will also be adopted, in particular on the detailing. Industry executives say one phonemaker is preparing a phone made of a type of unscratchable material that is similar to the polycarbonate bodies already used by Nokia.Premium phones will typically use edge-to-edge screens, rather than a “bezel” rim encircling the screen.High definition display will become normal for even midrange smartphones, while the resolution on displays will improve considerably at the higher end. The first phones to feature ultra high-definition (so-called 4K) screens are expected before the end of the year. This will offer realism akin to high-end TVs, although the phones using such displays will sacrifice battery life and need to be capable of superfast 4G broadband to carry HD content. Companies such as Sony and Samsung with divisions already producing high-definition TVs will be at the forefront of these improvements.While better displays and sensors will consume more energy, smartphone makers will introduce bigger but slimmer batteries that will boost the life of many devices.CameraThe major manufacturers have slugged it out for the title of the best smartphone camera last year, with resolution and low light advantages at the forefront of much of the advertising. While Nokia’s Lumia 1020 boasts the highest level of megapixels at 41, it is also far from the easiest to use and does not always take the best pictures in the untrained hand.The fight continues into 2014, with Nokia and Sony expected to make the next steps into advancing lowlight camera quality. Samsung’s camera technology will also improve in its latest additions to the Galaxy range. There will be more made of the ability to “refocus” pictures after the shot, as well as the zoom quality, with smartphone makers taking aim at the compact camera market.Smartphone makers will aim to replace the “point and shoot” range of cameras with added ability to share pictures instantly over the internet – indeed, central to the camera phone will be the applications able to create so-called “life blogging” diaries using functions similar to cameras already on sale.4G and beyondManufacturers will this year bring 4G to even the most basic smartphones, meaning that superfast mobile broadband and all the resulting applications will be more accessible. While the first phones out this year from Sony and Samsung will boast impressive speeds, 4G will come as standard in the entry level, £100 phones by the middle of the year.This move will be supported by a shift to 4G chipsets such as those made by MediaTek, the Chinese component maker, that are cheaper without sacrificing experience.Meanwhile, the higher priced phones will be boosted with support for the so-called LTE Advanced standards capable of reaching 300 Mbps speeds that are being pushed by operators such as EE in the UK. Handsets capable of LTE Advanced are being planned for the second half of the year.There will also be more powerful, and again cheaper, chips becoming available that will boost the performance of more basic handsets.Better processors will better support the health and lifestyle apps and the range of clever sensors, enabling the smartphone to become a true mobile computing device."
270;NKE;Nike Inc;2014-01-01T05:04:22Z;Zuckerberg tops list of US philanthropists;;Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg topped the list of US philanthropists who opened their cheque books to make big donations in 2013, with his gift of almost $1bn to a Silicon Valley charity.Mr Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, his wife, gave 18m Facebook shares worth about $990m to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in December, nearly 30 per cent of the $3.4bn total given to charity last year.The gift – to a charity which works to support the neighbourhood where Facebook has its headquarters – marks the first time a philanthropist under the age of 30 has given the largest single donation. Mr Zuckerberg ranked second in 2012 behind Warren Buffett.Last year also saw a rise in the number of donations of more than $100m, with 14 US citizens including Michael Bloomberg and David Koch giving at least that sum, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which compiled the list. This compares with 11 who gave more than $100m in 2012.Stacy Palmer, the Chronicle’s editor, said the rise in large gifts was a sign of the improvement in the economy and the stock market. She said it made her “optimistic” that 2014 could be a strong year for philanthropy.“I think this is a good sign. I’ve noticed a lot of non-profits saying their end of year fundraising has gone well, which was not the case in the past few years when it was a real struggle,” she said.But gifts are not yet back to the level seen before the recession, with a total of $4.1bn donated in 2007.Mr Zuckerberg is “remarkably young” for such a large donation, which follows another gift of shares worth $500m to the same foundation last year, Ms Palmer said.“One of the things that is interesting about the Zuckerberg gifts is he is giving to a community foundation which supports lots of different causes, instead of setting up his own foundation in his name . . . like Gates, Carnegie or Rockefeller,” she said.Mr Zuckerberg’s donation comes at a time of tension between the technology industry and other communities in the Bay Area, some of which have protested about the affluent tech workers pushing up rents.Ms Palmer added other technology billionaires were also making large donations, often focusing on education or scientific advances, but many preferred to give anonymously.Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, and his wife were the second-largest givers in the US in 2013 with their pledge of $500m to the Oregon Health & Science University Foundation for cancer research.Mr Knight was followed by Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, who pledged $350m to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, to promote cross-disciplinary work and for student financial aid.Colleges and universities were the main beneficiaries of large donations in 2013 with 12 of the 15 leading gifts going to higher education. Charles Johnson, the financier, pledged $250m to Yale University for new buildings, while Stephen Ross, the real estate developer, pledged $200m to the University of Michigan.Other recipients included Stanford University, Columbia Business School and Tsinghua University in Beijing.
271;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-12-12T18:36:02Z;Sports Direct: kit and kaboodle;UK’s largest sportswear retailer in spat with Adidas;"One feels for Dave Forsey. The boss of retailer Sports Direct has kept almost everyone happy this year. A 24 per cent jump in first half sales suggests shoppers are happy to buy their trainers and tracksuits there. Staff have been treated to a £135m bonus pot (about £78,000 each). And shareholders have enjoyed a 76 per cent rise in the share price, even after a 10 per cent dip on Thursday after first-half results came in a shade below expectations.But there is always somebody who cannot be pleased. Adidas is refusing to let Sports Direct sell replicas of next year’s Chelsea home jerseys. It may be sore about being undercut on this year’s kit, available for £55 on Adidas’s website but £45 on Sports Direct’s. Spats between sports retailers and their suppliers are not new. A decade ago Foot Locker fell out with Nike, damaging sales at both, before patching things up. Foot Locker has recovered from the experience and Sports Direct should come through too. Only half of its sales come from third party brands, although Adidas is a big part of that.This is not a one-sided contest. Adidas is in trouble; it warned on profits in September. Annoying Mr Forsey may not be wise. Sports Direct’s pile-it-high-sell-it-cheap business model is not innovative but it is executed with aplomb. It has increased operating profits from £100m in 2008 to an expected £266m this year, destroying rival JJB Sports along the way. Now the company has set its sights on continental Europe. With net debt at 0.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, it has the firepower to make a big push.Shareholders who are not Chelsea fans can take the Adidas tiff in their stride. Valuation is of more concern. At 22 times forecast earnings, Sports Direct is priced like a company with lots of room to grow. A European repeat of its UK success is priced in.

I don’t have my watch.”Andy Murray’s first words after beating Novak Djokovic in the 2012 US Open final – ending Britain’s painful 76-year wait for a male Grand Slam singles tennis champion – were a little underwhelming, even by his restrained standards.But this was no ordinary timepiece he was scrambling around for – it was his $4,000 D-Star Automatic Chronograph made by sponsor Rado.Both he and the Swiss brand would have been relieved Murray found it in time to slip on his wrist before lifting the trophy. Murray fulfilled his obligations and Rado secured the pictures in the press it had dreamed of when tying the player down to a reported multimillion-pound endorsement contract.This type of product placement has taken on a greater role in the sports arena, reflecting a wider trend in the sport sponsorship industry where exclusivity and luxury are critical.Murray’s rival Rafael Nadal brought his own slant to the idea that “time is money” when he struck a sponsorship deal with luxury watchmaker Richard Mille that typifies this evolution in sport star-sponsor relations.The Spanish tennis world number one worked with the company to create a limited edition tourbillon timepiece: the RM27-01. Made from titanium and a lithium alloy used in aerospace and Formula One, it weighs just 18g – so light that Nadal wears it while playing.“Sponsors are looking at athletes and asking themselves, ‘How can we stand out? How can we structure a deal so that it is not just writing a cheque but more of a relationship with the athlete?’” says Jim Andrews, content director at IEG, a global sponsorship consultancy based in Chicago. “It is important to present something that is going to capture the imagination of the media and consumers.”The RM27 has certainly fulfilled the second aim: the first version of the watch sold out, and sales of the $690,000 limited second edition are reported to be strong.Richard Mille, the French owner of the eponymous company, is delighted at the effect Nadal wearing the watch on court has had. “[The public sees] that this is a watch that can go into battle,” he says.Simon Rines, founder of International Marketing Reports, a sports marketing analyst and publisher, says that when executed correctly, the luxury endorsement avenue can provide good value for sponsors. “The deal with Richard Mille appears to be a payment in-kind: the $690,000 watch. Typically, an individual of Nadal’s stature would be demanding $1.5m-$4.5m per endorsement,” he says.Buying a luxury watch has always been an expensive undertaking, even for wealthy individuals. Lesa Ukman, co-founder of IEG, believes watches have also benefited from recent technological developments. In an age in which mobile phones are ubiquitous, the primary role of watches – telling the time accurately – has diminished. The luxury end of the watch market has become “more image-intense than ever”, Ukman explains. “The decision to buy and wear a luxury watch, especially for men with limited clothing and jewellery choices, is a statement.”The US Open tennis itself is a world of luxury brands. The silver trophies given to winners are handcrafted over a period of five months by jeweller Tiffany & Co, which also sponsors the event. Ralph Lauren, the tournament’s official apparel sponsor, designs all the clothing worn by on-court staff. Carmaker Mercedes-Benz supplies the official vehicles for the tournament and transports the players, special guests and VIPs in a fleet of limousines and sports utility vehicles. Champagne house Moët & Chandon is also a US Open sponsor.Research by Kantar Media, the media analysis and research company, illustrates why the luxury sector sees certain sports as a good investment. Kantar found that in the UK, approximately one in four people earning more than £100,000 a year watched the US Masters, one of the major golf championships, compared with just one in 10 earning less than £30,000.Richard Brinkman, global head of sports at Kantar, says such data should not be taken in isolation. “While certain sports and events offer sponsors a natural platform to reach a luxury market, they also need athletes with the charisma to take advantage of it or, in sports with a relatively poorer demographic following, transcend it,” he says.These trends have not supplanted the ever-growing sponsorship sums from sports equipment makers themselves, especially for particularly charismatic individuals. Golfer Rory McIlroy, for example, this year signed a 10-year deal with Nike thought to be worth $250m. His brand stablemate, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, is being paid $9m a year to sport such designs as Nike’s CR7 Mercurial Vapor IX signature boot, whose design features a print of the vela supernova – exclusivity that is “out of this world”.
273;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-12-05T16:37:13Z;Gadget gifts that are not just for Christmas;;"With the holiday shopping season truly under way, this is the second of a two-part guide to some must-have gadgets with lasting appeal. This section focuses on devices that are mainly for use while out and about, along with a miscellany of some personal favourites.SmartphonesThese top more wish lists than any other gadget as they are both fashion statements and productivity tools.For me, Samsung’s Galaxy S4 is the best, with its big screen, powerful processor and digital photo capabilities. Best of all, but not uniquely, users can access a trove of apps to customise features to mould it to their needs.Apple’s iPhone 5s is a close second, and it is true that the slimmer iPhone is more comfortable to hold and Apple’s curated App Store represents a better experience. If brand is not an overriding factor, decent alternatives include Google’s Nexus 5.CamerasDSLRs, with big digital sensors and interchangeable lenses, represent the pinnacle of digital photography. For the ambitious amateur, two stand out: Canon’s EOS 70D and Nikon’s D7100. Both can deliver outstanding images, but neither is cheap. Sony’s Alpha SLT-A77 is an affordable alternative that still delivers.Not everyone wants a camera with changeable lenses. “Ultra zoom” cameras with extreme zoom lenses are a good alternative. My favourites are Canon’s SX510 and Panasonic’s Lumix DMC FZ70, which has a bigger sensor and boasts the longest zoom (60x) available, making it great for wildlife shots and sporting events.Among action camcorders for enthusiasts of outdoor activities such as cycling, surfing and snowboarding, JVC’s Adixxion 2 is rugged and waterproof with built-in WiFi; a good alternative is the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition.Wearable techFast becoming one of the hottest consumer electronics categories, wearable tech ranges from cameras, such as the Looxcie 3, that you wear around your neck or clipped to a breast pocket in what I call “first-person video”, to smartwatches and fitness and personal healthcare devices.Among the newest smartwatches, I like Samsung’s Galaxy Gear, which has a built-in wrist camera and works with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or Note 10.1 (2014 edition) tablet. A better choice if you do not already own one of those devices may be Sony’s Smart Watch SW2, which will work with any of the latest Android-powered smartphones. The Basis B1 smartwatch is a good choice if you are interested in health as it incorporates multiple sensors, including one that monitors your heart rate round the clock.Fitbit’s Force, Nike’s Nike+ Fuelband and Jawbone’s UP24 would all be welcomed by those seeking to track their fitness, while Garmin’s Forerunner is an excellent GPS-enabled sports watch for serious runners.MiscellaneousThe Livescribe 3 smartpen makes electronic versions of handwritten notes and, when paired with a tablet or smartphone, delivers them instantly to the screen. Phone Halo’s bluetooth-enabled Wallet TrackR fits in a wallet and alerts its owner via a paired smartphone if accidentally left behind. 3D Systems’ Sense 3D scanner and printer are the shape of things to come: the scanner captures 3D objects and the printer enables you to recreate them at home.Lastly, for pure fun: Google’s bargain Chromecast device lets users stream online video, music and other content to a TV using a smartphone, tablet or laptop running the Chrome browser; the Blade 350 QX RTF quadcopter is an ultra-manoeuvrable personal drone.Prices and value for moneyValue-for-money rating out of five; prices are a guide only; some items are not available outside the USSmartphones● Galaxy S4$550 (£410 in UK)● iPhone 5s$676 (£510)● Nexus 5$483 (£340)——————————————-Cameras● Canon EOS 70D$1,100 (£838)● Nikon D7100$1,097 (£719)● Sony Alpha SLT-A77$798 (£649)● Canon SX510$239 (£190)● Lumix DMC FZ70$243 (£291)● JVC Adixxion 2$272 (£277)● GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition$299 (£252)——————————————-Wearables● Looxcie 3$150● Galaxy Gear$295 (£210)● Sony Smart Watch SW2$170 (£150)● Basis B1$169● Fitbit Force$130● Nike+ Fuelband$150 (£125)● Jawbone UP24$150● Garmin Forerunner$130 (£105)——————————————-Miscellaneous● Livescribe 3$149 (£130)● Phone Halo Wallet TrackR$30● 3D Systems Sense 3D scanner and printer$1,300, $400 respectively● Chromecast$29 (£30)● Blade 350 QX RTF quadcopter$470 (£349)"
274;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-12-03T21:00:29Z;Wearable tech, 3D printers and Ultra TV: trends to watch in 2014;Wearable devices, 3D printers and Ultra TV will all be in demand;"In the fast-paced world of consumer technology, nothing is the same for very long and every year brings new innovation, themes and trends. So what surprises will 2014 bring? Here are three trends that I think will help define the consumer electronics industry in 2014.1. Wearable techSports gear makers, watch manufacturers and electronics companies are rushing to label their latest products “wearable tech”. The reason? Research confirms that wearable tech is one of the hottest tech trends around and likely to be a significant category in its own right in 2014.According to a survey conducted by Wakefield Research for software group Citrix, 91 per cent of Americans are excited about wearable tech – including watches (30 per cent), clothing (22 per cent) and glasses (19 per cent). In addition, most Americans (60 per cent) think wearable tech will be as common as smartphones, on average, in six years.The appetite for wearable technology has been primed by companies including Nike, Jawbone and Fitbit with their fitness wristbands (called FuelBand, UP and Fitbit Force, respectively). Typically, these are paired with smartphone apps to deliver some data analytics. For example, Jawbone’s UP24 app takes advantage of the device’s continuous feed of data, which includes how long you sleep, and how well.“Many wearable devices are currently companion devices to other smart devices, in particular smartphones,” says Oliver Rowntree, research analyst at Futuresource Consulting.Other companies including Google, with its Google Glass project, are exploring the potential of using technology to “enhance” reality, for example by providing additional information about the objects, people or scenes being viewed. Conversely, companies such as Looxcie and V.I.O. are offering wearable video cameras designed to capture real-time point-of-view video clips.Meanwhile Sony and Samsung have joined a handful of specialist companies delivering smartwatches designed to work with Android-based smartphones.Overall, Juniper Research estimates that smart wearable device shipments – including smart watches and glasses – will approach 130m units by 2018, 10 times more than this year.2. 3D Printing3D printing – or additive manufacturing, as it is more properly called – involves depositing successive layers of material to create a 3D object.Most 3D printers are currently used for building prototypes for the medical, aerospace, engineering and automotive industries, but with advances in digital technology, these machines are becoming smaller and cheaper – putting them within reach of consumers for the first time.Signalling this, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas will next month feature a “tech zone” devoted to 3D printing. Meanwhile, several companies including MakerBot and 3D Systems have begun offering 3D printers and scanners designed for consumers and hobbyists.3D Systems sells a simple scanner for $1,300 and recently rolled out a $400 handheld scanner called Sense, capable of scanning small and large objects, people and scenes. Similarly, MakerBot recently began selling its £1,790 MakerBot Replicator 2 desktop 3D printer and £1,190 Digitiser Desktop 3D scanner at the Science Museum shop in London.Prices will have to come down further before 3D technology finds its way into every home, but the direction is already clear.3. TV – the revolution continuesThe TV hardware industry was banking on 3D TVs to slow the decline in HD set pricing. It did not happen because consumers found the technology flaky, the eyewear associated with it uncomfortable and 3D content uninspiring. Today “3D-capable” is just another feature box to check. It turns out consumers are much more interested in “smart or connected TVs” capable of displaying content other than standard TV fare.But that has not stopped the TV-industry marketing machine ratcheting up the buzz around three new developments – “4K” or Ultra HD TVs, capable of displaying four times the resolution of current HDTV; OLED (organic light-emitting diode) flat screens that deliver exceptionably rich colours and deep, dark blacks; and curved panels designed to provide a more immersive viewing experience.The first Ultra HD began appearing 18 months ago but cost $25,000 or more. Since then Sony, Samsung, LG and Toshiba have all brought out 55in Ultra TVs with price tags around $3,500, while Sharp’s 70-inch LC-70UD1U costs about $5,000. Some also feature OLED and curved panels. Unfortunately, however, there is still very little Ultra TV or video content available, which may limit the appeal of these next-generation sets.Meanwhile it is a fairly safe bet that the “cord-cutting” trend – substituting video content delivered via the internet for traditional broadcast, cable or satellite services – will accelerate. Leading Over-the-Top (OTT) content providers including Netflix, YouTube and Hulu are likely to benefit. ABI Research forecasts that the OTT video market will grow from $8bn in 2012 to more than $20bn by 2015."
275;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-11-14T16:02:27Z;Jawbone fitness band aims to give apps a run for their money;The Up24 does a much better job than most monitors of nudging the user to be more active;Jawbone Up24 (rating:3/5)If any company looked poised to lead the nascent wearable technology market a couple of years ago, it was Jawbone with its Up fitness wristband and app combination. After all, the company began by making Bluetooth earpieces for phones – the original wearable tech – and boasts star designer Yves Behar as chief creative officer.Suddenly, pedometers were sexy.But soon after launching Up in 2011, Jawbone had to recall the device after it proved no match for the shocks of everyday wear. By the time it released an improved version a year ago, Nike had launched the rival Fuelband. Also wrist-worn, it offered constant wireless iPhone syncing over Bluetooth, while the Up had to be plugged into the smartphone’s headphone socket to transfer data. Other Bluetooth-based rivals, such as Fitbit, also gained in popularity.Now, with the new Up24 – on sale in the US only so far, for $150 – Jawbone is catching up by adding Bluetooth. In other respects, it closely resembles earlier versions, albeit with a new pattern on the bracelet’s rubbery surface. But why change when it remains the best-looking of the fitness bands? It is no bulkier than a digital watch, more flexible than the Fuelband, and comes in several wrist sizes. Unlike its rivals, the Up24 wristband has no step-count display, but that is what a smartphone is for and it does help prolong battery life to about seven days.The smartphone app has had an overhaul to take advantage of the device’s continuous feed of data, which includes how long you sleep, and how well. The app, which also works with the original Up wristband, has improved notifications celebrating milestones and providing “actionable” information, such as how far you have left to go to reach your goal when, say, you are leaving the office. Figuring out how to set my goals was easier than on rivals such as Fitbit’s app, but the latter makes it simpler to see progress at a glance.Up’s app provides a busy news feed of hints, charts and updates from any friends you might include to add competitive drive. That could be engaging or annoying (do I want to know my friend had a better night’s sleep than I did?).Such software enhancements are vital now that consumers can increasingly turn to their smartphones for fitness-monitoring information. Apple’s iPhone 5s includes a new chip called the M7, which tracks how the device is moved. That means apps can use the phone to track runs or just the number of steps taken more accurately than on older iPhones while also consuming less battery power.Nike is updating its Fuelband, also $150 (£125), but it is already taking advantage of the M7 with its free Nike+ Move app, which tracks activity even when the phone stays in your pocket (see below).Moves, another well-designed app, available on Apple and Android devices, can tell by the phone’s speed of movement whether you are walking, running, cycling or driving, and how far.So why bother with a wearable device?“[The M7 chip] is counting steps and we are counting steps,” admits Brad Kittredge, Jawbone’s director of product management for Up. But, he argues, an iPhone’s step counting may be less accurate if it is in a bag rather than on your person – and it cannot track sleep.Ultimately, I found that Jawbone’s Up app does a better job than most fitness monitors of nudging me to be more active, and its hardware wins on design. But for true fitness freaks, there are more sophisticated wearables out there, including the $199 Basis watch, Motorola’s Motoactv and Garmin’s Forerunner. In addition, $150 for Up’s Bluetooth pedometer seems expensive when a free smartphone app can recreate many of its basic functions.Planet of the AppsTim Bradshaw picks his favourite from the latest crop of apps.What it is: Nike+ Move, $2-$4, for iPhone 5s onlyWhy you should try it: Nike+ Move turns your new iPhone 5s into a simplified Fuelband. Moving about generates NikeFuel, a proprietary unit for measuring activity that you can compare against others or your own daily or weekly average. It also breaks down how long you have been running, walking or moving about in some other way. Just don’t cheat by shaking your phone to generate Fuel points.
276;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-10-23T21:37:47Z;Wembley designer outlet centre sets capital trend;;"When the red ribbon is snipped on Thursday at the London Designer Outlet, it will mark a milestone in the efforts of developers and civic leaders to rejuvenate the forlorn area around Wembley Stadium.Quintain, the developer behind the £100m shopping centre, will unveil 70 stores, a nine-screen cinema and 15 restaurants, all intended to make Wembley a place where visitors might come not just to see the big game but to linger in the aisles at Nike, LK Bennett, Superdry and other stores.For London, it signifies a larger trend: the arrival of the so-called “outlet centre” in the capital. These emporiums of discounted branded goods, which for LDO means up to 70 per cent off, have been spreading across the UK in recent years.Centres such as Oxfordshire’s Bicester Village have become tourist attractions in their own right, attracting large numbers of high-spending Asian visitors eager to lay their hands on its luxury brands.James Saunders, Quintain chief operating officer, said an outlet centre model was an obvious choice in view of the proximity of Brent Cross and Westfield, both a short drive from Wembley. “London is already well-served by full-price retail.”Developers previously blamed the city’s high property prices for the lack of schemes within the M25. But Neil Saunders, an independent retail analyst at research agency Conlumino, said Bicester Village had prompted them to look again at opportunities in the capital. “The economics may have changed; the perception certainly has.”Smaller-scale schemes have popped up elsewhere in London. The Croydon Village Outlet opened last month at the town’s former Allders department store, with 500,000 sq ft of space and designer brands discounted at up to 75 per cent. Marco Cash, the entrepreneur behind the scheme, said he wanted to create a “Harrods of the Southeast”.In east London, Hackney council last week gave planning permission for the Hackney Fashion Hub, a development of 60 retail units adjacent to the existing Burberry store, which attracts thousands of Asian shoppers every year.Backers of the 75,000 sq ft outlet cluster, due to open in autumn 2016, predict it will draw 3m visitors a year to Hackney Central, an area of the borough that has suffered persistent problems with low-income or workless households.Retail brands Aquascutum and Pringle are already in place near Burberry, and the “Hackney Shop” on Morning Lane provides a retail space for young local designers to sell their wares alongside established brands. The London College of Fashion has a campus nearby.Transport is one of the potential barriers to widespread growth in London. Shoppers at outlets buy more on average than high street consumers, so many prefer to travel by car rather than public transport.While Wembley has 1,100 car parking spaces alongside the new outlet, more centrally located locations might struggle. Mr Saunders of Conlumino said: “Bicester has the space to have car parking. London’s much more constrained in that respect. No one will know quite how it works out until we’ve run one.”"
277;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Rory McIlroy begins multimillion-euro claim against former agents;;Rory McIlroy, the former world number one golfer, has begun a multimillion-euro legal action against his former agents in a case that is shedding light on the lucrative industry of sports management.In Dublin’s High Court on Monday, Judge Peter Kelly agreed to fast-track Mr McIlroy’s claim against Horizon Sports Management, his former Dublin-based agent, in a dispute over fees and a breakdown of trust.The golfer is seeking the rescission of his “representation contract” with Horizon and two linked companies – Gurteen Ltd and Canovan Management Services – which have negotiated commercial deals for the Northern Ireland golfer worth about $129m over five years.Horizon and Mr McIlroy agreed the contract in late 2011 after the golfer, now 24, split with Chubby Chandler, his previous manager. Horizon subsequently negotiated a series of lucrative sponsorship and commercial deals with big companies including Nike, Omega, Bose and Santander.These contracts will earn Mr McIlroy about $50m this year and over five years will make him one of the world’s highest-paid sportsmen.Horizon was paid $6.7m in fees. The agent was entitled to 5 per cent of any pre-tax sums earned in prize winnings and 20 per cent of pre-tax sums earned from other sources such as sponsorship and appearance fees.Legal counsel for Horizon told the court the management company would launch a counterclaim against the golfer. This is expected to focus on $2.6m in fees that Horizon alleges it is owed and on other damages suffered as a result of the breakdown in the relationship.Last month Mr McIlroy confirmed he had terminated his contract with Horizon and formed Rory McIlroy Incorporated, a Dublin-based company which will have his father, Gerry, on its board.Mr McIlroy, who was not in court for the hearing on Monday, is being represented by Paul Gallagher, Ireland’s former attorney-general. He is expected to argue that the contract with Horizon is void, claiming Mr McIlroy did not receive legal advice before signing the contract and alleging it is in breach of competition law.If the case goes to a full trial next year, both parties are likely to allege breach of contract as they fight damages claims that could cost the loser tens of millions of euros.The terms of Mr McIlroy’s $20m per year deal with Nike and an amendment to his “representation contract” in March 2013 are particularly contentious.“Regrettably this legal action has been taken despite Horizon’s efforts to reach an orderly and fair resolution,” said Horizon in a statement issued on Monday. “This claim will be defended vigorously and comprehensively in legal process,” it added.A spokeswoman for Mr McIlroy said: “Rory’s terminated a contract which was an unconscionable bargain.”Mr McIlroy has had a difficult 2013, in which a dip in form caused him to slip to sixth in golf’s world rankings. And on Monday the Irish Independent reported that his long-term relationship with the Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki had ended.

280;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Adidas: in the bunker;German sportswear maker issues profit warning, but it’s not all bad news;Rory McIlroy is not having a good season on the golf course. A year ago the wunderkind from Northern Ireland finished second in the rankings. This year he did not even qualify for the end-of-season Tour Championship. But he is not the only one fluffing his shots. Adidas, the German sportswear maker, has cut its full-year net income guidance by almost a tenth, to between €820m and €850m. That sent its shares down 4 per cent on Friday. One of the reasons it cited was the poor state of the global golf market.It seems that golfers the world over are not stocking up on new drivers and irons. But that is not the only reason why Adidas revised its forecasts. Continued weakness in a range of currencies from the Russian rouble to the Argentine peso against the euro played a part. This is not surprising. Currency effects had already wiped 3 per cent off group sales in the first half from a year earlier. Adidas’ German rival Puma, which also books its sales in euros, is suffering too.More worrying for Adidas was a hiccup at one of its new distribution centres in Russia, its third-biggest market after the US and China. Its strength in Russia gives it an advantage that helps to offset the global superiority of its biggest rival, Nike. The US sportswear group commands more market share in all of its key markets and has operating margins of 13 per cent, nearly two-thirds more than Adidas. What is more, as Adidas moves away from its flagging Reebok brand, especially in the US, it is Nike, not Adidas, that is picking up the share.In the circumstances, it is not surprising that the outperformance of Nike extends to the stock market. Traditionally the share prices of the two industry behemoths track each other closely. But this year Nike’s shares have gained a third, more than twice as much as Adidas’s, with most of the gains coming this month. That has widened the valuation gap. Nike now trades on 23 times forward earnings, a chunky 60 per cent ahead of Adidas. The latter still has room to grow in China, and it is sponsoring most of the big teams in next year’s Fifa World Cup in Brazil. Like Mr McIlroy, Adidas should not be written off yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
281;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-09-15T13:53:13Z;When market movers are the index makers;Investors have outsourced much power to the index providers;Who has the power to move markets? Often some unlikely candidates.As everyone learnt during the global financial crisis, rating agencies had been given too much power. This was the side-effect of regulations that placed limits on the bonds that banks or fund managers could hold, based on their ratings. The result was to outsource due diligence to the agencies. This put far more weight on the opinion of one or two analysts than they were ever designed to bear.Another division of Standard & Poor’s also has far more power than was intended. Those who draw up stock indexes, in a world ever more driven by passive investment, have immense power. The world’s most powerful stockpicker, in effect, is the governing body of the S&P500 index, as some $2.14tn is tied to it.As with the reforms that overwhelmed the rating agencies, the moves that gave the indexers such power made sense individually. But judging by the way markets moved last week when several of the world’s best-known indices made slight changes, traders do not understand how the indices work.The most widely covered move last week involved the Dow Jones Industrial Average, still easily the world’s best-known stock index. On Tuesday, its governing committee announced it would remove Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America and Alcoa in favour of Visa, Goldman Sachs, and Nike, prompting a flurry of commentary about the changing face of corporate America, as well as a move to buy the new entrants. Goldman far outperformed BofA that morning, while both Visa and Nike enjoyed gains well ahead of the market.Should it receive such attention? Unlike past decisions to axe Woolworth or Eastman Kodak, the adjustments were not an attempt to remove incurable laggards (BofA and Hewlett-Packard are both recovering after bad times, while Alcoa is in a cyclical industry).Rather, the decision was made because the Dow is weighted by share price, rather than market value, and the three exiting stocks had low share prices, giving them minimal impact on the overall index. The same problem affected the entrants. Apple, the obvious replacement for H-P, would have distorted the index, as its $500 share price would have swamped all others.Thus this was an exercise in remedying the Dow’s technical inadequacies. Anyone serious about tracking markets would recognise those technical inadequacies as insuperable and ignore the Dow.On Wednesday, it was the turn of the FTSE 100, covering the hundred biggest London-quoted stocks. Unlike the Dow, the FTSE announces its quarterly timetable in advance. It was plain to anyone paying attention that ENRC, Serco and Wood Group would leave, while Sports Direct, Mondi and Hellenic Coca-Cola would join.This did not stop noticeable pops in the stocks of Sports Direct, a fast-growing UK sports retailer, and Mondi, a paper and packaging group, even though both had already enjoyed spectacular rallies this year on the road to gaining entry to the FTSE.And like the Dow, the FTSE 100 must be treated with care. As shown by the replacement of a Kazakh miner with a Greek Coca-Cola bottler, the index is a strange amalgam, bearing little relation to the UK economy. Its weighting in technology companies is just under 1 per cent (Arm Holdings and Sage), while more than a quarter is devoted to energy and resources plays. Few should want to base any investment decision on it – unless they are determined only ever to invest in sterling, avoiding any foreign exchange risk, and only to buy very large stocks.Finally, there came the S&P500. It announced late on Wednesday that two companies – Applied Micro Devices and SAIC – would exit, to be replaced by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Ametek, an electronic instruments group.AMD’s share price currently languishes where it did in 1981. It was the smallest stock in the S&P. Meanwhile, Vertex and Ametek were the largest stocks in the S&P MidCap 400, so their inclusion was logical. They still gained 2.7 and 5.7 per cent respectively at Thursday’s opening.S&P’s methodology is clearer than that of most peers, and it retains discretion over its exact membership, making it harder for traders to “front-run” changes. Its members are not the 500 biggest US stocks, but are adjusted to mirror the sectoral balance of the market as a whole. But this discretion creates controversy. Google joined years after many thought it should. And Facebook, a far larger company than Vertex or Ametek, is still excluded because it has yet to make a profit for four quarters in a row.So without meaning it, investors have outsourced much power to the index providers. Judging by this week’s market moves, they have done so without truly understanding what goes in to the indices they are tracking. This is not healthy.john.authers@ft.com
282;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-09-10T22:53:57Z;Netflix takes a starring role;;US indices were poised for a fifth consecutive day of gains, helped by Netflix, which broke through the $300 level to reach a record high.The content streaming and DVD service was up 6.4 per cent to $313.06 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley increased price targets for the company.Netflix is more than 238 per cent higher since the beginning of the year, having recovered from its low of $53.05 hit after a plan to split its DVD and streaming business was met with subscriber cancellations and investor scepticism.Netflix was not alone on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,683.99, with all 10 major S&P sectors posting gains.The industrial and financial sectors led the way, up 1.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. Another strong data release from China, this time indicating that industrial output, investment and retail sales had improved, helped to boost some of the largest US manufacturers. Vanguard Industrials ETF was up 1.4 per cent to $88.23.General Electric added 2.1 per cent to $23.87, Honeywell International gained 2.1 per cent to $84.13, and United Technologies ticked up 1.7 per cent to $106.26.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 per cent to 3,729.02, but was hampered by a sharp drop in Apple shares following the company’s announcement of its newest slate of iPhones.Apple, which traded slightly lower before the release event, extended losses to 2.3 per cent at $494.64, taking the company back below the $500 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 15,191.06.Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa all received a boost on news that they will be added to the Dow.All three companies moved sharply higher, with Nike up 2.2 per cent to $66.82, Goldman shares 3.5 per cent higher to $165.14, and Visa 3.4 per cent better to $184.59 after the news broke on Tuesday morning.Nike has enjoyed a strong run in 2013 for consumer stocks and posted strong earnings thanks to higher prices and cheaper materials.The sports apparel company’s shares are up 29.5 per cent on the year to date. The companies will replace Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard after the close of trading on Friday September 20.The three spurned stocks took the news in their stride, with Alcoa off 0.4 per cent to $8.05, Hewlett-Packard 0.4 per cent lower to $22.27, and Bank of America advancing 0.9 per cent to $14.61.Delta Air Lines rose sharply in its first day on the S&P 500. Shares in the carrier were up 4 per cent to $22.63 and are now up 13.8 per cent since Monday.Urban Outfitters and ConAgra were among the day’s worst performers on news they were in danger of missing earnings expectations.Urban fell 10.2 per cent to $38.35 after a regulatory filing showed that third-quarter same-store sales were below analyst estimates. The drop took the retailer into negative territory for 2013, off 2.6 per cent.ConAgra shares dropped 6 per cent to $31.54 after the company reduced its 2014 guidance.BlackBerry was off 5.1 per cent to $10.94, continuing a recent volatile run as sale rumours swirled around the handset maker. Reports on Tuesday morning said the company had laid off a chunk of its US sales force.Shares in BlackBerry are off 21.6 per cent in the past three months.Tuesday’s gains put the S&P 500 up 3.1 per cent during its September streak. However, it has been overshadowed by an even more impressive run from the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks.The Russell is up 4.4 per cent in September, taking it near its 2013 highs of 1,063.52.However, the US indices are not alone. In the past six sessions, Tokyo’s Nikkei is up 6.3 per cent, the Shanghai Composite has risen 6.7 per cent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is better by 3.6 per cent.
283;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-09-10T18:52:30Z;Goldman joins Dow in big stocks shake-up;;Credit cards, investment banking and running shoes are coming to the world’s most recognisable stock market benchmark, reflecting the shift in the US economy from industry to services and consumer goods.Visa, Goldman Sachs and Nike, three major companies with high equity prices, are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the select group of 30 companies that form one of America’s most well-known stock benchmarks.The trio replace Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard, marking a trend away from commodities, commercial banking and technology.The move is part of a shake-up designed to boost the relevance of the benchmark, in a year when the price-weighted Dow has lagged behind the overall performance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes were prompted by the low stock price of the three companies slated for removal and the index committee’s desire to diversify the Dow so that it more accurately reflects the shifting undercurrents of the economy.“I think this is an improvement in the Dow and makes it a better measure of the market,” said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “By putting stocks with higher prices we get a better indication of the market as well as of the economy.”“These higher-priced companies are a better reflection of the American economy,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. The move would probably bring a lot more attention to them, he said. “A lot of people know Visa as a credit card company, maybe less so as an individual stock.”A unique feature of the Dow is that the benchmark is price weighted, which means higher-priced stocks drive its overall performance, both up and down. This is one reason why very high-priced stocks such as Apple and Google are widely viewed as being unable to feature in the Dow, as their share of the benchmark would dominate its direction.Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said the new additions meant that based on current prices, Visa would become the second most important stock in the index and Goldman the third. The bank was among the strongest performers on the S&P 500 index on Tuesday, up 3.5 per cent to $165.14.“By definition, then, the Dow is going to look and act very differently. Leaving aside Nike replacing Hewlett-Packard, you’ve replaced two stocks that essentially don’t matter in Alcoa and Bank of America with two that do,” he said.The changes are the latest since UnitedHealth Group, the insurance company, replaced Kraft Foods in the index last year and the biggest change since 2004 when AIG, Pfizer and Verizon replaced Eastman Kodak, AT&T and International Paper.Mr Ablin said the changes could give the Dow a boost, but warned that, in the past, new entrants had marked a market peak, such as Microsoft joining in late 1999 just before the tech bubble burst a year later.“Nike is a consumer discretionary company and that sector has outperformed for the past five years. Had they made these changes five years ago the Dow would be a lot higher now.”The changes, the first “three for three” to the index since April 2004, will be effective with the opening of trading on Monday September 23.While professional investors generally use the S&P 500 as their performance benchmark, the Dow is widely referenced by the media and followed by main street investors, given its long history and status of reflecting the broad economy.S&P estimates that $2.14tn in funds follow the S&P 500, with just $37bn tracking the Dow.At the end of trading on Tuesday in New York, shares in Nike were up 2.2 per cent to $66.82 and Visa had added 3.4 per cent to $184.59. Alcoa was down 0.3 per cent to $8.06, HP had fallen 0.4 per cent to $22.27 and Bank of America was up 0.9 per cent to $14.61.
284;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-08-23T19:04:27Z;Get down to the knitty-gritty;Nike’s new Free Flyknits encourage you to run naturally: as if barefoot, but with a cushioned sole for support and protection;"At first it’s hard to decide which aspect of the new Nike Free Flyknits is most striking: the groundbreaking design or the fact that you’re expected to pay £130 for what is basically a sock with a sole.The latest in Nike’s lightweight Free line, which first appeared in 2004, Flyknits are designed to encourage you to run naturally: as if barefoot, but with a cushioned sole for support and protection. The key innovation of this version is the upper, which replaces the separate tongue, eyelets and overlays of conventional running shoes with one piece of knitted (I assume by a huge machine, rather than by a factory full of diligent needle-clackers), elasticated fabric for a second-skin-like fit.The designers seem to have both recreational runners and trainer collectors in mind as potential buyers, as the shoe most resembles one part Aladdin’s slippers – when off the foot the tightness of the knit curls the toe and heel up – and one part a jumper worn by Sarah Lund in The Killing. A colleague remarked that they looked like “something Hugh Hefner would wear if he took up running”. But, as interesting as the aesthetics are, for a runner the real test is how they would handle the worst that London’s streets could throw at them.Putting them on on a very humid day was the first challenge – it’s a bit like donning a particularly tight flight sock – but after a bit of wrestling I managed to squeeze in my bare feet. Limpet-like, the shoes felt noticeably tighter than my usual running shoes (I have seven pairs). In action, however, they proved very comfortable thanks to the fabric’s stretch and the fact they are free of potentially irritating interior seams. Cleverly, the fabric has different weaves for different parts of the foot; it’s thicker around the heel for example, while across the top of the foot there are perforations to let the skin breathe (which in my black versions created the tantalising look of a fishnet stocking).In my first trial run, a five-miler through the mean streets of suburban north London, I was struck by the lightness and flexibility of the Flyknit. The sole is so pliable I could bend it between steps just by pushing down my toes. After a while this, combined with the foot-mirroring shape and fit, made it easy to forget I was wearing shoes at all.When not training for a race, I usually run four or five times a week, typically five or six miles at a time, with a longer run at the weekend. During the week I tested them, the shoes proved to be equally adept in a quick three-mile road race and during a 10-mile cruise on a gravelled canal towpath.The Flyknit is admirably stealthy: it doesn’t feel like it’s impeding the way your foot connects with the ground, bar absorbing a bit of impact and stopping broken glass tearing your soles to shreds. My footsteps were quiet, a sign that I was treading lightly rather than crashing down on my heel with each foot strike.On the down side, the tight fit combined with the summer heat made my feet quite sweaty, and there was a spot of chafed skin on one heel after one run. Subsequently I solved the latter problem by wearing socks, but this ruined the stylistic effect somewhat. And while the long, thin grooves in the sole are essential for flexibility, they are also magnets for debris and small stones, which I ended up prying out of my shoes with a dinner knife.Ultimately, though, the shoe is more than a sock with a sole: It’s a triumph (albeit an expensive one) of pared-down design, retaining only the things you need for a smooth, efficient run, and jettisoning everything else. It was just a shame I had to betray it with socks.www.nike.comwww.runnersworld.co.uk"
285;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-08-23T16:59:52Z;A sporting chance of shedding celebrity endorsement problems;Misbehaving celebrities drive growth in specialist insurance;Less than four years after numerous sponsors broke ties with Tiger Woods following a string of sex scandals, the golfer signed an extension in July of an endorsement contract with Nike.The Woods controversy highlights the problem facing brands that rely on sports stars to heighten their profiles: many of sport’s most marketable names become embroiled in scandals, while the cost of endorsement contracts and worldwide marketing efforts is huge.To mitigate this risk, companies such as Nike are using specialised insurance plans and more stringent contracts in endorsement deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Companies normally have two choices when an endorsement goes wrong. Cut ties with the athlete, as they did with Lance Armstrong and baseball player Ryan Braun. Or ride out the storm in the hope that the scandal passes and the tarnished athlete returns to prominence, as happened with Mr Woods.Forgoing the sports star connection altogether is not an option. In modern marketing, endorsements are more important and more lucrative than ever before, says David Abrutyn, director of IMG Global Consulting“It’s a cliché, but the death of talent marketing has been widely exaggerated,” Mr Abrutyn says. “If you take a wide look at it and you see how celebrity and talent are able to break through in a world today that is as cluttered as it has ever been, I would venture to say more money has been spent this past year on talent marketing than the year before.”Despite the high-profile media attention, a string of scandals have not persuaded the world’s largest companies to move away from signing major endorsement deals with notable athletes.But not all brands will stand by a disgraced athlete, and need a tidy way to terminate contracts and recoup losses.Numerous major sponsors including General Motors, AT&T and Gatorade ended their deals with Mr Woods after a series of infidelities came to light. Researchers from the University of California at Davis said the scandal cost shareholders of the sponsors between $5bn and $12bn.The recent suspension of a group of baseball players for violating the league’s performance-enhancing drug restrictions has already resulted in one high-profile separation – between Nike and Mr Braun.Mr Braun is not alone. A number of the world’s most high-profile athletes have been embroiled in recent years in serious controversies and dropped by sponsors, including basketball player Kobe Bryant, American football player Michael Vick and paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius.As a result, companies have begun to insert clauses to allow for the sponsor to cancel the agreement if an athlete acts in a way that could be considered damaging to the brand.“What has happened over the past few years is that contracts have gotten pretty tight,” says Joe Addison, chief executive of Aon Risk Solutions’ Global Entertainment Group. “It has evolved because of what has happened.”You could pay tens of millions of dollars to partner with these athletes. If you have to abandon that campaign, it’s potentially a big loss on your booksBut some major stars have the clout to negotiate morality clauses out of their contracts, leaving companies to pursue insurance coverage, Mr Addison added.These policies have become more popular, says Shaun Crosner, who heads the sports insurance practice at law firm Dickstein Shapiro, as they allow companies to sign up the most popular players while addressing concerns about possible losses.“This was not viewed as a coverage that was an important piece of the risk management portfolio. Now it is,” says Mr Crosner. “There’s so much money going into these ad campaigns. You could pay tens of millions of dollars to partner with these athletes. If you have to abandon that campaign, it’s potentially a big loss on your books.”Athlete endorsements are a competitive market. Brands across the globe are chasing a finite amount of talent. Nike spent $909m on endorsement contracts in its most recent fiscal year, according to the company’s annual report.Some of that money goes to team, league, and college sponsorships, but much of it goes to individuals, such as golfer Rory McIlroy, whose multiyear deal is reportedly worth at least $100m. NBA star Derek Rose signed a long-term deal with Adidas that has been reported to be worth $250m.Those players are more accessible than ever through social media and extensive sports entertainment coverage. This has caused sportswear companies to take more time to vet sports stars and avoid ones that might not fit the brand.“Organisations are being more and more careful because there were a couple of years where they were throwing money at players,” says Antonio Williams, assistant professor of sports marketing at Indiana University. “What you want as a sponsor is an athlete that can reinforce your brand or reinvent your brand.“This player personifies the image of my company. When that doesn’t match, you have to get rid of it.”
286;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
287;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-08-13T22:26:28Z;FitBit raises $43m to stay ahead of the pack;Fitness tracking device pioneer lifts capital base to $96m;FitBit, the maker of health and fitness tracking devices, has raised $43m in venture capital funding, as large competitors like Apple and Samsung prepare to enter the “wearable technologies” field.The latest financing round involving SoftBank Capital, SAP Ventures, and Qualcomm Ventures was revealed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday and brings FitBit’s total financing to $96m.The company said it will use the money to build its team. Since launching in 2008, FitBit has seen a wave of other companies launch their own gadgets, from large companies such as Nike to start-up companies like Misfit Wearables.In recent months, smartphone rivals Apple, Samsung, and Google have all been rumoured to be working on “smart watches”, which could incorporate the kind of fitness tracking capabilities pioneered by start-ups such as FitBit.Manufacturers are expected to ship almost 44m fitness monitors this year, with that number forecasted to grow to 56m annually by 2017, according to IHS research firm.“Fitness monitoring is big business, spanning the glamorous world of famous sports figures, to the burgeoning fitness industry, to the realms of clinical and military research,” said Shane Walker, senior manager for consumer & digital health research at IHS.Customers carry FitBit’s pedometer, the size of a couple pieces of chewing gum, or wear its new wristband to track daily activity, sending a feed to the person’s smartphone of steps taken, calories expended, weight and other metrics.Employers and insurance companies are increasingly interested in the potential benefit such data can have on improving health and lowering healthcare costs. Several companies have made bulk purchases of the original FitBit pedometer to distribute to employees as part of their corporate health and wellness programmes.The funding comes on the heels of investments in two health tracking software start-ups. MyFitnessPal, a calorie and fitness tracking mobile app, raised $18m from Kleiner Perkins and Accel Partners. Glow, a new fertility tracking app from Max Levchin, launched last week with $6m in funding from Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz.
288;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-07-26T17:13:04Z;UK Olympic heroes fail to strike gold after summer of medals;Bar a few top athletes, triumph has failed to bring financial riches;If the stars of Britain’s Olympic summer of triumph last year were hoping their medal-winning success would reap riches, they have been left sorely disappointed – with a few notable exceptions.The return of athletes such as Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis to the Olympic Stadium this weekend for the Anniversary Games is set to be a glorious recollection of the summer of 2012.But for many of them, it is also a stark reminder that they must return to the reality of financial sacrifice in the race to stay competitive.A year ago, it seemed possible to dream otherwise. The Olympic build-up furnished most of the 500-plus members of Team GB with National Lottery funding and lucrative corporate sponsorship.Brands saw honesty and dignity in the athletes’ clean-cut image, a million miles away from the less-than-endearing values of the nation’s millionaire footballers. As they climbed the medallists’ podium, sponsors and the public rose to acclaim new sporting heroes.But according to Fast Track, a sports agency that matched hundreds of athletes to willing sponsors, only a handful of those deals remain.“Of those who became household names, the vast majority have now slipped back into their minority sports,” said Jon Wyatt of Fast Track. “It’s all about being only as good as your most recent success and what happens next. Brands are clearly looking at the next rising star.”The flow of British sporting success – in the form of the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, US Open winner Justin Rose, the British Lions and England’s Ashes squad – shows how quickly the Olympians’ achievements faded, and also the intensity of the competition in the sports sponsorship market.Team GB’s success in bringing home 65 medals – 29 of them gold – also proved to be a poisoned chalice.Jamie Cunningham, who represents boxer Nicola Adams, diver Tom Daley and the Brownlee brothers of triathlon endeavour, says that in other eras, Olympic athletes would have made money from winning gold. “But in simple terms, Britain was too successful,” said Mr Cunningham. “There are too many good rowers, which has meant no standout superstars.”Fees for appearances are falling. “There are more Olympians available for fewer jobs,” he added. “They may have been hoping for £8,000-£10,000, but they are now getting £3,000-£4,000.”Some of those who prospered benefited from early identification as the “ones to watch”. The marketing of Paralympian swimmer Ellie Simmonds has been in full flow since the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Cyclist Victoria Pendleton, now retired, had nine sponsorship deals going into the 2012 games, earning her £1m last year. But Chris Evans-Pollard, her agent, said even though most of those deals ended at the start of 2013, she could still earn a similar amount this year.“There are different projects she’s involved in and PR activity she will do with certain brands,” said Mr Evans-Pollard.Other athletes appeared out of nowhere and are making good money. Adams is in demand and in a position to turn down appearance requests, said Mr Cunningham. And Farah is the biggest draw, reputedly paid £450,000 for running half the London marathon.“Mo’s gone from nothing to an incredibly high profile,” said Mr Evans-Pollard. “He is one of the top names that any brand would like to have.”Contrast Farah with long-jumper Greg Rutherford, one of the trio of gold medallists on that “Super Saturday” Olympics high point. He was dropped by Nike and has fallen back on launching a clothing range.“It’s still about sports personalities having to sell products. If they don’t make a difference, they don’t work,” said Mr Cunningham.Nor does it work unless the endorsement income is sufficiently high. Freddie Huxtable, sports tax consultant with RSM Tenon, said a sponsorship deal of £50,000 over three years is soon diluted by tax, training costs and agents’ fees.“For large numbers, a job alongside their training regime is the only practical answer,” he said.The Olympians are at least back on the track. It is their competitive absence since London 2012 that highlights why they will always lose out to football stars in the long run.“The Premier League has almost become a 365-days-a-year phenomenon,” said Nigel Currie of the marketing consultants BrandRapport. “It can maintain a consistent flow of exposure and opportunities. A lot of sports can’t.”

There are the price comparison pros, who search for bargains armed with apps such as RedLaser and Amazon Barcode Scanner; the window shoppers, who “pin”, “like” and share covetable items on Pinterest and Polyvore moodboards; and the wishlisters, who favour sites with “Save for Later” options to create a fantasy wardrobe from which they may buy just one or two items.Away from shopping sites, however, the see-it-want-it shopper – who sees something online and wants to buy it there and then – has not really been catered for. Helsinki-based Kiosked aims to change this.Kiosked turns digital content – whether an advertising image, music video or written text – into a point of sale. “Kiosked is not an ad network, it doesn’t push and isn’t intrusive; it just gives you the opportunity to buy when you see something,” says chief executive Micke Paqvalén.When an image or video is “Kiosked” a small icon appears indicating it is “enriched”. Shoppers click on the icon, and products related to the image or video pop up, offering the option to “buy now”. They are then taken directly to the retail site. For example, a trailer for Finnish pop star Robin’s tour movie, posted on his Facebook page, allows viewers to purchase T-shirts and DVDs. Shoppers are never shown out-of-stock products as Kiosked updates in real time.“Shoppable videos are the future,” says John Jannuzzi, contributing digital editor of US shopping publication LuckyMag.com.Etailers such as Barneys Co-op are already producing shoppable videos. The challenge for brands is to make these videos more engaging.Kiosked has been working with Nike on its product launches, sending out “Kiosked” images and videos to publishers who can embed them in their own sites. It has also struck a deal with other retailers including Uniqlo, Asos and Yoox. Paqvalén is busy with plans for a global checkout system so that in the future anyone will be able to buy anything, anytime, anywhere.Johanna Virtanen, Kios­ked’s head of new business development, says: “Instead of dragging people to products, we take products to the people.”Fiona Harkin is senior vice-president of content at Stylus.com"
290;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-07-17T18:46:36Z;Tech revolution to inch into what we wear;Three categories of device will become prevalent, says Intel chief;The revolution will be wearable. Only, like most technology revolutions, it will not come as fast or in quite the form that the visionaries predict.That is the safe bet for what is quickly becoming Silicon Valley’s most hyped new claim: that “smart” devices like watches and glasses represent that next front in personal computing.The plunging costs of hardware and the spread of wireless networks certainly point to a time when digital intelligence and connectivity will creep into many different personal items – not to mention the broader world of inanimate objects, creating a much-predicted “internet of things”. More difficult to anticipate is exactly how this revolution will first be felt, though there are clues.Three different categories of device – for the ears, eyes and wrists, and each with its own set of uses – will soon become prevalent, predicts new Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. What the killer apps of these will be, however, is still anyone’s guess.So far, you can probably put the fact that wearables remain more a subject of discussion than practical experimentation down to teething troubles. As reported in the FT earlier this week, Apple’s hotly anticipated iWatch probably won’t appear until late next year at the earliest. With other personal tech companies racing to come up with something similar, other smart watches look certain to appear sooner – though until Apple passes its aesthetic judgment, the personal tech world will continue to hold its breath.Meanwhile, that other standard-bearer of the wearables revolution, Google’s Glass, has been facing some headwinds of its own. US congressional leaders voiced their concerns recently about the privacy-infringing implications of a face-mounted device capable of constantly monitoring and recording everything in front of the wearer. And earlier this week came news that a software flaw, now corrected, would have allowed malicious hackers to take control of devices.Technological capabilities are not the main limiting factor here. The crucial question, as always, is whether the benefits of using a new technology exceed the resistance to adopting it – from getting comfortable with the new interfaces and hardware to developing the cultural and social norms the technology demands.There are two very different visions for how wearable computing will break into the mainstream.One holds that it will seep into everyday life, through gadgets that perform a single function but remain largely invisible. Wristbands made by Nike and Jawbone are the forerunners of these smart devices, measuring and reporting back to apps to track and analyse aspects of the wearers’ fitness and health.The other vision involves a full-frontal assault on general-purpose personal computing. In this version of events, a watch or pair of glasses will subsume many of the killer apps of the smartphone, starting with things like making phone calls, checking text messages or taking pictures, before eventually making today’s favourite gadgets redundant. By opening these devices up as platforms for third party developers, their makers hope to increase the odds that they’ll come up with things to make the gadgets indispensable.Of the two, the history of personal technology points to the former as the more likely. General-purpose computing platforms, from the PC to the internet, take years to tame. For anything that has to be integrated into personal life so completely, the key watchword will be seamlessness. Things that make life simpler are likely to lead the way – especially if their hardware remains invisible and their functions automatic.Ironically, one of the first killer apps for such gadgets is likely to involve civilising the smartphone itself. Today’s handsets have imposed a tyranny on personal life, crashing into conversations and turning city pavements into parades of the distracted. The first smartwatches seek to mediate this smartphone-dominated world, for instance by signalling text alerts in a less intrusive way.Wearable computing’s truly revolutionary moment is only likely to come after enough of these seamless gadgets have found their way into the world, creating a constellation that itself becomes a new computing platform.Smartphones were marginal for years until Steve Jobs bullied, cajoled and inspired his colleagues at Apple to create the iPhone.

293;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Nike to tackle rising Asian labour costs;;Nike is to tackle rising labour costs at its Asian factories by “engineering the labour out” of its shoe and clothing production as it seeks to defend its profits.Don Blair, Nike’s chief financial officer, said its objective was to reduce the number of people making its products as he highlighted the impact of a sharp increase in wages in Indonesia.The US sports group and other multinational manufacturers are also battling a sustained rise in Chinese labour costs.Mr Blair said: “I think the longer-term solution to addressing a lot of these labour costs has really been engineering the labour out of the product and that really is with technology and innovation.”He cited Nike’s Flyknit running shoe, whose upper part is a machine-knitted yarn. Nike is also using 3D printing technology to make prototype soles for professional athletes.Cutting factory workers could also reduce Nike’s exposure to criticism over labour practices at its contractors, which has dogged it sporadically since the first big anti-sweatshop campaigns of the 1990s.In January this year activists criticised Nike’s suppliers in Indonesia for seeking exemptions to the minimum wage, which are allowed for companies that cannot afford to raise pay. Nike launched an investigation and determined that contract factories were within their rights to seek such exemptions.The reset requires discipline and patience. The race in China is a marathon, not a sprintBut when Nike reported its quarterly results on Thursday it said higher wage costs had eaten into its profits. Even so its profitability was still higher than a year ago thanks to product price rises, lower raw material costs and a lower tax rate.Shoe and garment making remains more labour-intensive than most other manufacturing, which explains why 98-99 per cent of items worn by Americans are made in emerging markets with relatively low wage costs.The three biggest source countries for Nike products are Vietnam, China and Indonesia.Nike’s net profit for the three months to May 31 was up 22 per cent to $668m, or 76 cents per share, narrowly beating expectations. Total sales rose 7 per cent to $6.7bn, beating forecasts by around $100m.The company continues to rely heavily on its sponsorship deals with sports stars to generate demand for its products.This week it received a burst of extra publicity from the Wimbledon tennis tournament when Roger Federer was ordered to stop wearing orange-soled Nike shoes that breached the tournament’s dress code.Nike’s sales in the past quarter rose in the US and some emerging markets, but were flat in China and fell in Japan and western Europe.In China, the company is managing its way through a glut of inventory, bad product choices and slowing economic growth, and said it needed more time to fix its problems.Mark Parker, Nike chief executive, said: “The reset requires discipline and patience. The race in China is a marathon, not a sprint.”Nike shook up its executive team last week, announcing moves that included the retirement of its second most senior executive, Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand.Nike shares initially rose in after-market trading on its results, but then fell 2.1 per cent when company executives made gloomy remarks about the Chinese market.
294;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-06-25T19:56:59Z;US businesses give mixed reaction to Obama’s emission cuts plan;;Several large US companies spoke out on Tuesday in support of President Barack Obama’s plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, although other companies and business lobby groups signalled their intention to fight his proposed new regulations.Businesses including Mars, the privately held confectionery group, and Swiss Re, the reinsurance company, issued statements urging action to tackle the threat of man-made global warming.The companies are signatories of a recent declaration that the US should be “taking the lead” in addressing climate change, which is also backed by businesses including General Motors, Starbucks, Nike, Intel and Unilever.Mark Way, Swiss Re’s head of sustainability for the Americas, said: “We applaud this announcement by the president . . . We view the threat posed by climate change as a very real one. As a society we need to act now and not stick our heads in the sand.”The Geneva Association, the global insurance trade body, warned on Monday that some coastal areas of the US and UK were becoming “uninsurable” because of the rising risks created by global warming.Mars said climate change would affect its business because of its impact on agriculture, and said: “It is imperative we continue to improve sustainability in our approach to business, as well as the way we create policy.”However, some business lobby groups attacked Mr Obama’s proposals, warning they would cause severe damage to the economy.Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the plans risked “punishing Americans with higher energy bills, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy” for negligible environmental benefits.He added: “American consumers, workers, and businesses simply cannot afford another smothering layer of new regulations whose benefits are unproven and whose true costs are hidden.”The US coal industry, which would be the principal loser from Mr Obama’s attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, was particularly vocal.Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which represents the coal-fired power industry, said: “This is going to be a legacy issue for the president: a legacy of higher energy costs, lost jobs and a shattered economy.”He added: “If the Obama administration fails to recognise the environmental progress the industry has made and continues to adopt more regulations, coal power could cease to exist which would be devastating for our economy.”The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problemThe shares of US coal mining companies have been falling sharply since details of Mr Obama’s plans began to emerge over the weekend.Alpha Natural Resources’ shares have lost 9 per cent of their value since Friday night, while Peabody Energy’s are down 10 per cent.Although the details of the plans for existing plants have not been worked out – Mr Obama is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to come up with proposed rules in a year’s time and then final regulations a year after that – analysts expect their impact is likely to be to shift power generation away from coal and towards natural gas.Burning gas for power generates roughly half the greenhouse gas emissions of burning coal.The gas industry welcomed the president’s statement.Dave McCurdy, president of the American Gas Association, which represents gas utilities, said: “We envision a future where natural gas not only provides energy for homes and businesses, but runs a significant number of our vehicles, generates power and supports other forms of renewable energy.”Kevin Kennedy of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank, said opponents of new regulation typically tended to overestimate its costs when debating whether it should be introduced.“Once regulations are actually in place, industries often find that their estimates have been overstated, and they are able to comply at a reasonable cost,” he said.

That’s according to Maria Sharapova, the 26-year-old who’s currently ranked number three in the world. Sharapova, who also designs for Nike and is regularly seen front row at fashion shows, is taking time out from her pre-Wimbledon training to discuss her off-the-court style.“I love to get dressed up when I have the opportunity, though on an everyday level the most exciting thing that happens to me is going out to dinner with my coach and my physio. It’s not like I’m going to pull out show-stopping outfits just for them.“Still, I travel to some of the best cities in the world, so it would be a shame if I didn’t get to visit some stores. I have a whole list of notes in my phone of where to go – and a pretty good map in my head of my favourite stores in Paris, such as Isabel Marant, Surface to Air, Vanessa Bruno and Colette; the concept stores are really interesting.“My earliest memories of moving [from Russia] to Florida, age nine, are of my mum going to the stores to buy something for herself. The big shopping malls were so new to me because we didn’t have anything like that back in my home town of Sochi. I was amazed by the selection, the colours. My mum would always buy classic pieces in neutral shades. That’s when I started to understand about quality, about buying something timeless you’ll have for ever. Obviously, I didn’t have any budget to buy any of it then but I just remember being so excited having a chance to look through some nice stuff. And I did like pink – it was my favourite colour for a really long time . . . though I’m sworn to neutrals now.“My life really revolves around travelling, I live out of a suitcase, so everything that I pack has to work together. I layer a lot. I love the masculine looks of Stella McCartney tailoring. Like my mum, I’ve always thought it’s important to spend just a little bit more on tailoring because then you are always comfortable – you’re not worried about how it fits.”And at 6ft 2in, is finding things that fit a problem? “I wouldn’t say it’s a challenge. There are so many things out there right now. And I’m also not a size zero. The higher the sizes, the ‘taller’ the things are. Though mostly I wear flats . . . ”Given the career sidelines of peers such as Venus and Serena Williams, has she considered her own fashion line? “I thought about it but I wanted to do something unexpected.” Cue Sugarpova: high-end gummy chews and gumballs (£3.99) that sell though Selfridges in London and Colette in Paris.“As I’m an athlete, I think it took many people by surprise,” she says. “I’ve had a sweet tooth since I was very young and the whole idea was doing something that was unique.” Still, there are plans to move “into cosmetics and beauty products, maybe clothing.”For now, though, it’s all about the candy. The best sellers so far? The tennis ball-shaped gumballs, of course.——————————————-store.nike.comwww.isabelmarant.comwww.surfacetoair.comwww.vanessabruno.comwww.colette.frwww.stellamccartney.comwww.brownsfashion.comwww.selfridges.comwww.sugarpova.com"
296;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-06-17T15:56:04Z;Li-Ning lost out to foreign rivals in China;The sportswear company fell behind Nike and Adidas because it failed to innovate sufficiently;"The storyGymnast Li Ning became a Chinese hero in 1984 when he won six medals at the Los Angeles Olympics, the country’s first appearance at a summer games in 32 years.By 1990 he had set up his own sportswear company, Li-Ning. It was an immediate hit, and in 1999 the company’s revenues in China reached Rmb700m, more than twice Nike’s Rmb300m and Adidas’s Rmb100m.The challengeThe growing spending power of China’s middle-class consumers and their appetite for foreign brands, combined with the surging popularity of basketball and football – with which Nike and Adidas were associated – helped the two overseas companies win more sales in China than Li-Ning.The strategyInitially, there was little overlap in the market segments targeted by Li-Ning and its foreign rivals. The Chinese company offered mass-market leisurewear and Nike and Adidas sold professional-standard athletic wear; Li-Ning was market leader in China’s second and third-tier cities, while Nike and Adidas were in Beijing and Shanghai.But after 2001, when China won the bid to host the 2008 Olympics, interest in sports reached new heights. Li-Ning tried to emulate its foreign rivals’ marketing tactics.● Brand ambassadors: The overseas companies used celebrity athletes such as American basketball players Michael Jordan (Nike) and Kobe Bryant (Adidas). Nike also signed three of China’s globally successful sports stars: hurdler Liu Xiang, tennis champion Li Na and NBA star Yao Ming.Because Mr Li was his brand’s biggest ambassador, consumers began associating Li-Ning only with gymnastics goods.● Sponsorship: Nike-sponsored activities focused on basketball, while Adidas did the same with football. Li-Ning sponsored sports where China traditionally dominated, such as diving and gymnastics, but these did not have the same youth appeal.After its 2004 initial public offering, Li-Ning bought the rights to use the NBA logo and players in its marketing and advertising in China. But it could only afford to sponsor lower profile teams and events.Mr Li lit the cauldron that signalled the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but Adidas won sponsorship of those games, which gave it the right to clothe the Chinese teams.● Logos and slogans: The “L” logo of Li-Ning bore a marked resemblance to Nike’s swoosh, while its “Anything is Possible” slogan was not so different from Nike’s “Just do it”.In 2010, hoping to appeal to the “post-1990s-born” generation, Li-Ning launched a fresh campaign. But the new logo and slogan, “Make the Change”, did not excite the target audience and alienated its original, now older, customer base.● Pricing: Li-Ning raised its prices in 2010 but premium-segment consumers found the quality of Nike and Adidas was still better, while lower and mid-price-segment consumers chose cheaper, local brands.What happenedLi-Ning grew from 3,373 outlets at the end of 2005 to 6,245 outlets three years later, including new stores in cities with Olympic venues. Although revenues jumped 54 per cent in 2008, moving Li-Ning ahead of Adidas, the latter had overtaken again by 2010.Inflation and slower economic growth began to affect consumer sentiment and in 2011 growth in sportswear overall fell to 13 per cent from 20 per cent in 2010. Sales revenues in 2011 for Nike, Adidas and Li-Ning respectively were about $2bn, $1.7bn and $1.4bn. In the first half of 2012, Nike and Adidas had rising sales, whereas Li-Ning experienced declines .The lessonsLi NIng failed to adapt as the market developed, and the positioning confused consumers. Its logo and slogans were too similar to competitors’, which led consumers to think it was an imitator.Brands must know their audience and innovate constantly to match consumers’ changing tastes. A brand that raises prices must make a corresponding increase in quality.The writers are, respectively, dean and vice-president, a former research assistant, and a visiting researcher at Ceibs"
297;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-06-11T22:51:35Z;Campaigns: NGOs get handy with stick and carrot;Activist critics have turned to collaboration to shape business best practice, writes Sarah Murray;In February this year, Oxfam released a briefing paper titled “Behind the Brands” assessing the social and environmental impacts of the world’s 10 largest food and beverage companies. The report acknowledged where progress was being made and also accused companies of failing to “ensure the wellbeing of those working to produce their products”.The Oxfam paper reflects a new era in the relationship between companies and campaigners – one in which activism and collaboration combine.“It’s not just naming and shaming – it’s a combination of praising and shaming,” says Frances Buckingham, manager in the London office of SustainAbility, a think tank and consultancy.The approach might be described as the third stage in what has been a gradual evolution of the relationship between companies and campaign groups.The relationship between companies and campaigners was once largely combative, with boycotts and protests being the main weapon in the activists’ armoury.Brands such as Gap, Nike and Reebok were often at the receiving end of anti-sweatshop campaigns, for example, while the extractive industries have been attacked for practices such as using military force to defend their operations.In recent years, many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and environmental campaigners have recognised that activism can only go so far. Many felt that collaborating with companies to help them lower their carbon footprint or create better conditions for their workers could be a powerful way to bring about change – particularly in the case of the multinational organisations that have vast global footprints and extensive supply chains.Most big-brand NGOs now have business-facing units set up with the express purpose of helping companies adapt their processes and strategies to take account of environmental and social needs.“There was a honeymoon period where NGOs who may have been solely focused on advocacy became excited about the potential to engage companies in new ways,” says Sean Ansett, managing partner at Stake Advisors, a corporate social responsibility consultancy.However, any company predicting the demise of corporate activism would be mistaken. The continued willingness of organisations such as Oxfam and Greenpeace to hold companies to account is evidence that activism and advocacy are alive and well.“There’s a realisation that no one is moving fast enough and there’s a need to push companies in the right direction,” says Ms Buckingham.New civic organisations are gaining ground. These include six-year-old Avaaz, which organises campaigns on everything from corruption and poverty to climate change. Technology is also providing an alternative form of activism by arming consumers with social media tools.“Activism has moved a online,” says Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra, a sustainability communications company. “It’s death by a thousand tweets.” Social media makes it quick and cheap to organise and easy for the public to join in. “It used to take months to organise a campaign,” says Mr Ansett. “Now it’s much easier for people to participate and respond.”Campaigns against companies can cause reputational damage that lasts long after the publicity has died down. “People remember the campaign and not what you did about it,” says Ms Townsend.“Companies like Nike and Nestlé have in many cases done exceptional work on cleaning up,” she says. “But still the most memorable part of their brand for a lot of people are the campaigns against them.”Meanwhile, as Oxfam’s “Behind the Brands” initiative highlights, established NGOs are developing sophisticated strategies that allow them to both collaborate and engage with companies.“I want us to be challenging, investigating and exposing bad practices when we can – but also collaborating and supporting companies that are trying to lead the field and promote good practice,” says Mark Goldring, Oxfam’s new chief executive. “We do a bit of each, and that’s the way of our future.”So, whether delivered by social media or as part of an NGO strategy, it seems unlikely that activism will disappear.While attitudes to companies have moved beyond simply viewing the corporate sector as an evil empire, events that hit the headlines remind us that companies can have a large positive or negative influence on the health of the planet and the working conditions of people in developing countries.The BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 provided a dramatic illustration of this, while the recent death of more than 1,200 Bangladeshi garment workers beneath a collapsed factory complex has renewed public attention on ethical sourcing.Even NGOs that want to work with companies to help them make more progress on social and environmental recognise the stick is just as powerful as the carrot.“Activism is alive and well,” says Ms Townsend. “But now it just looks different.”
298;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-06-09T17:35:45Z;New stamping ground for Nike and Adidas as 3D shoes kick off;;Nike and Adidas are embracing 3D printing to speed up the shoemaking process, using the technology to make multiple prototype versions at a previously impossible speed.While 3D printing has generated hype over potential home use – including gun making– it is becoming an important complement to the multinationals’ labour-intensive Asian factories.3D printers lay down particles of plastic, metal or even wood in thin layers that build up into solid objects. The footwear makers are using them to print and modify prototype plastic soles with studs, or cleats, for football and running shoes.Shane Kohatsu, innovation director at Nike’s Oregon headquarters, told the Financial Times that 3D printing had accelerated development of its Vapor Laser Talon boot for professional American footballers.“Within six months we were able to go through 12 rounds of prototype iterations that we fully tested, and ultimately we were able to make super dramatic improvements to our products,” he said.The sole is made of solid nylon. With traditional injection moulding techniques, whereby molten plastic is injected into a steel mould, Nike would typically update complex product parts such as studs “every couple of years”, Mr Kohatsu said.Germany’s Adidas said 3D printers had reduced the time it needed to evaluate a new prototype by four to six weeks to one or two days.Before the advent of 3D printing, Adidas prototypes were handmade by 12 technicians. With the new technology, no more than two people are required to produce them.In sports footwear, innovations typically come on the bottom of the shoe – as with the air-cushioned Nike Air range introduced in the 1980s, and the bouncy foam-based Boost running shoe that Adidas launched this year.With 3D printing – also called additive manufacturing – shoe makers are exploiting technological advances that were driven by heavy industries such as aerospace.3D printing is already being used to make personalised hearing aids and hip replacements. It could conceivably be used for individually tailored shoes.The shoe companies have not put a price tag on 3D-printed shoes as none are yet being sold to consumers.The three biggest makers of 3D printers are EOS of Germany, the US’s 3D Systems, and a US-Israeli company Stratasys, which has a client roster that includes Reebok, New Balance and Under Armour as well as Nike and Adidas.Bruce Bradshaw, director of marketing at Stratasys, said mass shoe production via 3D printing itself was some way off, but added: “Will they get there? Absolutely.”The main limitation at present is the slow speed of printing: it would take a Stratasys machine about two hours to produce a single sole.“What’s really intriguing for us is not the volumes that you can make. It’s really more how rapidly you can make changes,” said Nike’s Mr Kohatsu.
299;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-05-24T22:44:45Z;Golf: global game defies downturn;Bolstered by interest from the east, the game is in rude health although it would do well to address its elitist image;"The talking points in golf are numerous, controversial and complex. Should Tiger Woods have disqualified himself from the US Masters for hitting an illegal shot? Should a 14-year-old Chinese golfer have been penalised in the same tournament for slow play? Did Masters winner Adam Scott gain an unfair advantage by using a long putter? Has Rory McIlroy’s game been affected by his new multimillion-dollar Nike deal?Lucky golf. Lucky to have problems that other sports would love to have rather than their own more serious ones: like cycling, still coming to terms with the Lance Armstrong doping scandal; or football, whose main governing body Fifa is regarded with so much distrust; or sports such as cricket and, again, football, where the whiff of match-fixing lingers.True, the latest controversy – the racism row and feud involving Woods and Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia compounded by further comments from George O’Grady, chief executive of the European Tour – hardly makes for pleasant reading. But other sports would quickly recognise that the social shortcomings of individuals are common to all of them.Golf’s cognoscenti would in any case challenge any suggestion that luck has anything to do with it. Integrity, sportsmanship and dignity are the creeds associated with golf that have attracted television audiences and sponsors down the decades and continue to do so. These are hard-earned, hard-fought values.If anything, the Garcia-Woods feud is the most threatening of golf’s recent controversies because it undermines the foundation stones of these values.Nonetheless, fortune has played some role in golf’s relatively untroubled progress of recent years. Golf has been fortunate that the global downturn, which caused problems in the sport’s heartlands of the US and the UK, has not been nearly so severe in Asia, where the game’s most vibrant growth markets sit.Golf has cause to be grateful that Woods, one of the best-known sportsmen on the planet, has rediscovered his game after some barren years. Furthermore, his battle for supremacy with the young charismatic McIlroy, though artificial and hyped in many respects, at least offers a reasonably compelling story.Then there was the extreme good fortune of last year’s Ryder Cup being one of the most gripping sporting encounters of recent years.No less fortuitous is the restoration of golf to the Olympics in 2016, a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and perhaps add a fresh format, but most of all to instil new energy into the game. One can spend many hours in the bars of club houses arguing whether golf has struck lucky getting into the Olympics, or has earned it. Either way, it is a chance that must not be squandered.Golf’s senior administrators are seasoned enough not to get sucked into complacency. The European Tour, which must surely consider changing its name now that its tournament schedule is so global, can take some of the credit for keeping the game motoring in upcoming markets, particularly Asia.“The academies in China and South Korea are huge,” George O’Grady, European Tour chief executive, says.South America, China and southeast Asia – all doing relatively well economically in comparison with the mature US and UK markets – will see plenty of growth in demand for golf as the appetite of their growing middle classes is whetted.“It is an optimistic period. There are opportunities in all parts of the world, but we have got to get off our backsides and find them. Every golf tournament has to have atmosphere,” says O’Grady.The recession in golf’s mature markets has concentrated minds on how to keep the game moving. Andrea Sartori of KPMG’s golf advisory practice, says supply and demand in the traditional markets of the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland had in recent years suffered from “a certain degree of stagnation”.There is nothing surprising in golf participation moving with the economic forces at work in its main markets.The difference this time is the depth of the recession, says Glen Nager, president of the US Golf Association. “That makes the challenges for the industry in the present time greater than in earlier times.“Society has changed too. Time is a much more precious commodity to people. We live by the minute rather than the day.”Is this a historic moment in the game of golf? “I believe so, yes,” he says. On the one hand, the professional game looks as strong as ever, the players are enriched by the European and PGA tours and television companies and sponsors are sustaining interest.New deals propelled golf from the sixth biggest sport in terms of sponsorship value in 2011 to the second in 2012, behind football, according to World Sponsorship Monitor.Golf Channel, NBC’s television station, is on course for its third successive annual increase in viewing numbers. The average CBS rating, meanwhile, for the final round of this year’s Masters was up 26 per cent on the same round last year.On the other hand, says Mr Nager, “the rest of the game has suffered”.The USGA believes that there are three significant challenges to the game in the US and the UK: how to reduce the cost of the sport; how to increase the speed of play; and how to reach new populations. In other words, golf needs to address the elitist image that puts off large numbers of people.Competitive prices have helped to stimulate golf tourism. Golfing holidays were up 9.3 per cent last year compared with 2011, as operators largely kept their prices static. Sales exceed €1.5bn annually. Despite their economic problems, Spain and Portugal continue to lead the way as the most popular destinations.“Tour operators are quite optimistic about the future,” says Sartori. “Maybe they are getting used to a little less profitability.”If golf can tackle these barriers that prevent many more from playing, then the game has indeed a bright outlook. But Nager remains cautious.“Too early to say,” he responds, when asked if the US market was now restored to growth. His point is that it does not take much to veer the golfing economy off course again.“We need to keep redoubling our efforts. We need to make sure that if the bad times come, we won’t be worse off than we might have been. And if the good times come, we will be exponentially better off.”"
300;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-05-20T22:59:38Z;Ups and downs of global brands: Consumers luxuriate in shopping on the web;Prada leads the catwalk pack, says Louise Lucas;Girls – and presumably boys too – just wanna have fun.The companies whose brand values have risen the most in the 2013 BrandZ rankings are all about the fun things in life: designer outfits, cheap and cheerful fashion, beer, shops and movies. All washed down, of course, with lashings of Brazilian beer.Leading the catwalk is Prada, the Italian luxury designer that listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in June 2011 under the ticker 1913 – the year it was founded – to join L’Occitane and Samsonite in tapping Asian investor demand for well-known western consumer brands with a convincing China growth strategy.Milan-based Prada raised $2.14bn when it became the first luxury brand to list in Hong Kong. Fast forward nearly two years and its brand value has pirouetted 63 per cent in the past year to $9.4bn, just ahead of the 61 per cent leap posted by Brazilian beer Brahma.Peter Walshe, global director of BrandZ, dubs Prada “exclusivity that travels”: strong brand management that it has successfully transported to the likes of China and Latin America.Far from diluting the brand with lower price offerings, such as perfumes, it has opened entry points along the chain “allowing different people access without having to dilute the brand too much”.The same applies to Gucci, Prada’s luxury fashion house stable mate, which saw its brand rise 48 per cent to $12.7bn.Gucci also holds the title of highest brand contribution in the category – as opposed to the financial component of the brand valuation. Alongside Burberry, it has the category’s highest growing brand contribution.“Gucci is exceptionally good at retaining the classic look but adding the modern touch, which is what Coca-Cola does so well,” says Robin Headlee, vice-president for Europe at Millward Brown. “They are keeping it modern but keeping the craftsmanship and doing a lot digitally: 13 per cent of online sales come from its mobile platform.”Digital sales are blossoming in importance, for all the fancy sleek glass stores that dot the most chic streets of Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris. The trick, says Mr Walshe, is to recreate the luxury experience of super-smart stores online – and not just on bigger screens, but also on mobiles as a lot of sales are generated via phone handsets.Steve Wilkinson, head of consumer products at Ernst & Young in the UK, says social media has created a win-win for the luxury and apparel sectors.“Brand owners, on the one hand, are able to get more feedback from consumers more quickly, while the most loyal consumers are able to get more engaged with the apparel and luxury lifestyle, on the other,” he says.“This interaction may be nothing new, but social media have made this interaction much more frequent, and ultimately richer.”Perhaps no one platform sums up that interaction so well as eBay, where shoppers and sellers come together and buying entails more than a single click – and can, indeed, include anxious moments crouched over the computer or phone to see if you have won your quarry.Ebay’s brand value rose 40 per cent over the year, ranking it the 11th biggest riser with a brand value of $17.7bn. This put it on a par with Disney, valued at $23.9bn.In between luxury experiences and bidding came the high street fashion stores. The number three big riser, Zara, was up 60 per cent at $20.2bn. As a result, the Spanish fashion house has overtaken sportswear group Nike as number one in the apparel rankings. Behind it was Calvin Klein, up 52 per cent at $1.8bn.“Zara is relevant because it is affordable fashion, being delivered very quickly and then expanding that into the wider regions,” says Mr Walshe. “It’s a good example of a company investing in the brand and exporting that difference to relevant segments and markets.”Also highlighting a bigger theme is the ascent of Amazon, the online retailer, which rose 34 per cent to $45.7bn, overtaking the far less virtual Walmart: a classic tale of clicks winning out over bricks.“We saw bricks suffering but now there is the advance of the clicks” says Mr Walshe. “But also Amazon has been more fleet of foot and maybe it is easier [to move from online to physical than vice versa] because it does not already have existing infrastructure, so can create something more cost efficient in the first place.”It is the first time such a gap has opened up between Amazon and Walmart.At $9bn, that gap is the equivalent of Aldi – the German discount store whose brand value has slipped lower even as its popularity with Europe’s cash-strapped shoppers surges – that is wedged between them.
301;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Global retailers pledge help for Bangladesh factory victims;;Western retailers have begun pledging compensation for Bangladeshi garment workers killed or injured in last week’s building collapse as rescuers abandoned hope of finding any more survivors.The official death toll from the collapse of the Rana Plaza, which housed five garment factories producing for many major Western retail brands, passed 400 on Wednesday according to police, with hundreds more suffering from severe injuries.Officers said 399 bodies had been pulled from the debris and three of the injured had died in hospital. Authorities expect to find many more dead bodies – possibly hundreds – as they dig through to the bottom of the mountain of concrete and iron.With an intense global spotlight now on their business ties in Bangladesh, Western retailers that used suppliers housed in the doomed building have begun offering ill-defined compensation to the victims.But aid groups have been unimpressed by some of the vague promises such as UK discount retailer Matalan’s pledge to “provide financial and other support”. The offer to those affected fell short of meeting victims’ rights, said War on Want.“Matalan’s words of sympathy will be cold comfort to those affected without action that would ensure such a disaster never happens again,” said Ruth Tanner, campaigns and policy director at the anti-poverty charity.Ethical Trade Initiative, an alliance of companies, trade unions and voluntary organisations, said it would be a “travesty” if brands did not seize the opportunity to work to effect changes in working practices with the government, which had been shaken into action by the disaster.“Now there is an opportunity for the international partners, brands and retailers and labour organisations to say, let’s work with you, government, and hold you accountable for putting in appropriate changes to the industry,” said Peter McAllister, director at ETI. “If we don’t take that opportunity, there will be new disasters and that will be an indictment on everyone involved.”Matalan said it was not using any suppliers based in the building but a spokeswoman said a previous supplier was based there in February. Primark, British discount retailer, which early on acknowledged its use of suppliers at a factory in the Rana Plaza, was the first Western brand to pledge compensation to the dead and injured employees of its supplier.In a statement this week, Primark, owned by UK-listed Associated British Foods, promised “long-term aid for children who have lost parents, financial aid for those injured and payments to the families of the deceased”.Primark noted that many other major Western brands were purchasing stock from factories located in the building. “We are fully aware of our responsibility,” it said.Subsequently, Canada’s Loblaw, which had a supplier of products for its Joe Fresh clothing brand at a factory in the building, said it too was going to provide compensation for the families of victims employed by its supplier.In a statement, Loblaw said that it was still working on the specific details of how to deliver this support in the “best and most meaningful way possible”, but that the company’s goal was to ensure that “victims and their families receive benefits now and in the future”.But even as some retailers are offering aid, other brands have sought to distance themselves from the tragedy. Mango, for example, whose orders for children’s leggings were found in the wreckage of the building by the Financial Times, said it had only placed a “trial order” with one of the factories there. One surviving manager of that factory though said that workers had been trying hard to complete the order, which had prompted them to go back despite the discovery of the crack.Mr McAllister said: “Frankly it’s a travesty that some of the other brands have not been as proactive as Primark.”Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s $19bn export-oriented garment industry, which has seen its business badly hit by disruptive political turmoil in the past few months, is struggling to reassure Western retailers and their buyers that it remains a reliable credible supplier.On Monday, representatives of 35 major Western brands and buyers met the leaders of the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the industry body, and they agreed to form a panel to lay down a plan to address safety issues.In the meantime, the BGMEA this week instructed all its members to have their factory buildings examined by structural engineers and submit proof of these inspections by the end of this month.Additional reporting by Joseph Allchin in Dhaka, Barney Jopson in New York and Louise Lucas in London
302;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-04-26T17:24:20Z;A question of sportswear;Clothes endorsed by sports stars may not help your game but can they make you look cool?;"For an armchair spectator, it’s hard not to engage in a little fantasy football of the personal kind. With the right diet, trainer and, perhaps most importantly, the right kit, could we all achieve greatness? At least relatively speaking?We’re often told that the indomitable Corinthian spirit lives in the heart and the will – but if its proven possessors and their marketing departments are to be believed, some of it can be communicated through trousers. As a cider-drinking couch potato who gets breathless on a Boris bike and whose tennis racket is so out of use that the wood has warped, I reckoned myself the ideal test subject. When I get on a cross trainer, I actually get cross. So here’s the question: could wearing the pants of David Beckham or the trackie bottoms of Björn Borg really make me thinner, leaner, faster and more determined?“Eighty-five per cent of habitual wearers of sportswear are morbidly obese,” my brother announced when I told him of my experiment, sourcing his claim somewhat unconvincingly to the New Scientist. Indeed, it’s unclear how much of this gear is actually intended to be used for the playing of sport and how much is meant to be a style statement.Certainly there are mixed messages involved. Consider Bradley Wiggins’ branded kit for Fred Perry. Are we talking tennis, cycling or Northern Soul revival nights at the pub? The label itself doesn’t give us much help, announcing – like a robot that has just about digested the relevant Wikipedia entries – that “the cycling shirt remains a classic retro sports fashion crossover style and given Wiggins’ own modernist credentials, the range references this unique link between sport and subculture”. Huh. This translates as some well-made, Aertex-style collared T-shirts (£90) with retro metal zips at the neck (the authentic 1970s sort that feel cold and nip your skin), and stripes at the neck and cuffs.Also mining the fiercely retro scratchy metal zip seam is the Björn Borg range. Remember him? He’s still alive, according to Wikipedia, and selling a whole mess o’ clothing, though the one thing I’d hoped for – a fat, mullet-restraining towelling sweatband – wasn’t present among the samples. Climb into his gear and it’s the 1980s all over again.His trad black-and-white tracksuit (jacket £80/joggers £70) is the old-school kind made of thick cotton with zip pockets (keep these done up or all your change will fall down the side of the sofa as soon as you sit down) and a giant shoelace to cinch in the waist. They’re versatile: comfy for a casual game of tennis and ideal, too, for sitting on the sofa eating crisps. Borg trainers (£80) are pared-down old-school cool: probably more for the street than the court if you’re a serious player (they’ve got about as much bounce in them as Green Flash). They have flat green soles, white uppers and fat white laces – a double-stripe of white-on-white and a discreet autograph under the ankle. Made in Vietnam and best viewed through sunglasses. I didn’t get the chance to try out the underwear but the former tennis star flogs a lot of that too. In fact, the website invites you to “get ready for unforgettable nights with our special party pants”, so I pass on the invitation.Meanwhile, Nike, as if glowering at Borg across the white tape and the generations, offers a range of Roger Federer stuff. The two least perturbable men in tennis history – one a diehard baseliner; the other the owner of probably the most rounded game in history – and here are their T-shirts! I put a V-necked Federer T (£25; his clothes are even blander than his interviews, I’m afraid – except the grey and pink polyester polo shirt, £48, which is candidly hideous) over a Borg T-shirt (£30), just to see the clash. Apart from the faint desire to stand in no-man’s land playing a one-and-a-half-handed backhand, however, all I got was sweaty.Did I mention Rio Ferdinand has his own shoes too? I tried a soft black leather number, apparently called a “Rory fashion trainer” (£120). Essentially what you’d get if a brogue got a soft upper, a stiff rubber sole and a small metal plate (suitable, you’d think, for the door of a tiny doctor’s surgery) on the outside upper announcing “Five by Rio Ferdinand”. Fine for a nightclub, but I wouldn’t try it for football.Then there’s Kobe “Black Mamba” Bryant’s range of gear, also for Nike. I confess, I don’t play much basketball, and I can’t imagine all that much basketball will get played in the UK in this stuff. But it’s definitely sportswear. There’s a comfy pair of lightweight trainers (£110) in an electric blue-and-purple material that looks like the carpet from the lobby of a Premier Inn, and a pair of knee-length basketball shorts (£33) in muted tones. The shorts were flappy, and lightweight enough not to impede my legs as I pounded manfully through the park, and the trainers had a real bounce in the heels. Warming down, I donned a black-and-grey hoodie (£55) with shiny snakeskin-effect detailing on the arms in which, apparently, I resemble a turtle, according to a “friend” (real friends don’t call other friends turtles). Wearing this stuff, I have never felt more white. Others – younger, cooler, blacker – may carry it off better.Surprisingly, the standout gear, as far as I was concerned, was H&M’s line of David Beckham-branded togs (from £7.99). The pants we all know about – nicely elasticated boxer briefs suitable, as the TV adverts suggest, for pelting through a series of Beverly Hills back gardens with nothing else on. Dandy. But there’s also a really nice and understated cotton-elastane three-button grandad shirt (£19.99) and a moss-coloured vest in stretchy ribbed cotton (£9.99): long, flaring slightly at the bottom and snug around the pecs. When you first put it on, and it gives your moobs a squeeze – I fancy that it lifts and separates – you get the pleasantly homoerotic sense that Beckham himself may be clasping you from behind.As far as style went, after a fortnight of my forsaking the usual Doc Martens, collared shirts and cardigans for hoodies, tracksuits and trainers, my wife astonished me by saying she (somewhat) approved of the transformation: “Amazing how different you look when you wear different clothes.” Better? “Kinda.” She actually liked the look. My mum, less so.It was, anyway, just so attired – vest and pants of Beckham, trainers of Borg, cycling shirt of Wiggo and hoodie of Black Mamba – and feeling super-confident that I challenged my brother (who has thrashed me since he was 14) to a set of tennis. “Can’t,” he said apologetically, gesturing down at his faded jeans and leather street shoes. “Haven’t got the right gear.”——————————————-www.fredperry.comwww.bjornborg.comwww.nike.comwww.javari.co.ukwww.hm.comwww.ft.com/stylestockists"
303;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Teen golfer changes the face of Chinese sport;Prodigy’s rise reflects affluent class growth;Guan Tianlang has become the latest Chinese hero to make sporting history after the 14-year-old golfer played his way to the distinction of being the youngest ever competitor in Masters history.But the teenage amateur’s background is far from the typical rags-to-riches, product of a state sporting system story usually preferred by the Communist party. And that has not escaped the notice of many Chinese social media users.His achievement drew the usual congratulations and expressions of national pride on Weibo, the Twitter-like microblogging site which has millions of users in China. “@guantianlang, you are the hope of golf in China,” offered one user on Friday.There were, however, also those who saw a different significance in Guan’s success in capitalism’s favourite game.“This is rich people’s playthings,” grumbled one Weibo user on Friday.“He has got to be a rich family kid,” said another.The plush surroundings of Lion Lake Country Club in Guangzhou, where Mr Guan took up the game and has worked hard to perfect it, are indeed in stark contrast to the bare walls of the government academies where China churns out its Olympians.The course is a playground for China’s swelling country club class. A single weekend round at the club costs about a quarter of the province’s average monthly salary. “Almost all [members] are middle class or above,” said Bao Jiuhui, deputy manager at the club.According to Susan Huang, a reporter for Golf Digest’s Hong Kong edition, Guan Tianlang is part of a new generation of teenage golfers in China. In the southern city of Shenzhen alone there are 70-80 teenage golfers competing regularly, she says, and teenagers are a common sight on the links in other big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.But the young Guan remains unusual, according to Ms Huang. He started professional training at an early age and has been competing with adults for years.That pedigree has shone through at the Masters. The gangly teenager shot 73 in his first round on Thursday to remain in contention for the weekend’s final two rounds, despite being penalised a shot on Friday for slow play. His partner – two-times Masters winner Ben Crenshaw – shot 81. “He played like a veteran today,” Mr Crenshaw declared afterwards.Mr Guan is not wholly unknown in his homeland. His 20,000 followers on Weibo is impressive for a 14-year old but he lags far behind China’s sporting superstars, such as tennis player Li Na, who has more than 21m followers.As a new affluent class has grown in China over the past two decades so too has the popularity of golf. Amid controversy over shady land deals, the government has repeatedly tried to ban the construction of new courses at times. But that has done little to stymie the growth of the sport.With golf set to feature at the 2016 Olympics, both the sport and its sponsors will be hoping Guan Tianlang is another catalyst for growth.The course ahead is likely to have its challenges. Golf is riddled with tales of teenage prodigies who promised much but failed to cut it as professionals, often wilting under the pressure of sponsor expectations.“He has to play the long game from a commercial point of view, and do fewer, bigger endorsements,” says Andy Sutherden, global practice director at Hill+Knowlton, the branding consultancy. “Put golf first, second and third.”Tiger Woods’ own path from prodigy to a veteran trying to overcome the disintegration of his personal life offers one cautionary tale.The career of Michelle Wie, an American of Korean descent who qualified for her first major amateur tournament on the ladies tour aged 10 and turned professional at 16, offers a less dramatic example. She has signed multimillion-dollar deals with the likes of Nike and Sony. But she has not won a major championship.Keeping the number of commitments in check may end up being the key to future success for Guan Tianlang. He should concentrate on signing a small number of deals with large sponsors, warns Mr Sutherden. “If he ends up with 15 different sponsors off the back of this, the next thing you know, he’ll be another boom and bust case study.”Additional reporting Li Wan in Beijing
304;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-04-10T08:22:53Z;China: Michael Jordan faces counter-suit in name dispute;;"Chinese sportswear company Qiaodan has long been seen as a copycat for its use of a name and imagery connected to basketball legend Michael Jordan. But in the domain of trademark law, it is nothing if not original in an increasingly bitter fight with Jordan.Jordan sued Qiaodan last year for unauthorized use of his name (Jordan was extremely popular in China when he played from 1984-2003 and Qiaodan is the Chinese transliteration of his surname). Qiaodan has now launched a countersuit against Jordan, alleging that his legal action damaged its reputation.That’s not all, though. “Michael Jordan’s lawsuit in February 2012 stopped the company from being listed,” a Qiaodan spokesman told state media. Qiaodan’s claim is that it was on the brink of going public on the Chinese stock market when the Jordan lawsuit forced it to put its plans on hold.The Chinese sportswear industry is crowded, competitive and over-supplied, with companies like Li Ning, Peak, Anta, Xtep and 361 doing battle with global powers Nike and Adidas. Jordan’s Chinese name has helped Qiaodan, founded in the 1980s, carve out some space for itself.But Qiaodan did not just stop at his name. It also featured his number 23 in some earlier products and continues to use the silhouette of a basketball player strikingly similar in appearance to Jordan as a logo on its shoes.When he filed the lawsuit last year, Jordan said in a statement: “It is deeply disappointing to see a company build a business off my Chinese name without my permission.”Qiaodan’s response is that it is just a big misunderstanding. It “simply used a Chinese translation of what it considers a common foreign family name,” according to the China Daily.The company did not immediately reply to a beyondbrics request for an interview.It said in a previous statement that its brand name was recognised in 2005 and again in 2009 as a “famous national trademark” by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.Qiaodan is seeking damages of $8m from Jordan. It filed its claim on April 2 in the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court in the southeastern province of Fujian, where it is based. No decision has been reached yet in Jordan’s lawsuit against Qiaodan, which is being heard at a court in Shanghai.For the Chinese government, the war of the Jordans is shaping up as a test of its commitment to fair play in the court of trademarks.Related reading:

305;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-04-05T15:28:47Z;Eat, sleep … share?;The idea of wearing a gadget that tracks and transmits data on your biorhythms sounds horribly intrusive;"A couple of weeks ago, I spotted a curious grey bracelet on the wrist of one of New York’s hottest media figures. It was a striking design, slick and neat. But it was not intended to be just a fashion statement, or a tribute to a worthy philanthropic cause. Instead, this particular person, whom I shall call Andy, recently started using this plastic device to track – constantly – the movements of his body, in terms of how much he exercises, eats and sleeps. Each day he not only peruses that data himself, but also uploads it on to a site where it can be monitored by all his friends.“We can see the stats on each other,” Andy explained, as he pulled out a phone and showed me screens displaying the vital data on his circle of bracelet-wearing friends (a group of east and west coast hedge fund types, lawyers, entrepreneurs and so on). Apparently, this group of professionals are now obsessively watching what time they sleep, how many times they wake in the night, and how many hours of deep slumber each person enjoys.“It’s the new thing,” Andy added, with a laugh. Wearing these badges – which are made by companies such as Nike and Jawbone – has become a token of pride among his peers.Opinions among FT readers will undoubtedly be sharply divided about this trend. To many observers, the idea of wearing a gadget that tracks and transmits data on your biorhythms sounds horribly intrusive. We live in a world where the majority of us are already being constantly monitored during our waking hours. If machines can now track our sleep too, this creates new levels of potential surveillance – and doubly so, given the ability of companies and governments to monitor the internet.But the bracelet-wearing tribe begs to differ. Wearing these monitors is voluntary, they argue. “No one is forced to share their information, it’s optional,” points out Joseph Teegardin, Nike spokesman. Moreover, there can be personal and social benefits: peer pressure can be a powerful motivational factor to encourage a healthier lifestyle – and some research suggests that people who start wearing these electronic bracelets apparently do 25 per cent more exercise than before.“Those who do share find it helps them to stay motivated,” Teegarden adds. Indeed, the potential health benefits are so significant that some schools in America are starting to introduce them for children – and a few large companies are offering them to employees too. What smacks of George Orwell to some, in other words, looks like sound public policy to others – or, more accurately, a clever way to reduce healthcare costs.However, what also fascinates me is the cultural irony here. Twenty years ago, before I became a journalist, I spent a great deal of time thinking (and fretting) about concepts of privacy. Back then I was working as a cultural anthropologist in communities in Tibet and Tajikistan, where attitudes to personal space were very different.Most notably, when I was growing up as a child in England, I assumed that people would always prefer to sleep in private, unless they were with a romantic partner. To be sure, children would sometimes share bedrooms; but when somebody “grew up”, they would usually choose to sleep in their own bedroom and bed – if they had the economic means.However, people in Tibet and Tajikistan had different assumptions. Each night, piles of people would all sleep in the same room, or tent. If somebody was not sleeping or eating well, it became a matter of wider knowledge and debate. Personally, I found that extremely intrusive. And until recently, I vaguely assumed that societies tended to shed this group pattern when they got richer and more technologically advanced. After all, the broad sweep of history suggests that most cultures have become more individualistic over time, as wealth gives people more freedom to break away from the group.But the digital revolution could be shaking these assumptions. Never mind the fact that the younger generation today has an obsessive need to keep communicating via Twitter and Facebook, or post information online with scant concern for privacy. If young professionals in places such as San Francisco and New York now think it is “cool” to post their sleeping patterns to each other, then it would appear that the concept of cultural progress has come full circle. Suddenly we are all back in a giant electronic tent together – or at least Andy and some of his elite, wealthy friends are.Of course, as the companies themselves keep stressing, there is one key difference: these bracelet-wearing fitness addicts – unlike Tajik villagers, say – have a choice about whether or not to remain exposed. But if nothing else, the spread of that Jawbone UP or Nike FuelBand is one more sign of the degree to which most of us want to remain inside a social group – even (or especially) in our disembodied cyber age, when sleep has become one of the most precious commodities of all.gillian.tett@ft.com"
306;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-03-28T20:27:27Z;BlackBerry jumps on strong earnings;Utilities, healthcare and transport among gainers;Wall Street wrapped up the holiday-shortened week on a more upbeat note after the S&P 500 rose through its all-time closing high, buoyed by an improving outlook for the US economy.A scrambled bailout for Cyprus, fears of contagion in the eurozone and mixed corporate results in the US weighed on benchmark stock indices for most of the week, as investors favoured the perceived safety of Treasury bonds and the dollar.But on Thursday, the S&P 500 finally broke through its previous closing high at 1,565.15 to end the session at a record 1,569.19. For the week, the index rose 0.8 per cent.Since hitting an intraday low of 666.79 in March 2009, the broad measure of US stocks has rallied 135 per cent, boosted by aggressive monetary easing by the Federal Reserve and record US profits from the 500 constituents in the index.This week’s push came in the aftermath of mixed government data that showed US economic growth slowed less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, but jobless claims rose to their highest level in one month.The blue-chip Dow Jones also advanced and traded 0.4 per cent higher on the week to 14,577.69. The index first surpassed its 2007 all-time high on March 5.The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.6 per cent on the week to 3,267.52. US markets were closed for Good Friday and will resume trading on Monday.US growth data for the fourth quarter of 2012 was revised up again to an annualised rate of 0.4 per cent, providing evidence that the economy did not take a dip at the end of last year. The revision came after an initial estimate that the economy shrank by 0.1 per cent.But in another report on Thursday, the Labour Department said first-time jobless claims rose by 16,000 to 357,000 in the week ended March 23, the highest level in a month.Christopher Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said: “Net, net, GDP is old news with consumers revised down a little and business capital expenditures and commercial real estate construction stronger. Unemployment claims revised upward the last few months, but with a stronger trend of improvement. Things are better than we think.”Throughout the week, utilities and healthcare stocks were among leading gainers, while companies in the basic materials and energy sectors lagged behind.Some of the highlights came from companies such as Best Buy. The stock initially jumped on news the company founder and largest individual shareholder, Richard Schulze, will be returning to the company as chairman emeritus. Analysts said the move could be viewed as an endorsement of the company’s turnround plan. But a “sell” recommendation from S&P Capital IQ weighed on the stock, which traded 2.7 per cent lower for the week to $22.15.Dell was also in focus this week. Blackstone and investor Carl Icahn both tabled competing offers for the PC maker, which Michael Dell and Silver Lake plan to take private in a $24.4bn deal. Blackstone made an offer of at least $14.25 a share for the whole company, while Mr Icahn is looking to pay $15 a share for 58 per cent of the company.Both offers are superior to the $13.65 a share offer from Mr Dell and Silver Lake on a per-share basis, and helped push the stock 1.3 per cent higher on the week to $14.33.In earning news, BlackBerry initially jumped more than 4 per cent to $15.20 after reporting fourth-quarter results, but the stock ended the week 3.1 per cent lower at $14.44.

For the week, the S&P registered a decline of 0.2 per cent, breaking a run of three consecutive weekly gains.FedEx incurred a weekly loss of 9.7 per cent to $98.48 after the package delivery company cut its full-year forecast in the wake of third-quarter net income dropping 31 per cent.That weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday.Transports slipped 1.5 per cent this week, trimming their 2013 gain to 16.4 per cent, still handily beating the major US indices.Oracle dropped 12 per cent to $31.98 for the week after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts.The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.Among the major S&P sectors this week, consumer staples led with a gain of 2.1 per cent while financials lost 1.5 per cent while materials dropped 2 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.6 per cent higher at 14,512.03, having touched a new intraday record high of 14,546.82 earlier this week. That left the blue-chip barometer a fraction lower on the week, its first such loss in five weeks.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 3,244.99, for a loss of 0.1 per cent since Monday.The first-quarter earnings season kicks into gear next month and could determine whether the S&P 500 can break its 2007 closing high of 1,565.15.The estimated earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies during the first quarter is minus 0.7 per cent, according to FactSet.“While analysts expect little if any earnings growth for the first quarter of 2013, they do predict earnings growth will rebound to double-digit levels in the second half of 2013,” said John Butters, analyst at FactSet.James Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel, said the S&P remains on track to break its 2007 high, citing the momentum of money coming into the market for dividend paying and value stocks.“People that need income are looking for stocks that provide them with an actual cash flow yield,” he said.But with uncertainty swirling in the eurozone over Cyprus and with fiscal policy in the US, equities could struggle for momentum in March.“These increased risks are likely to cause stock markets to struggle in the near term and prompt profit taking after the strong gains thus far in 2013,” said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investment Advisors.Among other shares in the earnings spotlight this week, weaker guidance from Guess saw its shares drop 7.5 per cent to $25.09.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.7 per cent to $49.83.Adobe booked a weekly rise of 3.8 per cent to $42.97 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rallied 4.1 per cent to $48.15 on the week after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.

309;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Nike soars but China is its Achilles heel;;Price rises and cheaper material costs helped Nike to report better than expected profits in the past quarter, but China remained a weak spot as sales there continued to fall.The US sportswear maker’s net income rose 16 per cent to $662m in the quarter to February 28, compared with expectations of $610m. Revenues were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn, in line with Wall Street forecasts.But in China sales fell 9 per cent to $635m as it continued to grapple with the consequences of excess inventory, bad product choices and slowing economic growth, problems that have bedevilled other sports retailers in the country.The stock market nonetheless focused on its rising profit margin and welcomed the results, pushing Nike shares up 7.9 per cent to $57.85 in after-market trading once its results were released.The Oregon-based group attributed the rise in its profitability to increases in product prices as well as lower raw material costs, which it said offset higher labour costs in its manufacturing operations.Faye Landes, analyst at Cowen & Co, said: “This is a very solid quarter. The gross margin [improvement] is particularly encouraging.”She noted that not every company was able to raise prices without alienating customers. “The shoes are just exactly what people want,” she said.In China, Nike said it needed a few more quarters to fix its problems by clearing existing inventory and improving its merchandise.Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, said: “All of these efforts are going to take some time. So we are being aggressive where we can and patient where we must . . . We’re not taking any shortcuts in China.”Nike also disclosed its new orders for delivery from March to July, but although a 4 per cent rise in orders in China appeared to be an encouraging sign, the company warned that it would not lead to equally high revenue growth.Despite persistent economic weakness in western Europe, the region emerged as an unexpected bright spot in Nike’s results, with revenues that increased by 8 per cent from a year ago to $1bn.Mr Denson said he was “bullish” on western Europe. While Italy, Spain and Portugal remained weak markets, he said Nike was doing better than it had done for a while in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia.Nike’s profits were also boosted by a lower tax rate, which was due largely to the reinstatement of a US research and development tax credit in the 11th-hour deal to avoid the fiscal cliff at the end of 2012.

311;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
312;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Adidas in China: reaching out;;"If there is one thing that China’s smaller cities do not lack, it’s sportswear stores. The average fourth-, fifth- and sixth-tier Chinese city – everyone defines their tiers differently – has a high street with multiple Chinese sportswear retailers lined up in a row. Do these towns really need more running shoes?Adidas certainly thinks so and its latest greater China sales – up 15 per cent in 2012 – seem to indicate that it’s right. The German sportswear brand, currently number two by sales behind Nike, has expanded into 350 more Chinese cities in the past 18 months, to 900 in total. Of the 800 stores opened last year, 400 were in lower-tier cities. The goal is to have 1,400 cities buying Adidas by 2015.How low can they go? Colin Currie, Adidas greater China managing director, says China’s smaller cities still have plenty to give: “consumers in lower-tier cities have a lot more time to participate in activities that do not cost a lot, like running,” he says, adding that “there is not so much choice in lower-tier cities in apparel so it’s ok to wear sportswear for going to work or even a wedding”.More sophisticated big city Chinese consumers would, like their counterparts in the West, almost certainly eschew a tracksuit as wedding attire. But in China, sportswear – especially foreign sportswear – is viewed as almost a luxury good: an aspirational rather than a practical buy, as the admen would say.And that’s where another sportswear shop on the high street may make perfect sense: buying a pair of shoes from one of China’s multitude of virtually interchangeable sportswear brands, who have severely fragmented the market and cannibalised each other’s margins, just does not have the same cachet as buying Nike or Adidas. And though famous foreign brand logos have begun to lose their overwhelming appeal in big cities, the smaller cities are still mad keen on them.Multinationals, take note: all of you are counting on China’s lower-tier cities to deliver the growth that is no longer possible in the near-saturated big cities. Let’s see how Adidas fares, in cities where many residents are just a few steps away from farm and field. If Adidas can make it work, there may be hope for the rest of you.Related reading

313;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-03-07T15:49:26Z;Reebok charge dents growth at Adidas;;Adidas took a €265m impairment charge because of weakness at its Reebok brand, but Europe’s largest sports goods maker by sales forecast solid growth in 2013.The German group was pushed into a small quarterly loss, but said earnings per share should grow by between 12 per cent and 16 per cent this year, after underlying earnings grew 29 per cent in 2012. Sales, which climbed 6 per cent last year to €14.9bn, should also grow by a mid-single-digit amount, Adidas said.The group, number two in global sales of sports goods behind Nike of the US, said it would raise its dividend for last year by 35 per cent. Its shares climbed more than 4 per cent in Frankfurt to €75.07.Adidas has mapped out a plan to raise sales to €17bn in 2015, but last year it substantially lowered the expectations for the contribution Reebok was expected to make, from €3bn of sales to €2bn.Reebok, acquired by Adidas for $3.8bn in 2005, has been a source of multiple problems, including poor sales in the US, a strike in ice hockey, with which the brand is linked, and irregularities at the company’s Indian unit last year.While Adidas brand sales grew 10 per cent in 2012, Reebok sales fell 18 per cent. “We are obviously disappointed but we have seen [Reebok] stabilise,” said Herbert Hainer, chief executive.Adidas had dropped plans to sell its ice hockey business because offers were not good enough, Mr Hainer said.Robin Stalker, chief financial officer, said there had been significant overstatement of Reebok sales and profits in India over several years. Adidas restated its 2011 accounts, lowering net income by €58m.Included in the €265m charge in the fourth quarter, which was mostly caused by lower assumed growth at Reebok, was the complete impairment of €68m of goodwill on Reebok-CCM Hockey. A €24m impairment was attributed to Rockport, another brand owned by Adidas. In total, goodwill on the balance sheet had been cut by 17 per cent, Mr Stalker said.For the fourth quarter, Adidas reported a net €7m loss compared with €3m of income a year ago. Excluding goodwill impairment, operating profit was €26m compared with €18m last year. Quarterly sales grew 1 per cent.Andreas Riemann, analyst at Commerzbank, said: “Results were negatively affected by tough comparisons and lower Reebok sales . . . However, the gross margin did well, inventories are well under control and net cash was up strongly.”Annual net income fell from €613m in 2011 to €526m, representing earnings per share of €2.52. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings per share grew 29 per cent to €3.78.Net income in 2013 may rise to between €890m and €920m, Adidas said.
314;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-02-28T21:48:48Z;Facebook buys ad-serving platform;;Facebook has finalised a deal with Microsoft to buy Atlas Solutions, an ad-serving platform that will help the social network measure the effectiveness of ads placed on its site and others.Such technology is key to prove to marketers that buying ads on Facebook leads to increased sales, metrics it could then rely on to convince advertisers to buy more ads, or to increase the cost of those ads.“Advertisers have been asking for better measurement,” said Brian Boland, Facebook’s director of monetisation product marketing. The acquisition of Atlas “gets us further down the path of what advertisers are asking for”.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although the purchase price was reportedly much lower than the $6bn Microsoft paid for Atlas when it acquired its parent company aQuantive in 2007.The main advantage of Atlas’s technology is measuring how ads on Facebook perform compared to similar ads on other sites. The next step for the company is to tie those measurements to consumers’ purchasing activity.Facebook is already tracking the connection between ads that users see on its site and purchases they make in store, through its partnership with data mining firm Datalogix. .With the Atlas technology, it will also be able to track ads the same users see on other news and shopping sites, to get a fuller picture of what impressions gained in various places lead to a purchase.For example, if Nike wanted to promote a new pair of shoes, it might buy ads on various sites, including Facebook, ESPN and the Financial Times, and platforms including desktop computer, tablet and mobile phone. With the Atlas technology, Facebook will be able to see when and where one of its users saw an ad. It will track if they saw the ad while surfing Facebook on their phone, or reading the FT on their computer.If that person goes to a Nike store to buy the shoes, or does a Google search, clicks on an ad for the shoes and buys them online, Facebook will be able to track that too, and give itself, and the other sites, credit for leading to the purchase.Facebook calls this “multi-touch attribution”, as opposed to “last touch attribution”, which gives all the credit for the purchase to Google for hosting the final ad the customer clicked on before buying.The Atlas team will continue to work out of its Seattle offices, with Facebook planning to build the engineering and products teams. One of its main priorities will be boosting the system’s capacity for tracking mobile ads.Analysts expect Facebook will use Atlas to build tools that will refine its ability to target ads on its site and across the web, echoing a trajectory successfully pursued by Google.Nate Elliott, an analyst with Forrester, said Facebook could combine the data it had collected about people’s affinities and preferences with new advertising tools to powerful effect.“The question now is how quickly and successfully Facebook can integrate its data with Atlas’s tools, and whether they can avoid a privacy backlash as they do so,” he said. “History suggests they’ll struggle on both counts.”

William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, attributed strong year-to-date performance of equity markets to reduced headline and macro risks, better than expected corporate earnings and early signs that economic growth is improving early in 2013.However, he cautioned that these improvements were fragile: “More work out of US and European policy makers is needed to maintain positive momentum.”Given that the sequestration – automatic spending cuts of about $85bn in the fiscal 2013 year – is only two weeks away, it seems that markets have not fully priced in the possibility.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,517.01 but has gained more than 6 per cent since the beginning of the year and was still hovering near its five-year highs reached last week. On Monday, seven of 10 major sectors finished in negative territory with losses led by energy stocks.Oil and gas exploration companies were hardest hit with Noble Energy shares falling 2.3 per cent to $112.75 and WPX Energy shares down 2.3 per cent to $15.27. Southwestern Energy lost 2.6 per cent to $33.59.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading 0.2 per cent lower at 13,967.55, having failed to move beyond the 14,000 level during the past few weeks.Moody’s shares rose 4.9 per cent to $45.49, after heavy losses last week.

But initial excitement fizzled out and shares were 1.2 per cent higher at $55.22.BlackBerry shares dropped sharply and closed 4.6 per cent lower at $15.73. Shares in the BlackBerry maker have been volatile after the launch of its new Z10 and Q10 smartphones, as investors are still not sure whether the company will recover its market share and be able to compete with Apple and android devices.Banking stocks attracted buyers and sent the S&P 500 financials index 0.4 per cent higher.Wells Fargo shares rose 1.1 per cent to $35.26 after analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to “buy”.Citigroup and Bank of America shares also rose, adding 1.1 per cent to $43.15 and 0.9 per cent to $11.86 respectively.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was lagging behind the broader market but has still gained 5.5 per cent since beginning of January.

The best performing mutual fund manager last year thanks to big bets on unloved stocks, he says the world’s largest listed company could be worth 50 per cent more.The technology giant’s share price has dropped more than a third from its September peak, as earnings growth has faltered. “Most people are worried about Apple perhaps ending up like Nokia or RIM, once-hot product companies that have fallen on hard times,” says Mr Miller.In his opinion, “Apple is much more like Nike, a consumer brand with great loyalty”. It is a typically contrarian and optimistic view from the 63-year-old former military intelligence officer, who appears to be enjoying a second youth as stock picking comes back into fashion, rescuing a reputation as both one of the best and one of the worst investors of recent decades.From 1991 to 2005 Mr Miller beat the US stock market every year in an unmatched 15-year run at the head of Legg Mason’s flagship mutual fund.The financial crisis was unkind, however, and when in late 2011 he announced he would step down it was the worst performer over five years, behind more than 800 peers, according to Lipper, a research group.Mr Miller did not retire though. He continued to run the $1.1bn Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, and last year produced a blistering 40 per cent return for its investors as the unloved housebuilders and financial stocks he favoured came back into fashion.A value investor, but one with an eye for growth, he says housing was the biggest contributor to his success last year, after he snapped up stocks such as PulteGroup during the market turmoil of 2011.Such wild opportunities are not on offer today. “The stocks are maybe a little bit ahead of themselves,” says Mr Miller. But he invokes the opinion of his co-portfolio manager Samantha McLemore: “Try and find another sector where you can pretty much guarantee at least 25 per cent earnings growth a year for the next five years.”Indeed, while that view is based on fundamental improvement in the housing market, with land prices up, rising prices in most cities and “affordability at a 50-year low”, Mr Miller predicts a building boom that will rival the last bubble in its magnitude.He says there is a big structural demand for homes due to a growing population and a lack of building during the bust, when fewer than 500,000 new homes a year were built. The long-term trend is for 1.4m to 1.5m new homes a year, so to catch up “we probably need to get to 2m housing starts at some point in the next five years”.Such long-term optimism is in part what helped the value investor to embrace technology in the 1990s, and he remains a fan of the big technology names “priced with no regard to the underlying fundamentals”.For instance, were Apple to keep all $137bn on its balance sheet and just put future free cash flow into the dividend, “that alone would put the stock up close to 50 per cent”.Cash too, he sees as a solution to concern about Microsoft and the death of the PC business. “Just like any large trend, people have a tendency to overdiscount it. It's a mature business without a great deal of innovation, but it’s a type of business that's going to be around for a long time.”The company has raised its dividend by 15 per cent annually for five years, but “Microsoft has $85bn in cash and no stated capital allocation policy”. If it were like the more shareholder-friendly Texas Instruments, which aggressively bought back stock during the crisis, it would at least be valued in line with the broader market, he says.Mr Miller embraces stock market darlings as well though, continuing to be a fan of Amazon, the online retailer that has put expanding its sales far above actual profits. Mr Miller says the opportunity in web services could be at least as big as the company’s retail business and operating margins near zero could be 10 per cent in the long term. “By the end of this year, the start of next year, I think margins will start to rise again,” he says.The investor does think his job has become harder. “ High-frequency trading has added a lot more noise to the market. Two-thirds of activity has nothing to do with fundamentals,” obscuring price signals by real money buyers and sellers.But Mr Miller says it is “becoming a better environment for stock pickers. When the world is preoccupied with macro the way we tend to invest doesn’t add much value.”And to that end, his chief concern remains the chance of a Washington-inspired upset as negotiations continue to raise the debt ceiling and agree spending cuts. “The biggest threat to the markets and the economy is Congress.”
317;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Li Ning tumbles on fundraising plan;;Li Ning, the struggling Chinese sportswear retailer that is one of the mainland’s best-known homegrown brands, sent its shares tumbling by revealing it needed to raise more money to complete a restructuring plan.Its share price sank 14.7 per cent on Friday after the company said it plans to issue convertible securities worth up to HK$1.87bn (US$241m) to provide capital for restructuring and business development, as it tries to reverse a two-year slide in its performance. The securities are convertible into one share at HK$3.50 each and will be offered to shareholders for every two existing shares held.“They are in a lot of trouble, and this latest news shows the situation is even worse than we thought,” said Shaun Rein of China Market Research in Shanghai. “They may not be able to continue as a standalone concern in a year or two,” he said.“We are at a critical point in executing our plans and transforming our business,” said Li Ning, the former Olympic gymnast and company founder.The company said its backers TPG, the US private equity fund, and GIC, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, would subscribe to the offer. TPG last year installed one of its partners at the helm in an effort to engineer a turnround.“The additional capital to be raised through the open offer and continued support from key stakeholders will ensure a stable platform while we work to restore the group to sustainable growth and profitability in the long term and step into a new phase of our development,” Mr Li said.The company has been plagued by inventory overhang since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It has been further hurt by surging competition in the Chinese sportswear sector, where Li Ning competes not just with foreign brands such as Adidas and Nike, but also with a plethora of domestic rivals.Li Ning last month announced that it would post a substantial loss for 2012, blaming the rising competition and inventory problems coupled with a slowdown in the mainland economy.However, “Li Ning’s poor performance has more to do with its own strategic missteps rather than an overall slowdown of the Chinese market,” said Mr Rein, noting that the brand had “more serious inventory problems” than others in the crowded sector.
318;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-01-24T23:38:58Z;Education: Obstacles still block path to girls’ schooling;When there are choices to be made in poor families, it is usually females who suffer, reports Sarah Murray;Pictures of Malala Yousafzai leaving hospital this month served as a reminder of both the threats to girls’ education from extremists and the courage of activists such as Ms Yousafzai, the young Pakistani shot last year by Taliban militants.However, extremist views are just one of a complex web of barriers that prevent girls from getting an education. Some obstacles are easier to fix than others. These include practical issues, such as the distance from home to school and the vulnerability of girls.John McLaverty, an education campaigner for Oxfam, remembers meeting a young girl in Sierra Leone who had to walk almost four hours to and from her village to school every day, which meant setting off before dawn and arriving home after dark.“That’s a major barrier,” says Mr McLaverty. “And the solution is to have schools closer to where people live and to provide some transport, such as bicycles.”Some barriers are less obvious. Lack of toilets and sanitation affects girls more than boys, particularly as girls reach puberty, with menstruation often forcing them to miss a week’s schooling each month.When Water Aid, a non-governmental organisation, studied groups of girls from schools in Nepal it found the main reason they were absent during menstruation was lack of waste disposal facilities, lack of privacy and water shortages.“There are these factors that we don’t always think of,” says Shalini Nataraj, director of advocacy and partnerships at the Global Fund for Women, which makes grants that support and strengthen women’s rights groups.Ms Nataraj stresses the need to gain intimate knowledge of families and communities in order to identify and remove such obstacles to girls’ education, particularly when it comes to culturally sensitive issues.“Some of our grantees make sanitary napkins available to girls,” she says. “But to do that, you have to work at the community level and know the context and chip away at all the barriers that are keeping them from gaining an education.”Poverty, of course, is at the root of many of the barriers to girls’ education. But when lack of funds forces families to make choices about their children’s education, cultural views of the role of girls and women in society shape the decision, argues Nora Fyles, senior education adviser at the United Nations Children’s Fund and head of the UN Girls’ Education Initiative. She cites the hypothetical example of a poor family with one boy, two girls and two chickens. When it comes to schooling, and the family must sell one of the chickens to buy a school uniform, the boy is invariably chosen.“Among all the barriers – distance from school, burden of chores, unsafe environments, lack of latrines – at the end, when there’s a decision to be made, the girl is disadvantaged,” says Ms Fyles.And while progress has been made in getting more girls into school, experts stress the need to keep them there. In the developing world, except China, one in seven girls will be married before the age of 15, while half of all first births are to adolescent girls, according to the Nike Foundation, funded by the sportswear group, whose Girl Effect initiative invests in girls as a poverty reduction strategy.“We know that as girls remain in school, the rate of return on the investment can be as high as 15 per cent,” says Ms Fyles. “But when they come out of school as young adults for marriage we lose that.”When girls remain in school the broader benefits are significant. Studies show, for example, that the longer girls spend at school, the less likely it is they will contract HIV, malaria and other diseases. And it has long been recognised that funding girls’ education has a high social and developmental return, giving more women access to labour markets and boosting their eventual wages.It was for this reason that the Nike Foundation launched its Girl Effect initiative. “In 2004, when we were looking at ways to end intergenerational poverty, the investment with the highest rate of return was adolescent girls,” explains Howard Taylor, the foundation’s managing director.Mr Taylor argues that it is important to reposition girls in society by educating those taking decisions about the resources allocated to girls, whether policy makers, community and religious leaders or parents.However, attention also needs to be paid to the quality of education being delivered, including teacher training and textbooks. “There’s been success in expanding the numbers,” says Mr Taylor. “But if you don’t then have a quality education that leads to life changes for girls, then quite quickly that cycle breaks.”For Ms Nataraj, investing in this way is money well spent. “Getting girls to school and keeping them there pays off in the long run in trillions of dollars saved or added to economies,” she says.
319;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-01-14T22:25:07Z;Nike signs deal with golfer McIlroy;;Golfer Rory McIlroy has put pen to paper on his multimillion-dollar deal with Nike, establishing the world number one as one of the hottest properties in sport.The 23-year-old from Northern Ireland joined rival Tiger Woods on Nike’s roster of athletes, and will wear the swoosh insignia for the first time at this week’s Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.Terms were not disclosed, though it has been widely reported that the deal could be worth over £150m to the player over the next 10 years. He will use Nike clubs, balls, clothing and accessories.Nike showed it intended to make the most of golf’s two biggest names, unveiling a TV commercial featuring them trying to outsmart each other with their golfing prowess.At a ceremony in the United Arab Emirates on Monday to announce the deal, the company showed videos of Mr Woods and fellow Nike athletes Roger Federer and Wayne Rooney welcoming the two-time major championship winner to the Nike roster.Mr McIlroy’s deal takes him into an earnings category that in Europe includes footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi and motor racing drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso.But he said: “I don't play golf for the money, I am well past that. I'm a major champion and world number one, which I have always dreamt of being, and feel this is a company that can help me sustain that and win even more major titles. At the end of 2013, if I have not won another major I will be disappointed.”His clean-cut image and youth will help Nike sell golf apparel, and is a welcome addition for the company that ended its sponsorship of Lance Armstrong last year following doping allegations levelled at the seven times Tour de France winner.But Nigel Currie of sports marketing consultants Brand Rapport said the golfer’s prime asset was his ability. “It is not that he is ‘safe’, but that he is likely to be the best golfer in the world for the next few years,” said Mr Currie.“The key thing is he is recognised around the world. McIlroy has the same potential to achieve what Woods has done.”Pat Finn, general secretary of the Golfing Union of Ireland, said Mr McIlroy was dominant in golf and had a great opportunity to become one of the best golfers in history.“I think Rory is one of the main reasons junior golf in Ireland is still going strong and membership is stable despite a decline in overall membership in Ireland. He brings people into the game all over the world,” he said.The all-Ireland body played a role in nurturing his talent when he played in various under-age Irish squads as an amateur.“Rory started playing golf when he was about two years of age and became involved with the Golfing Union of Ireland at the national level from the age of 12 or 13 years,” said Mr Finn.“He has made a massive contribution to our teams when he was involved and continues to help as a professional, for example spending time with our underage panels.”
320;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Indonesia: Nike in low wages row;;"The battle over factory pay in Indonesia is intensifying, with vocal local trade unions joining hands with a US non-governmental organisation to pressure Nike suppliers into paying minimum wages.A yawning gap is opening up between employers, who argue that hefty minimum wage increases are destroying their profitability, and trade unions, who argue that wages must rise further and employment conditions be improved.The Jakarta city government hiked the minimum wage by 44 per cent to Rp2.2m ($228) on January 1 and other provinces have followed suit with hefty increases.At a joint press conference in Jakarta on Monday, Indonesian trade unionists and Education for Justice, an American Catholic NGO, criticised Nike’s suppliers in Indonesia for seeking exemptions to the minimum wage, which are allowed for companies that cannot afford to raise pay.Jim Keady, who has run a long campaign for Education for Justice to pressure Nike to lift wages, said that only one of the seven or eight Nike suppliers he investigated in Indonesia had agreed to pay the new minimum wage.Although the minimum wage exemptions are legal, Keady and the trade unionists said that it was wrong for Nike suppliers to apply for them because even minimum wages were insufficient to cover the costs of a decent life.Indonesia is Nike’s third biggest source-country for shoes, after Vietnam and China, with 40 factories and 171,000 workers, 79 per cent of them women.Keady cited the example of a Nike supplier in Sukabumi, 80km south of Jakarta, which had won an exemption from the new provincial minimum wage, which was raised from Rp885,000 to Rp1.2m. The supplier won local government approval to pay Rp1.1m, which trade unionists say is barely enough to live on.The campaigners also accused Nike suppliers of intimidating workers to accept the wages below the legal minimum.The US company, which states in its code of conduct that it expects all contract factory workers to be paid “paid at least the minimum wage required by country law,” said it “takes these claims seriously” and is investigating them.It confirmed that some contractors were discussing the minimum wage levels with local governments and said that it expects such conversations “to take place within the provisions of the legal framework in Indonesia.”Indonesia’s powerful employers organisation, Apindo, has warned that some foreign factories are preparing to leave Indonesia and many others will be deterred from investing unless the government and companies stand up to unions and resist pressure for higher wages and better employment conditions.But Said Iqbal, the fiery head of Indonesia’s trade union confederation, summed up the defiant feeling among many low-paid workers who feel they have not benefited much from the country’s impressive economic growth record.“We need investment but we don’t need investors that don’t follow the law,” he said. “We want change and if the government and employers don’t listen, we will push for a national strike.”Related reading:

321;NKE;Nike Inc;2013-01-08T15:00:34Z;McIlroy tees up Nike sponsorship deal;;Golf’s world number one Rory McIlroy cleared the decks for his expected multimillion-dollar deal with Nike by announcing the end of his five-year relationship with Jumeirah, the luxury hotel group.The Ulsterman launched his professional career at the age of 18 with the support of the Dubai-based group.In a statement issued by Jumeirah, the player said: “Jumeirah became my first corporate sponsor when I turned professional back in 2007 and I would like to thank everyone at the company for their support in helping me become the player I am today.“I have enjoyed five very exciting and successful years with Jumeirah and will always have great memories of my time with the company.”Nike is lining up an announcement, expected next week, that the hottest talent in golf is signing an exclusive deal to promote its golf merchandise, including clubs and clothing.The 23-year-old began shifting his sponsorship strategy in October 2011 by parting company with agent Andrew “Chubby” Chandler of ISM. Twelve months later, he decided to end his relationship with Titleist, which supplied his clubs.The Nike deal is thought to be worth in the region of $20m a year for the player and the contract may last 10 years.Nike will hope to exploit the world number one’s clean-cut image and engaging personality. His relationship with Danish tennis star and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki also generates frequent media interest.The sportswear group stuck with its long-term sponsorship of Tiger Woods through the American golfer’s very public marriage breakdown and sexual proclivities.But it ended its 16-year relationship with ex-cyclist Lance Armstrong last year after his role in doping was exposed by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Jumeirah gained brand exposure principally from having its name on McIlroy’s golf cap. The deal was renewed in 2010 for three years.McIlroy filmed a promotional video for Jumeirah last year, playing a shot on the helipad of the group’s Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai. The winner of two major championships ended 2012 with victory in the World Tour Championship in Dubai and topped the US and European tour money lists.Gerald Lawless, Jumeirah’s president and chief executive, said of McIlroy: “He has been a tremendous ambassador for our brand both as a consummate golfing professional and as a young man with a great future ahead of him. We wish him continued success and we will continue to share a passion for his achievements and to welcome him in each of our hotels.”
322;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-12-20T23:03:23Z;Nike profits up despite falling China orders;;Nike, the US sportswear group, reported a second consecutive quarter of falling new orders in China, but its better-than-expected profits around the world cheered investors.In its greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, Nike said on Thursday that new orders – a key measure of its future revenues– were down 7 per cent from a year ago following a 6 per cent decline in the previous quarter.Despite its difficulties in China, Nike made a net profit of $521m, or $1.16 per share, in the three months to the end of November, excluding losses linked to its sales of the Umbro and Cole Haan businesses.Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1. The rise in profits triggered a 5.6 per cent jump in Nike shares to $104.50 in after-hours trading once the results were released.The Oregon-based group’s revenues for the quarter rose 7 per cent to $6bn, in line with Wall Street forecasts.In China, Nike said three months ago that it would work to “reset” the market as it dealt with the consequences of excess inventory, slowing economic growth and consumers rejecting some of its products.Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, said on Thursday that the group was seeing “encouraging signs” from its response, which includes making clothes better matched to people’s tastes and improving its distribution and retail systems.“Although there is still a lot work to be done, we’ve made solid progress in making China a healthier market in the short-term and a stronger market in the longer-term,” Mr Denson said.In spite of higher profits, Nike’s gross margin declined by 0.3 percentage points to 42.5 per cent as higher labour costs and negative currency effects outweighed the benefits of higher sale prices for its products and lower raw material costs.New orders, due for delivery by April 2013, were flat in western Europe, excluding currency effects, but rose in all Nike’s other markets, adding up to a worldwide increase of 7 per cent following an 8 per cent rise in the previous quarter.In November Nike completed the sale of some Umbro assets to the Iconix Brand group for $225m. In the same month it said it had reached an agreement to sell Cole Haan to Apax Partners for $570m, a deal it expects to complete next year.Nike’s share price has climbed by just under 3 per cent so far this year while the S&P 500 has risen by nearly 15 per cent.
323;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-12-20T18:03:22Z;Adidas soaks up punches to bring success;Shareholders should thank their super-confident chief, writes Tony Barber;Here, in no particular order, are six ingredients of success in top-level sport – natural talent, hard work, luck, inferior rivals, ambition and confidence. Add favourable macroeconomic conditions and intimate knowledge of the business and its customers, and you have a formula for successful chief executives of sporting goods companies too.Herbert Hainer, chief executive of Adidas, strikes me as a wonderful, almost Muhammad Ali-like example of the confidence required to succeed in the business of sport. Last month he was absorbing punches on the ropes as he informed investors that Adidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear group by sales after Nike, had lowered its 2012 sales forecast. Then he skipped back into the centre of the ring and delivered a well-timed blow: “We will see record sales and earnings in 2013 …All that I hear from the markets is that we are winning market share in each and every country.”Adidas shareholders should thank the super-confident Mr Hainer for guiding the company skilfully through a year that threw up more than its fair share of unusual challenges. Adidas is set to finish 2012 with a stock price up more than 40 per cent from its level 12 months ago. This compares with a 33 per cent rise in Germany’s blue-chip Dax-30 index, of which Adidas is a member, and – more pertinently – a meagre 2.5 per cent increase for Puma, Germany’s other leading sportswear group.It helped, of course, to be a big sports goods company in a big sports year, what with the London Olympics and the European football championship finals. Still, Adidas’s success did not come easy. Mr Hainer began the year knowing that Nike would take over as the official kit supplier for the NFL American football league, a lucrative contract held since 2001 by Reebok, an Adidas subsidiary.Matters at Reebok went from disappointing to ugly when a forensic audit uncovered extensive fraud at Reebok’s Indian unit, whose former managing director and chief operating officer were arrested. A third blow came in September when a financial quarrel erupted between the National Hockey League, the association that runs professional ice hockey in North America, and the players, who all wear Reebok gear. Not one game has been played all season, and the three-month dispute is eating into the €100m in annual revenues that Adidas gets from Reebok’s NHL-related sales.Adidas has therefore slashed its 2015 sales target for Reebok by a startling one-third to €2bn. This is a brave step. In 2005 Adidas trumpeted its $3.8bn acquisition of Reebok as the deal that would park its tanks on Nike’s lawn in the North American market and enable it to take aim at the US group’s global domination. Nike still holds the top position, but for Mr Hainer there is better news: investors are keeping Adidas’s share price high in spite of the troubles at Reebok.One explanation is Mr Hainer’s irresistibly infectious confidence about Adidas’s future. A second is that he has a shrewd instinct about where the sports goods business must go next to expand its appeal to customers. In an age of increasing life expectancy, this industry can tap into the desire of older people to jog, walk, go to the gym and play golf. At the other end of the age spectrum, Mr Hainer points out, sport and fitness can help address obesity among young people.These are not the only longer-term trends that work in Adidas’s favour. There is also the Chinese market to consider. In contrast to steel, textiles and other western industries, the Chinese sports goods sector has never threatened the supremacy of Nike and Adidas.The US and German giants are much better than China’s Anta Sports and Li-Ning at securing contracts with star athletes and developing brand loyalty among sports fans. As Adidas noted confidently in its guidance to investors last month, “local players [in China] struggle with declining brand image as well as inventory and product ageing issues”.But if Adidas can do it, why can’t Puma, which is based in the same German town of Herzogenaurach and which was born out of the same pre-second world war shoe business? In a nutshell, Puma, owned by PPR, the Paris-based luxury goods company, has too many product lines and too fuzzy an idea of itself as a premium sports fashion and lifestyle brand.Moreover, a recent clear-out of top executives at Puma contrasts starkly with the long-term boardroom stability at Adidas. Mr Hainer can sip his Christmas Sekt with confidence.Tony Barber is the Financial Times’ Europe Editor
324;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-12-20T17:47:00Z;Europe’s buyout groups turn to the US;;For Europe’s largest private equity houses, the US market has been a blessing, as the old continent grapples with recession and the sovereign debt crisis restricts the amount of debt financing for buyouts.CVC Capital, Apax, BC Partners and Permira, which built operations in the US over the last decade, have been more active in North America than in their home region this year. They are finding sellers have more reasonable price expectations and financing is easier to raise.“In Europe, it has been almost a binary outcome: the companies that transact are sold at high prices and the others don’t get sold,” said John Coyle, head of Permira’s New York office. “There’s no doubt it’s easier to get financing in the US and at more attractive terms.”There have been €109.3bn worth of US buyouts, accounting for 45.3 per cent of global buyouts, according to Mergermarket. While this is down 5 per cent from last year, 2011 and 2012 have produced the two highest volumes since 2007, the peak of the market, and they compare with a 21.3 per cent drop in Europe.Permira, co-headed by Kurt Björklund and New York-based Tom Lister, has announced three investments in the US out of four this year, including the $1.6bn buyout of genealogy website Ancestry.com in October and the $1.5bn acquisition of Genesys, Alcatel-Lucent’s call-centre services business.North America has accounted for half of Apax’s deals over the past two years, from 40 per cent historically. Europe, which used to make up the majority, has dropped to 20 per cent, while the proportion of emerging market deals has tripled.This year, Apax, with a team of 36 investment professionals in the US, bought New York-based shoe designer and retailer Cole Haan for $570m from Nike and Canada-based security and cash logistics company Garda for C$1.1bn. It has not announced an acquisition in Europe since buying mobile phone operator Orange Switzerland from France Telecom in December last year.BC’s two largest investments were originated in the US this year. In July, the London group, jointly with Carlyle, agreed to buy Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial from United Technologies, in a deal valuing the assets at $3.46bn. The same month, it led the $6.6bn purchase of cable company Suddenlink, the world’s second-largest buyout this year, according to Mergermarket.The US is also where European groups have found buyers for their assets. Permira offloaded its stake in NDS to Cisco Systems in a deal valuing the set-top box maker at about $5bn. CVC sold eastern European brewer StarBev to Denver-based Molson Coors for €2.65bn in April. The group, headed by Christopher Stadler in the US, bought restructuring group AlixPartners for about $1.1bn and claims management company Cunningham Lindsey, also for about $1bn. CVC’s only buyout in Europe has been the €1.8bn purchase of Ahlsell.Mr Stadler, however, warned that the US market may suffer from uncertainties caused by the fiscal cliff. “I am a bit concerned about the start of the year – we’re observing some weakness,” he said. “Some companies are waiting on large investment or sale decisions until the fiscal situation is resolved.”

Talks between Republican and Democratic leaders soured on Thursday, adding to pessimism among investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher for the week to 13,025.58. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 3,010.24.Meanwhile, US corporates continued to issue a record number of special dividends to escape higher taxes on equity income payments.Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, said: “Investors are rewarding tax-prudent action by US corporates, which are using their coffers to issue special dividends ahead of the tax rises next year.” Dividend taxes, which stand at 15 per cent, could rise to more than 40 per cent unless politicians can avoid the fiscal cliff.Costco, which runs warehouse-style discount stores, said on Wednesday it would pay out a special $7 dividend in December. Shares in the company rose 6.42 per cent to $103.99 for the week. Dillards, the department store retailer, said earlier in the week it would issue a one-time cash dividend of $5 a share. Its shares notched up a 2.9 per cent gain to $88.91 for the week.However, Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain, was an exception among stocks that issued special dividends this week. The company’s shares fell 1.8 per cent to $93.36 as it said it would pay a $2 special dividend before the end of the year.A week after holiday shopping season began, retailers remained among the most-discussed stocks as data showed the effects of superstorm Sandy, which battered the US northeast seaboard last month, affected businesses. Economic data published this week showed US consumer spending declined in October. US department store data showed falling sales for the month of November despite a post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.The reports limited gains for consumer discretionary sector stocks and companies on the S&P 500 retailing index, which rose 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent for the week.Macy’s, the department store chain, extended its decline from Thursday when it reported its first monthly fall in same-store sales in three years. The company’s shares fell 7.3 per cent for the week to $38.70. Kohl’s, the department store retailer, dropped 14.6 per cent to $44.65.Shares in Groupon, the daily deals group, saw heavy losses on Friday after the troubled company’s chief executive Andrew Mason survived a board meeting at which his leadership role was said to be at stake. Still, the company recorded a 5 per cent gain for the week to $4.19. Since its public float last year at $20 a share, Groupon has shed 79 per cent.Yum Brands, which runs Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other fast food restaurant chains, fell 9.4 per cent to $67.08.Shares in Netflix, the internet streaming and home DVD delivery company, fell 1.5 per cent to $81.71 as a competitor emerged for the company’s Mexico business. América Móvil, the company run by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said it would launch a Netflix-style service known as Clarovideo at a cheaper monthly price for consumers.Knight Capital Group, the electronic trading and market-making company, rose 35.3 per cent to $3.37 as it received takeover offers from two competitors this week.
327;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-17T03:06:41Z;Games take on another dimension;Some of today’s most memorable pop-culture icons have come from video games, like Pac-Man and Mario;"Design pitch for a memor­able character: a yellow circle, with a triangular wedge removed to indicate a mouth, that roams around a maze eating white dots and being chased by ghosts. Or a blue, bipedal hedgehog who wears red trainers and runs at supersonic speeds through deserts, space stations and underwater temples. Or how about a fat, mustachioed Italian plumber who wears blue dungarees and chases mushrooms?They may not sound like designs that would last decades, but Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario are some of the most recognisable video game icons of today, known to gamers and non-gamers alike. These are visual images that are, in their own way, on a par with Warhol’s Marilyn, the Coca-Cola logo or the Nike swoosh. The design of games may even reach more people than any of these – there are hundreds of millions of people worldwide who, between them, spend billions of hours gaming each year.This desire to take refuge in alternative virtual worlds has led to an outburst of new design thinking. Some of the most familiar images hail from a period in the 1980s when games were almost exclusively designed in 2D, and where realism wasn’t the idea, because realism, graphically speaking, was impossible to achieve.Then came the birth of the 3D era in the mid-1990s. Suddenly designers had a whole new dimension to explore and present on screen, and in games such as Tomb Raider and Resident Evil the new goal became graphical realism. Dreamlike concepts were replaced with attempts to refine and replicate the real world – even if you were shooting zombies, the undead and their environment had to look genuine. And these games were impressive to look at, certainly. They were feats of engineering and programming, undoubtedly. But although there was the potential for new ways to explore the interactive visual arena, imagination was sacrificed in the name of increasingly complex in-game 3D physics and the chance to make games look more like movies.This hasn’t been the case for all “art design” in games, however. In recent years, designers – particularly indie designers – have been harking back to the more daring 2D age. This year saw the release on Xbox of Fez, a puzzle game in which the art design is as much an homage to the 8-bit platform era of the late 1980s as it is a parody of the changes in games brought about by 3D. It looks like the kind of otherworldly 2D design that existed 25 years ago – big, chunky sprites that make up free-floating platforming environments.The twist comes in the ability to rotate the 2D plane around a 3D axis. With the squeeze of a button, the flat 2D front of a building rotates so that you’re standing against the side of the edifice. Another squeeze and it rotates round to the back, and so on. It’s a neat visual trick, and a wonderful play on the differences between the two visual types. But the design goes deeper than being a gimmick: Fez is, at its heart, a puzzle game, and elements of the art design, such as the familiar shapes of Tetris-type blocks littered throughout, are incorporated into solving the puzzles and finishing the game. They help to tell the story and expand the gaming experience while managing to look both familiar and distinct.Another indie game that has used art in a 2D design to enhance the game environment is Braid (2008). Its world is beautiful to look at – lush brushstrokes make up the background, while the foreground consists of intricate, interactive details. But according to Braid’s designer Jonathan Blow, he had already deve­loped most of the gameplay mechanics before the art design was brought in. “You could divide development into two halves,” Blow says. “The basic gameplay development half and the visual half. The visuals came later, in that the game was completely play­able before that.”Blow worked with web comic artist David Hellman to arrive at a design that would best convey the ideas of the game. The aim was to use atmosphere and mood to tell a story of pursuit and discovery at any cost with almost no dialogue. “I talked to [Hellman] about what this world is about thematically; here’s what we want it to feel like emotionally and here’s the progression,” says Blow. “There are progressions that aren’t explicitly stated, but there are things that happen between the moods of the levels and what they look like as you go from the first level to the last.”There were advantages and challenges to developing Braid in this way, according to Blow, who had “basically no art experience” coming into the game. For instance, when he was designing the core time, puzzle and platform mechanics, he didn’t have to worry about “this thing that happens with a lot of games where the art obscures the puzzles or makes them more confusing. When your world is made out of blocks, it’s clear that a gap can’t be jumped. But once you start putting grass on there and little graphics that go out farther than where you can stand, and then you put some stuff in the background, then it can easily become confusing and less crisp.” In the end, the art design went through many iterations before Blow was happy with both Braid’s look and gameplay.There was never any question for Blow of doing Braid in 3D – it just wouldn’t work. “Impressionistic stuff is much harder to do in 3D,” says Blow. The same is true of Limbo (2010), a game whose entire look is based on black-and-white shadows and silhouettes that would have been impossible to render in 3D.That’s not to say that the world of mainstream 3D games has been entirely dead to the idea of innovative art design. There are the sci-fi worlds and technology of the Halo series (2001-present); the Ayn Rand-inspired, art deco dystopia of Bioshock (2007); and the period detail of the Assassin’s Creed games (2007-present), which have put players in 12th-century Jerusalem, Renaissance Italy and, most recently, the American war of independence. But they all rely on realism as their starting point.Dishonored, which came out this year, exemplifies this, with its creation of an alt-Victorian, steampunk look. It is set in the fictional city of Dunwall, which was based on architectural details from London and Edinburgh – recognisably so in some cases. Art director Sebastien Mitton and visual design director Viktor Antonov approached the city design “as architectural historians initially. They talked about which cultures had what building materials, how long the structures lasted, who invaded, what new architectural styles rose up, and how the people living there use the space,” according to co-creative directors Raphael Colantonio and Harvey Smith. At the same time as these realistic elements were brought in, Mitton worked on creating “non-photorealistic proportions for characters, the lighting, palette and texturing style”, to create contrast and a unique visual aesthetic.In the modern gaming era, there will always be a battle between interesting art design and the other considerations that go into making a game. But the bolder the art design, the more players will feel they have escaped reality and visited another place. For Blow, “There’s a message in the visuals, and the effort that’s been put into the graphics. It’s a subliminal thing, a message which says that somebody really cared about putting this experience together …it says you’re in good hands.”"
328;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-16T23:55:06Z;$600m Snoopy bonds anything but Peanuts;;Snoopy just got sliced, diced and served to bond investors.Iconix Brand Group, which owns the rights to the Peanuts cartoon strip featuring Snoopy, Charlie Brown and their friends, sold $600m of bonds backed by the revenues from its portfolio of brands.The unusual deal is the latest in a line of esoteric securitisations, in which investors have been offered bonds backed by everything from timeshare loans to racehorse semen. With interest rates at historic lows, investors have sought the higher yields available on these unusual securities.Iconix had planned to raise $500m but said on Friday it had increased the size of the deal due to strong demand.The company will use the proceeds to pay for its acquisition of Umbro. It agreed last month to buy the sports apparel and footwear brand from Nike for $225m in cash.Umbro joins a portfolio of 28 Iconix brands, including Mossimo, London Fog, Candie’s, Mudd, Sharper Image and partial rights to Madonna’s Material Girl.Iconix said this month that the brands together represent more than $13bn in annual retail sales. The $600m of securitised notes are backed by licensing income from 23 of the brands.Neil Cole, chief executive, said at the company’s latest quarterly results that the launch of a new Peanuts film and international expansion would boost growth. After paying for the Umbro deal, the remaining proceeds from the securitisation will be used to pay down existing debt and kept for future acquisitions. Barclays led the Iconix securitisation, with co-managers Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Guggenheim.The market for so-called esoteric asset-backed securities (ABS) has revived this year, along with the wider market for ABS, which are more traditionally backed by home equity, credit card and car loans, sometimes called “prime” ABS.Daniel McGarvey, head of asset-backed finance at RBS, said some companies might find it easier or cheaper to raise debt through the securitisation of assets rather than issuing bonds in the high-yield bond market, and investor demand for esoteric ABS showed no sign of abating.“The driver is investors are finding opportunities for yield in this market that the flow of prime ABS is not giving them. ABS backed by auto loans, credit cards and student loans have been well bid already.”Cory Wishengrad, co-head of the US ABS business at Barclays, echoed the sentiment. He said: “Given the overall yield environment and given how much spreads have tightened in more on-the-run securities, investors are increasingly looking for places where they’re comfortable on credit but where they can also generate yield.”
329;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-16T22:17:38Z;Wall Street falls for second week;;Wall Street suffered a second week of heavy losses following the US election as continued uncertainty over a resolution of the fiscal cliff weighed on investors.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,359.88 on the week, adding to declines from last Tuesday when President Barack Obama and a divided Congress were re-elected.US equities have fallen 4.8 per cent since the vote as Wall Street fears that political gridlock could send the US economy into recession as the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes nears. Friday’s session was marked by a modest rally as President Obama and congressional leaders began their negotiations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.7 per cent to 12,588.31 for the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,853.13.“The market will not accept the fiscal cliff going into the New Year without some compromise,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.Investors offered mixed views on the immediate impact for stocks.“We’re telling people to buy this dip,” said David Bianco, chief equity strategist for Deutsche Bank. “We simply don’t think whatever new legislation comes into being will have as severe an impact on the economy that it would trigger a recession.”Others, however, said the likelihood of a near-term rally for stocks was limited.“The stock market is likely to remain under pressure until a deal [to avert the fiscal cliff] is done,” said John Higgins at Capital Economics.“And while any successful compromise could provide some relief, we would not expect any rally to last given the ongoing sluggishness of the domestic economy and a probable re-escalation of the crisis in the euro-zone soon.”Meanwhile, the information technology sector was among the worst performing industry groups on the week, despite a positive earnings report from Cisco, a bellwether for the sector.The network equipment maker outperformed the index, which fell 2.2 per cent, as it hailed a recovery in US demand for its products. The company’s shares rose 7 per cent to $17.99 for the week.But that positive momentum was short-lived as Dell reported poor results on Friday. The computer maker’s troubles were highlighted as it said Asian rivals picked up market share in the PC business, while the segment contracted due to shifting consumer preferences. Dell shares, which have fallen 39.6 per cent from the start of the year, dropped 6.1 per cent to $8.84 on the week.The sector’s most important stock, Apple, also continued to decline as the iPhone and iPad maker dropped 3.5 per cent to $527.72 on the week. Analysts tried to assess the reason for the sharp decline in the company’s stock, which has fallen more than a quarter since reaching its all-time high in September.“We seem to be in the midst of one of the most controversial periods in Apple’s stock in the past 10 years with what appears to be a sudden wave of pessimism overtaking the largest and most owned stock in the world,” said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Barclays.Mr Reitzes, who maintained his price target of $800 for Apple shares, said increased competition for smartphone makers such as Samsung had fed a perception that iPhone sales were likely to slow.Another possible explanation, he said, was that investors may be repositioning their portfolios and cashing in on large gains from owning Apple ahead of expected increases in capital gains and dividend taxes next year. Shares in the company have risen 30.3 per cent so far this year.Nike shares gained 0.3 per cent to $92.59 as the footwear and apparel company said it would sell shoe and bag brand Cole Haan to private equity firm Apax Partners for $570m.McDonalds replaced the head of its US business on Thursday, a week after the company reported its first monthly sales decline in nine years. Shares in the company were down 0.7 per cent to $84.12 for the week.Hertz shares gained 1.4 per cent to $14.54 as the Federal Trade Commission approved its $2.3bn takeover bid for rival car rental company Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group. Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 4.2 per cent to $87.49.A glitch that prevented trading in more than 200 stocks for most of Monday on the Big Board created the latest headache for NYSE Euronext.. The exchange operator fell 1.7 per cent to $22.55 as it suffered the latest high-profile setback in the securities industry.Jefferies, the mid-sized US investment bank, rose 10.4 per cent to $15.75 as it was purchased by Leucadia National, the investment conglomerate, in a deal that valued it at $3.6bn. Leucadia shares lost 6.1 per cent to $20.48 for the week.Starbucks shares declined 4.3 per cent to $48.76 over the week as it purchased tea operator Teavana for $620m.
330;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Armstrong resigns from Livestrong charity;;Disgraced professional cyclist Lance Armstrong cut ties with Livestrong, his cancer charity, after he was accused of cheating during his nearly 20-year career.Mr Armstrong had stepped down as chairman of the charity’s board in October shortly before cycling’s ruling body stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles for using banned substances and blood doping. The Union Cycliste Internationale also banned him from the sport for life.“Lance Armstrong has chosen to voluntarily resign from the board of directors of the Livestrong Foundation to spare the organisation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding his cycling career,” said Jeff Garvey, the organisation’s chairman, in a statement.The charity, which has raised more than $500m in the last 10 years, had stood by Mr Armstrong throughout the lengthy investigation, which culminated in a damning report by the US anti-doping agency and the verdict by the UCI.“Our longstanding concerns about the impartiality and fairness of USADA’s proceeding are compounded today. As a federal judge pointed out, USADA appears motivated more by publicity rather than fulfilling its mission,” Mr Garvey said in October.The USADA report alleged that Mr Armstrong and a close circle of compatriots ran an organised doping ring and had engaged in “serial cheating” while on the US Postal Service cycling team. The report included testimony from more than a dozen former teammates, financial records and blood tests.Mr Armstrong brought cycling to prominence in the US and his association with Nike and Trek helped to increase the market for cycling gear and bicycles. He also became the face of Livestrong, including appearing in Nike commercials asserting his innocence.Mr Armstrong could not be reached for comment on Monday, but has vehemently denied the allegations in the past and objected to the USADA and UCI rulings.Mr Armstrong personally donated nearly $7m to the charity, which is known for its bright yellow plastic wristbands and association with many brands.Nike, RadioShack and Trek are some of Livestrong’s largest corporate partners and came to the charity through their association with Mr Armstrong. Those three and others have cut ties as personal sponsors, costing Mr Armstrong a reported $15m a year.He is also facing potential legal battles with the UCI over prize money.Mr Armstrong founded Livestrong in 2003 as part of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which raises cancer awareness and promotes advocacy for cancer patients. Mr Armstrong survived a bout of testicular cancer early in his career and has been a public face for advocacy, including sitting on former President George W. Bush’s cancer panel.
331;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-12T00:01:32Z;Skilful players can get ahead of the game;Using game design thinking as a teaching tool is growing in popularity;For years it was a secret, but Leslie Tullis – a formerly closeted video-game geek – says she can now speak openly about her obsession. She grew up on Nintendo and Super Nintendo. In college she played World of Warcraft. She’s been a SimCity fan for nearly 20 years and is an expert at Portal and Civilization.“Games are tremendously motivating,” she says. “Your performance means something. And you’re having fun.”As an MBA student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, she was drawn to a new course on gamification – about the application of video-game elements to engage customers and employees.“The course was about taking stuff from video games and saying, ‘this works on gamer geeks but it also works in other environments, too’,” says Ms Tullis, a former investment banker who graduated last year and now works as a video-game strategist in the San Francisco Bay Area.The term gamification, which loosely refers to the use of game design techniques in non-game contexts, has been around for a few years. Recently, it has become a bona fide buzzword – labelled “the next big thing” – and a way for companies to exploit the popularity of video games and the ubiquity of mobile devices.Top business schools are now beginning to introduce classes on the subject, while others are “gamifying” aspects of their courses.“The term itself might be a fad but the underlying principles are going to endure,” according to Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies at Wharton. Prof Werbach teaches three separate classes on gamification, including a massive open online course (mooc) on Coursera, which drew 80,000 students from more than 150 countries.“Think about social media in the last five years or so. It was dismissed as a fad. But I think now pretty much every company today recognises that social media is an important mechanism for them to engage customers.”In 2008, researchers at the University of Washington launched a protein-folding online puzzle competition that harnessed the brainpower of video gamers to solve medical challenges.The game, Foldit, requires players to tinker with proteins and connect amino acids to identify their best possible “folded” states. Scientists evaluate the highest scoring “folds” to see if the solutions can be applied to real proteins. Essentially, the game crowd sources scientific discoveries to help find cures for diseases.Gamers have already made significant scientific contributions. Last year players helped reveal the configuration of an Aids-related enzyme – a problem that had stumped researchers for more than a decade. The discovery will help scientists develop drugs to fight HIV and Aids.“This is what counts as an epic win,” says Jane McGonigal, a game designer.Prof Werbach, author of For the Win, describes gamification as “approaching problems from the perspective of a game designer to tap into the psychology of motivation”.“It is not limited to a specific industry, business function or type of organisation and many companies are doing gamification without even realising it,” he says. His course teaches students how to apply gamification to business areas such as human resources, sustainability, innovation, customer engagement and marketing.“Marketing is an easy application for games. There is a straight line between customer engagement and enthusiasm to revenue generation.”The amount of money that companies spend on gamifying their products and services is projected to increase. According to M2 Research, the California-based technology research company, business spending on gamification will rise from an estimated $242m this year to $2.8bn in 2016.“In the future there’s going to be a lot more game elements in our lives – in user interface, business software, even in our cars,” says Karl Kapp, a gamification consultant.A well-designed game responds to something deep in the human psyche, says Jane McGonigal, who has developed large-scale games for organisations such as the World Bank, including a simulation about the challenges of a worldwide oil shortage. “Games are not easy. They’re about being challenged. They fulfil a psychological need and they give us the feeling of mastery and success.”NikeiD, a service provided by Nike, uses game mechanics that enable customers to design their own pair of shoes. They customise the material, colour, size and stitching – a process that transforms the act of buying new tennis shoes from a transaction to a creative experience. Sephora, the cosmetics chain, has created an online community where customers become “make-up experts” and are promoted within the group based on the quality and popularity of their advice.“What [companies and organisations should be trying to promote is the] social element and the shared experience that a video game provides,” says Ms McGonigal. “[Sephora] is not necessarily saving the world but it is giving people a feeling that they are an esteemed member of a community and they are needed.”Some schools are using gamification techniques in the classroom.Steven Johnson, an assistant professor of management information systems at Temple’s Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, uses video-game elements in his social media innovation course to motivate students. The course is portrayed as a “quest”, where students can earn points for different activities, such as commenting on a blog, and collect badges at particular levels. Each week Prof Johnson recognises those students who have climbed a level with school-branded memorabilia such as T-shirts.Other schools, including IE Business School and MIT Sloan School of Management, use video games in the form of management simulators to help students practise new concepts and ideas.Video games are a familiar learning tool for the “millennial generation”, a tech-savvy crop of students. “They are digital natives, says Jaime Castello Molina, a lecturer of marketing at Esade in Spain. “They are used to these kinds of tools and environments. But I also think it’s a better way to teach and a better way to work.”…Prof Molina has created a course about strategic sales management that features a video game. The game creates a virtual world where students face business dilemmas similar to those presented in case studies.As players, they gather information and determine, for example, the best way to maximise profitability, or which customer segment to target with a new product or offering. The game allows students to experiment with different decisions and shows them how their choices affect business outcomes in multiple ways.“We want to engage them and we want them to keep playing,” says Prof Molina. “They’re practising concepts, working with new tools and still having fun.”
332;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-08T14:39:33Z;Reebok sales fall hits Adidas earnings;;Adidas cut its sales forecast for this year because of lower expectations for its Reebok and Rockport brands but maintained it would reach its anticipated level of record earnings.The sports goods maker, number two by sales in the world behind Nike, endured a 25 per cent fall in Reebok sales in the third quarter, hit by the fallout from irregularities at the brand’s Indian unit as well as the end of an agreement to supply products for the US National Football League.Reebok is also being hit by a player lockout at the National Hockey League in the US, where it is an official supplier. Sales were being affected during the current quarter, one of the most important for the sport, Adidas said.The NHL dispute was one of several factors that Adidas said would hit fourth-quarter sales, including its “clean-up” in India and poor comparisons with a period when Olympics products started hitting shops last year.“This is a material headwind for our smallest quarter,” said Herbert Hainer, chief executive. “We expect to be able to offset most of these headwinds. Based on that, we have made some small adjustments to our full-year guidance.”Mr Hainer said revenues at Reebok, which it bought in 2005, would have been down 6 per cent without one-time effects. “While this is still by no means satisfactory, it is an improvement in trend compared with the second-quarter decline of 10 per cent,” he said.“We do see encouraging signs for the brand, particularly in markets led by [our] own retail and controlled space…comparable store sales globally are up 11 per cent in the third quarter.”Sales of the Adidas brand rose 10 per cent in the third quarter and were also up by double-digit amounts at the group’s golf brands including TaylorMade.Overall group sales this year would now rise at a “high single-digit rate”, said Adidas, slightly worse than previously estimated growth of almost 10 per cent. Third-quarter sales rose 4 per cent adjusted for currency effects, while net income attributable to shareholders rose 14 per cent to €344m.In the first nine months, net income was 22 per cent higher than last year and Adidas stuck to forecasts that annual net income would grow between 15 and 17 per cent, to at least €770m.Mr Hainer said he also expected “significant double-digit earnings growth” and better sales and operating margins next year.Adidas shares were down 1.3 per cent at €64.43 by early afternoon in Frankfurt.
333;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-05T23:49:01Z;Nike nears deal to sell Cole Haan;;Nike is nearing a deal to sell its lossmaking Cole Haan shoe and bag brand to private equity firm Apax Partners for about $500m, according to people familiar with the matter.A deal was not expected to be announced on Tuesday, when US voters go to the polls, but could come soon.Apax, based in London, has partnered with Jack Boys, former chief executive of Converse, who is expected to run the company after it is bought from Nike. Converse is also owned by Nike.Other private equity firms including TPG Capital and Berkshire Partners had been interested in the business. But Apax, which has significant experience in the retail sector, is expected to prevail. Apax and TPG declined to comment.Selling Cole Haan would complete a process that began in May for Nike, when the biggest shoemaker in the world said it would divest the brand, along with Umbro, the UK-based football line. Goldman Sachs was said to be advising Nike on the sale.The divestitures will allow Oregon-based Nike to focus on its core businesses, including its Jordan brand and athletic brands, the company said at the time.Last month Nike said it would sell Umbro to Iconix Brand Group, the second-largest licensing company in the world, for $225m. That price was significantly less than Nike paid for Umbro, when it took the company private for £285m ($455m) in 2008.In 2009, Nike wrote off $400m on Umbro’s declining goodwill, a move that allowed the company to achieve a lower effective tax rate for the year.Nike has owned Cole Haan for much longer, having bought the company for about $90m in 1988. During that time it has made the brand one of the best known American shoe names. But in recent years customers have begun to complain on shopping websites about its deteriorating quality.The company’s diminished reputation will pose a test for Apax, which will have to restore the brand to its previous lustre while also squeezing out a profit and finding new efficiencies.Cole Haan had revenues of $535m last fiscal year, a 3 per cent rise from the previous year, but lost $43m. It operates 190 stores worldwide, with a majority of them in the US, including a flagship location at New York City’s Rockefeller Center.Apax’s frontrunner status in the auction was first reported by Reuters.
334;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-11-05T00:23:16Z;Skins seeks damages over Armstrong scandal;;An Australian sports wear company is seeking US$2m in damages from cycling’s government body, claiming its brand has been damaged by the mismanagement of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal.Skins, which has backed cycling teams since 2008 and supplied the USA cycling team with race suits at the London Olympics, alleges Union Cycliste Internationale is responsible for a “total loss of confidence” in professional cycling that has harmed its brand.“Skins was under the illusion that professional cycling had been fundamentally reformed to contain doping and minimise the risk of scandals with which the brand of any sponsor could be associated,” the company said in a letter sent to UCI.Armstrong was banned for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after the US Anti-Doping Agency published a report claiming the US cyclist had used performance enhancing drugs.The move by Skins to seek damages raises the possibility that other sportswear companies might also launch action against UCI.Armstrong’s biggest sponsors have served ties with the former professional cyclist after the allegation emerged that he was at the centre of the “most sophisticated professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen”. Nike, Trek, RadioShack and AB InBev have all dropped sponsorship ties.Jaimie Fuller, Skins chairman, said an “overhaul” of cycling could only be achieved by a “credible and capable” governing body and called on UCI President Pat McQuaid and Honorary President for Life Hein Verbruggen to stand down.The UCI has set up an independent commission into itself and ordered Armstrong to return the prize money he received for his seven Tour de France titles. It is seeking to recover up to $3m.Mr McQuaid recently denied allegations that the governing body accepted a donation from Armstrong in return for overlooking a positive test.
335;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-25T21:16:19Z;Coe on marks for £12m image rights deal;;Lord Coe will benefit from a post-Olympic bounce when he sells the image rights to his future earnings in a deal that could be worth as much as £12m.The chairman of the London organising committee, Locog, is expected to accelerate the sale of his Complete Leisure Group to Chime Communications following a board meeting of the global PR consultancy on Friday.The deal would give Chime the rights to Lord Coe’s client, consulting and non-executive director fees, plus commissions, royalties and appearance income for the next 15 years.He will receive a “golden hello” of £1.9m in cash, followed by regular tranches of payments in cash and shares based on a multiple of five times CLG’s average earnings. The deal is capped at £12m.The structure of the deal was chosen because it was more tax-efficient for Lord Coe, according to people familiar with the deal.Chime will appoint Lord Coe as chairman of its sports marketing division on a salary of £350,000 a year until at least April 2017. A third of the salary is charged to CLG.He is also entitled to an annual bonus of £150,000 a year if profit targets are hit, plus pension and healthcare entitlements.Chime expects Lord Coe to introduce clients to its group, which is focused on sports marketing, advertising and healthcare, and wants the Olympic overlord to help it become a leading global sports marketing business.Chime will pay CLG up to 10 per cent of the income Lord Coe introduces to the group in the first year.The group last year bought a marketing company in Brazil, venue of the 2014 football world cup and the 2016 Olympics. It had contracts with more than a dozen London Olympic and Paralympic sponsors, though Locog said none of them were acquired through the organising committee.Lord Coe’s income is projected to be worth £1.5m in 2013, made up of £450,000 in ambassadorial and consulting contracts, £300,000 from his contract with Nike, after-dinner speeches worth £20,000 each and £250,000 in media work, according to people familiar with the terms. This annual income is expected to grow to £2.5m in 2015.Chime expects Lord Coe’s involvement to be worth at best £9.7m in profit to the group. Lord Coe’s adviser estimates his operating costs, including an assistant, property and travel, to be £300,000 next year, rising to £800,000 in 2016.The deal is likely to be completed once Lord Coe has paid £100,000 to buy out the 7 per cent of his company held by other shareholders, including the foreign secretary, William Hague. Lord Coe was Mr Hague’s chief of staff during his tenure as leader of the Conservative party.Under the terms of the deal, Lord Coe needs Chime’s approval to accept any other directorships. Chime is comfortable about him becoming chairman of the British Olympic Association – he is the only candidate for the vacancy.A spokeswoman for Lord Coe said: “As and when he has concrete plans about any part of his life, he will announce it then.”Chime, which this summer sold its Bell Pottinger PR agency to founders Lord Bell and Piers Pottinger for £19.6m, could not be reached for comment.
336;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-24T21:59:59Z;Nike sells Umbro brand to Iconix;;Iconix Brand Group has agreed to buy Nike’s Umbro sports apparel and footwear unit for $225m in cash, marking the fashion brand’s second deal with the US sportswear group.Nike announced in May it would divest its Umbro and Cole Haan businesses in an effort to focus on its core Nike brand and its fast-growing Jordan, Converse and Hurley business lines.The transaction will pass Umbro, the UK-based brand that supplies the England football team kit, to Iconix, the second-largest licensing company in the world, with $12bn in global retail sales.“It is a difficult decision to divest any business but this action will enable us to focus on our highest potential growth opportunities,” said Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike.“Umbro has a great heritage, but ultimately, as our category strategy has evolved, we believe Nike Football can serve the needs of footballers both on and off the pitch.”Nike took Umbro private in 2008 for £285m, as the Oregon-based company sought to increase its football revenues – which it said at the time had reached $1.5bn annually – and to compete better with German rival Adidas.But Nike failed to revive the 80-year-old football brand as it had done with Converse, and revenues fell to $224m last year from $276m in 2006. At the same time, the company’s Nike-branded football gear gained market share.“Umbro and Cole Haan were already unprofitable and excluded from Nike’s quarterly results so I don’t think it matters to the stock. They already have over $2bn of cash on hand so the $225m won’t have an impact,” said Andrew Burns, analyst at DA Davidson.“Nike had a choice to pursue growth in Umbro or in their own football category. The company will get a much better return on investment on their own brand, so they let Umbro go,” he added.Iconix, run by Neil Cole, brother of the designer Kenneth Cole, licenses brands to big box retailers such as Walmart and Target that manufacture and sell the merchandise.“Umbro is a true, authentic football brand with a global, loyal consumer fan base, and we are thrilled to be adding it to our portfolio of iconic brands,” said Neil Cole.The deal is expected to close by the end of 2012.Iconix, owner of Candie’s shoes and the Mossimo, Marc Ecko and Badgley Mischka clothing brands, previously bought Starter – the lower-end shoe line – from Nike in 2007.Nike shares closed up 7 cents in New York to $92.89, while Iconix gained 1.7 per cent to $18.76.
337;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
338;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-24T12:35:48Z;Puma weighs fresh cuts in fitness fight;;Puma is considering more short-term cost cuts in a fresh sign of the sports goods maker’s struggle for fitness amid the economic slowdown.In a period when its biggest contracted star – Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt– shone at the London Olympics, the German group’s third-quarter net income dropped 85 per cent after €80m of restructuring charges. Further cost-cutting measures could be put in place by the end of the year.The German group, owned by France’s PPR, is the third-largest sportswear maker by sales but its performance has recently lagged behind that of local rival Adidas, which announces earnings next month. Nike, the market leader, last month reported a slowdown in the big Chinese market and Puma on Wednesday also said sales were slowing in China, while quarterly sales in Europe fell.Franz Koch, chief executive for the past year-and-a-half, said Puma had been obliged to take “decisive actions to overcome the issues we are currently facing, in particular in Europe”.Volker Bosse, an analyst at Baader Bank, said Puma was suffering from a “weaker product perception versus its peers” but expected other retailers and consumer goods groups also to show slower sales and a “softer wording on the business outlook” in quarterly earnings.Puma had warned in July that earnings this year would be significantly lower than in 2011. Sales would still grow this year by a mid-single digit amount, Puma said.Mr Koch – whose predecessor, Jochen Zeitz, is to leave Puma’s supervisory board next month – hopes new products will reinvigorate growth next year. In the meantime Puma is slashing its range, eliminating 30 per cent of its products by the end of 2015. It will also close underperforming stores, cutting the network from 590 to 540 by the end of next year.Third-quarter sales growth of 6 per cent in euro terms was below analysts’ estimates while the Olympics also pushed up marketing outlay, contributing to a 9.5 per cent rise in quarterly operating costs.Underlying operating earnings were down 16 per cent to €98.8m, before charges related to restructuring. Those charges pushed net income down from €81.7m last year to €12.2m.The shares were up 1 per cent to €217.80 in afternoon Frankfurt trading.
339;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-22T22:24:50Z;Armstrong banned from cycling for life;;Cycling’s ruling body banned Lance Armstrong for life and stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles on Monday, but struggled to draw a line under a doping scandal that has brought its leadership of the sport into question.Pat McQuaid, president of Union Cycliste Internationale, told journalists at a press conference in Geneva: “Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling.” He added: “He deserves to be forgotten in cycling.”After absorbing the report of the US Anti-Doping Agency, which said Mr Armstrong had engaged in “serial cheating” and participated in an organised doping ring in the US Postal Services team over several years, the UCI announced it was endorsing the findings.All of Mr Armstrong’s results from August 1998 have been expunged from official records.Mr McQuaid said he was “sickened” by the report, which drew on testimony from 11 of Mr Armstrong’s ex-teammates. They were banned for six months, sanctions the UCI endorsed.Mr Armstrong has always denied doping, saying he had never tested positive for any banned substance. But he has chosen not to contest the USADA findings, and last week stepped down from chairing the Livestrong cancer charity, which had done much to burnish his reputation and to draw attention to the sport.He now faces civil suits from sponsors seeking to recoup fees, and could also lose the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Olympics. Christian Prudhomme, director of the Tour de France, said Mr Armstrong should also return his race winnings.“The UCI rules are clear: when a rider loses his title, he must reimburse his winnings,” Mr Prudhomme said.Nike and a clutch of Mr Armstrong’s sponsors have withdrawn their support for the now-retired athlete, the latest being Oakley, the sunglasses maker. But the impact of the doping scandal could have far-reaching consequences for the sport as a whole.Though Mr McQuaid said the UCI decisions marked “a landmark day for cycling”, he admitted the sport was facing its biggest crisis. Many in the sport believe the UCI is weak and incapable of reforming itself, and point to its previous opposition to the USADA’s investigation.Mr McQuaid insisted that the sport “has a future”. But he was repeatedly asked to explain the UCI’s handling of doping allegations.He talked about “the painful process of confronting its past”, adding that the governing body had nothing to hide, and that it would meet on Friday to look at measures to prevent a repeat of the scandal.Under his seven-year presidency, cycling had come a long way from the “culture of doping”, he said, and he had no intention of resigning. Of the cyclists who had cheated, he said: “I’m sorry that we couldn’t catch every damn one of them and throw them out of the sport at the time.” But he added that it was possible to let some of them and others involved in the running of teams continue in the sport.His predecessor, Hein Verbruggen, who is the UCI honorary president and a member of its management committee, has also ignored demands to step down.Mr McQuaid denied an allegation that a substantial donation from Mr Armstrong a decade ago was accepted in return for the UCI overlooking a positive test. But he said the UCI would continue to accept contributions from cyclists, adding: “The UCI aren’t like Fifa with billions in the bank.”The UCI sought to deflect some of the criticism. It argued it had tested Mr Armstrong 218 times, saying his ability to beat the system raised questions not just with the UCI but the World Anti-Doping Agency and other agencies “who accepted the results”.Though welcoming the UCI’s actions, the USADA said they did not go far enough. “There are many more details of doping that are hidden, many more doping doctors and corrupt team directors, and the omertà has not yet been fully broken,” said Travis Tygart, chief executive. “Only an independent truth and reconciliation commission can fully start cycling on the path toward true reform and provide hope for a complete break from the past.”Mr McQuaid also said the governing body would persist with a defamation case against a journalist who was one of the first to investigate Mr Armstrong’s role in doping.
340;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-22T16:23:41Z;Just do it when it comes to celebrity;Companies should look to the stars but be aware of reputational risks;"Celebrity endorsement is the most irritating form of brand-boosting marketers have yet conceived – and that’s saying something. George Clooney flirting over a Nespresso coffee machine; Andy Murray fumbling for his Rado watch in what should have been his moment of US Open glory; Brad Pitt intoning “Chanel No 5: inevitable” in the new “groundbreaking” scent campaign: the product of such tie-ups is almost always cloying or annoying or both.When Nike last week dismounted from its increasingly uncomfortable tandem ride with Lance Armstrong, part of me hoped the embarrassment of 16 years’ association with a sportsman accused of serial cheating might end the circus. But it won’t. To quote Brad, celebrity endorsements are “inevitable”. First, they make money for the brand owner. Second, celebrity scandals – however revolting or out of character – have rarely, if ever, sunk a brand completely unless you count damage to the good name of the endorsers.There are alternatives. Red Bull has helped create the wider celebrity now enjoyed by skydiver Felix Baumgartner – presumably having assessed the potential threat to the brand of a fatal disaster. Dove soap has put “ordinary people” in place of airbrushed models. Social media have given companies with a smaller budget a chance to create buzz without adding an unpredictable starlet to the payroll. But if you have cash and the right product, embrace celebrities, stop worrying – and concentrate on trying to limit the reputational risks they carry.In a 2011 paper for the Journal of Advertising Research, Anita Elberse and Jeroen Verleun asked whether celebrity backing increased sales – the number against which most marketers’ bright ideas are measured. Focusing on athletes’ support for brands, they found such endorsements generated a 4 per cent increase in turnover (about $10m of additional sales of the branded products annually), and a 0.25 per cent increase in stock returns.But if the basis of a successful celebrity tie-up is the trustworthiness, attractiveness and expertise of the endorser, it follows that sleaze, injury and old age, or underperformance, whether on the field or the silver screen, may undermine those benefits. So might overexposure – though it depends where your brand is based. In South Korea and Japan, for instance, where about half of all television commercials feature celebrities, the same personality frequently backs five or more products. According to Forbes, India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni endorses 25, including PepsiCo and Reebok.Scandals, in particular, can put a dent in sales. A different study estimated Tiger Woods’ extraordinary personal blow-up in 2009 cost Nike (which, on that occasion, stuck with its star despite increasingly lurid revelations about his extramarital affairs) lost sales of more than 1.6m branded golf balls.But such risks should be self-evident. Human excellence tarnishes, talent fades, circumstances change. This has been true since the dawn of celebrity branding in the 19th century. Eugen Sandow, the German-born Victorian strongman who once “polka-stepped across a stage” carrying a piano, complete with pianist, went on to build a British business empire, from fitness studios to cocoa with supposed health-giving benefits. But, as David Waller writes in his biography The Perfect Man, Sandow was hit by a combination of “bad luck and execrable business judgment”. Anti-German prejudice in Britain during the first world war accelerated the eventual decline of the brand – and the man.Sandow’s sad case illustrates another truth: that celebrity-backed brands are most vulnerable when they belong to the celebrity himself. In the case of arm’s length brand endorsements, it is the brand owners’ job to handle the business judgment part of the equation and prepare for the bad luck and bad behaviour that may well taint their chosen endorser. That is why the terms of celebrity contracts are getting tighter – and their duration shorter – allowing brands to choose another personality if their first choice falters.Even successful brand-celebrity relationships have a natural lifespan. As athletes improve, so returns to the brand from each subsequent big victory diminish. As a Nike ambassador, Lance Armstrong might have reached the end of the road anyway. Now his story is finishing in ignominy, not glory – but it is his undoing, not Nike’s.andrew.hill@ft.com"
341;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-19T15:32:47Z;Armstrong’s biggest sponsors sever ties;;Lance Armstrong’s largest sponsors severed ties with the former professional cyclist after allegations emerged that he was at the centre of “the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen”.Nike, Trek, RadioShack and AB InBev all dropped their sponsorship ties with Mr Armstrong, who was paid an estimated $15.3m last year in endorsement deals, according to Burns Entertainment and Sports Marketing.Sunglasses maker Oakley, his last remaining high-profile sponsor, said it was reviewing its relationship with Mr Armstrong and was awaiting a final decision from the International Cycling Union, which is expected on Monday.Sports brand Nike, which had pledged to stand by Mr Armstrong a week earlier along with his other sponsors, said it was ending its 16-year deal with the cyclist “due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade”.Mr Armstrong has vehemently denied all allegations on doping, including those raised in a US Anti-Doping Agency report, which implicated him as the leader of a doping ring resulting in him being stripped of his seven Tour de France wins.Also this week, Mr Armstrong stepped down as chairman of his Livestrong cancer charity citing the attention surrounding the doping scandal.“To spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career, I will conclude my chairmanship,” Mr Armstrong said in a statement. He did not comment about the status of his sponsors.All the sponsors reaffirmed their support for Mr Armstrong’s cancer charity, Livestrong.
342;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-19T10:10:12Z;Rabobank ends cycling sponsorship;;Cycling continued to feel the impact of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal after Dutch bank Rabobank announced it was ending sponsorship of its professional team, saying it doubted the sport could become “clean and fair”.Rabobank has been a cycling sponsor for 17 years, its name associated with a Tour de France team each year since 1984, and was funding 27 riders. Its sponsorship was worth €15m a year.Bert Bruggink, Rabobank board member, said in a statement: “We are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport. We are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future.”Cycling has a big following in Holland and the Rabobank team was in effect the Dutch national cycling squad. The bank will end its sponsorship of both the men’s and women’s professional teams at the end of the year.Mr Bruggink added: “Cycling is a beautiful sport, which millions of Dutch people enjoy and a large number of those Dutch people are clients of Rabobank. But our decision stands: we are pulling out of professional cycling. It is painful. Not just for Rabobank, but especially for the enthusiasts and the cyclists who are not to blame in this.”The doping scandal is putting increased pressure on the UCI, cycling’s governing body, to act decisively in the wake of last week’s report from the US Anti-Doping Agency. Rabobank said in its statement the report “spoke volumes”.Nike bowed to pressure this week and ended its 16-year deal with Mr Armstrong, saying he had misled the company for more than a decade. RadioShack, AB InBev and Trek also severed their ties with the seven-times winner of the Tour de France.
343;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-17T20:40:52Z;Hester has cut RBS back to healthy tissue;;The problem assets of Royal Bank of Scotland were once so huge that one could easily believe that following a slim-down there would be little left. In fact, property and shares generated by impaired debt mean the part-nationalised bank will remain a substantial landlord and private equity investor for years.That does not detract from the surgical élan shown by chief executive Stephen Hester and his lieutenants in cutting back to healthy tissue.The latest waymarker will be an early exit from costly government credit insurance. This covered loans totalling £282bn in 2008. The sum has shrunk to £105bn. With RBS contracted to take the first £60bn of any loss, the insurance had become superfluous.The scheme covered assets deemed both core and non-core. The non-core division of RBS, run by Rory Cullinan, a man with a brief to put himself out of a job, started with £258bn of unwanted assets. These did not include insurer Direct Line, which RBS has floated, or the 316 branches Santander has declined to buy.The total had fallen to £72bn by the second half of 2012. It will be about £60bn by new year and £40bn by the end of 2013. The reduction bolsters capital and brings the privatisation of the state’s stake in the group closer.RBS expects to shed another £20bn over the next three years through the run-off of loans. That will still leave it owning swaths of property “inherited” from bankrupt developers, many of them Irish, and shares garnered through debt-for-equity swaps. These shareholdings are managed by a specialist unit whose deals have included the Hong Kong float of luggage group Samsonite.It is a small mercy that in the wake of the credit crunch RBS has shown the professionalism so depressingly absent in the run-up to it.…Splintered TenonReputation is everything in professional services, which is why RSM Tenon’s shambolic start to 2012 was so dreadful, writes Adam Jones. By its own admission, the auditor and consultant mismanaged its past acquisition-led growth, letting costs run ahead of its ability to generate sales. Worse, it had to restate accounts in February after significant errors were discovered – something that hardly projects an aura of steady competence to clients.Under Chris Merry, the chief executive brought in to fix the mess, the worst has been averted, at least. Lloyds, which is owed about £80m, has agreed to keep lending until the end of 2014. It could have cast the company adrift at the end of this month. Now Mr Merry and the other new brooms in charge need to retain and recruit enough customers to turn the company round. This will be no easy feat given the blow RSM Tenon’s reputation has suffered.Owen Jones, a Shore Capital analyst with a buy recommendation on the shares, forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 2.5p this year. Using a similar multiple to Begbies Traynor, an Aim-quoted rival, this would imply a share price of about 14p, he reckons. That suggests Wednesday’s bounce, which saw the shares rise 17.5 per cent to 6.4p, might not be a one-off. But those with less skin in the game than Lloyds might hesitate before betting too much on a full recovery.…Just don’t dope itA top sportsperson may be forgiven for cheating on a spouse. But when evidence that they may have cheated in competition mounts, they cross a red line for sponsors such as Nike, which has just withdrawn its support for cyclist Lance Armstrong.Nike stood by Tiger Woods when his marital infidelity prompted AT&T and Accenture to drop the golfer like a hot putter three years ago. But the telecoms and accountancy groups arguably valued Mr Woods’ clean-cut personal brand as much as his dexterity with a club.Allegations from the US Anti-Doping Agency that Mr Armstrong was as dependent on blood transfusions for his vigour as Count Dracula bring into question whether he ever truly exemplified sporting excellence. And that was the quality that Nike prized most. “Just dope it” is hardly an acceptable reworking of the company’s slogan.Mr Armstrong, who has stepped down as chairman of the Livestrong cancer charity made an estimated $15m from sponsorship in 2011. Remaining sponsors such as AB InBev will study the withdrawal of Nike carefully.The uncomfortable reality for a sponsor is that linking its name to sports stars has big downsides. Not only that they may lose, but that they may win unfairly and get caught.
344;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-17T17:28:16Z;Armstrong sponsors backpedal on deals;;Nike, RadioShack, AB InBev and Trek have dropped their sponsorship deals with Lance Armstrong, once one of the world’s most endorsed athletes, as the fallout from the doping scandal surrounding the disgraced cyclist escalates.Sports brand Nike said that it was terminating its 16-year deal with the cyclist “due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade”.Electronics retailer RadioShack, which had a multiyear agreement with Armstrong starting in July 2009, said it had “no current obligations” with the seven-times winner of the Tour de France, who had his titles stripped in August. Trek bicycles also said it was terminating its long-term relationship with Mr Armstrong.AB InBev, which sponsors Mr Armstrong under its Michelob Ultra beer brand, said it would not renew its relationship, which expires at the end of this year.A US Anti-Doping Agency report last week put Mr Armstrong at the centre of “the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen”.He has vehemently denied the allegations of doping and has said it is the result of a vendetta against him. Bill Stapleton, Mr Armstrong’s agent, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.Mr Armstrong earned an estimated $15.3m from high-profile sponsors in 2011, according to Burns Entertainment and Sports Marketing. His contract with Nike alone was worth between $8m to $12m annually, according to Burns.Another major sponsor Oakley sunglasses said it was reviewing its deal with Mr Armstrong.“Our policy with our athletes is to support them until proven guilty by the highest governing body of sport or court of law,” Oakley said in a statement. “We are reviewing the extensive report from the Usada, as well as our relationship with Lance, and will await final decision-making by the International Cycling Union.”Only last week Nike had continued to stand by the cyclist, saying: “We are saddened that Lance Armstrong may no longer be able to participate in certain competitions and his titles appear to be impacted. Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position.”The news came as Mr Armstrong announced on Wednesday that he would step down as chairman of Livestrong, his cancer foundation that has generated $430m in revenues since its inception in 1997 according to Burns. Nike, RadioShack, AB InBev and Trek all said they would continue to support the Livestrong foundation.“To spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career, I will conclude my chairmanship,” Mr Armstrong said in a statement. “[My family and I] plan to continue our service to the foundation and the cancer community. We will remain active advocates for cancer survivors and engaged supporters of the fight against cancer.”Mr Armstrong was instrumental in Nike’s expansion into cycling. He appeared in multiple campaigns for the brand including a 2001 advertisement featuring footage of him having blood drawn for a drug test and challenging those who accused him of doping.The 30-second ad featured Mr Armstrong saying: “Everybody wants to know what I’m on. What am I on? I’m on my bike, busting my ass six hours a day. What are you on?”Sports marketing experts said Nike had probably cut its ties with Mr Armstrong – after previously continuing to support other athletes embroiled in controversy such as golfer Tiger Woods and football player Michael Vick – because of the connection to drugs and cheating in the sport.“Nike is authentically and has always been about performance in sport. Lance Armstrong cheated in his sport. Nike had no choice,” said Kevin Adler, founder of Engage Marketing, a Chicago-based sports and entertainment marketing company.RadioShack sponsored Mr Armstrong’s final two years as a professional cyclist. He was instrumental in building the team, which long-time ally Johan Bruyneel managed. Mr Bruyneel, who is facing his own Usada case, parted ways with RadioShack last week.

The benchmark index closed 0.8 per cent higher to 1,440.12.“The pullback in the markets is not surprising especially this early in the earnings season. But today’s retail data suggesting stronger consumer confidence coupled with improving housing data has lifted the stocks,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.“We are optimistic about third-quarter earnings because we expect upside surprises as analysts were too pessimistic in light of lowered guidance from companies,” Ms Sonders added.Fresh economic data released on Monday showed that US retail sales grew in September at a faster rate than expected, in what some suggested was a sign that consumer confidence was improving.Shares in Fossil, the watch and jewellery retailer, rose 2.8 per cent to $85.09. Ralph Lauren, the fashion retailer, moved 3.2 per cent higher to $159.81.Positive retail data benefited homebuilders, with the S&P subgroup gaining 4 per cent. PulteGroup rallied 5 per cent to $16.40, Lennar rose 3.6 per cent to $6.32 and DR Horton added 3.5 per cent to $5.76.This week investors will focus on earnings as 80 companies in the S&P 500 index will report results, with analysts expecting a near 3 per cent decline in profits during the third quarter, the first such decline since late 2009.Among today’s earnings releases, media group Gannet, owner of USA Today, reported a 33 per cent increase in third-quarter net income to $133.1m, fuelled by increases in political and Olympic ad spending in its television group. However, the company’s shares dropped 0.3 per cent to $17.85.Healthcare stocks led the gains on the S&P 500 index, with the sector gaining 1.4 per cent after positive news from pharmaceutical companies.Eli Lilly rallied 41 per cent to $52.53 after the drugmaker said its experimental drug for treating stomach cancer, Ramucirumab, helped patients with a form of the disease live longer in a late-stage study.Drugmakers Bristol-Myers and Merck also rose, gaining 2.5 per cent to $33.93 and 2.1 per cent to $46.59 respectively.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 3,064.18. Apple shares traded in and out of positive territory and closed 0.8 per cent higher at $634.76 amid speculation that the group was set to release a smaller version of its iPad later this month.Sprint Nextel shares closed 0.7 per cent lower to $5.69 as SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms group, said it would acquire a 70 per cent stake in the company for $20.1bn. Once completed, the deal would create the world’s third-largest mobile phone operator by revenues. Shares in rival MetroPCS dropped 4.6 per cent to $11.33.Texas Instruments shares rose 3.4 per cent to $28.22 amid reports from Calcalist that Amazon planned to buy the company’s mobile chip activities, as the largest online retailer seeks to provide processors for smartphones and tablets. Amazon shares initially fell as much as 3 per cent but rebounded to close 0.7 per cent higher at $244.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.7 per cent higher at 13,424.30.Nike shares gained 1.2 per cent to $95.61 as a report by the Financial Times said the sportswear company would stand by Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist who stands accused of serial cheating throughout his career.CONSOL Energy shares dropped 2.2 per cent to $34.36 after the coal producer said in a statement that idling coal mines took their toll on third-quarter earnings, resulting in a loss. Shares in the company rallied last week, gaining 12 per cent.Workday, a HR software provider that listed its initial public offering in New York last Friday, gained 6.7 per cent to $51.94. The company, which offered its shares to investors at a price of $28, has seen its stock price gain 83.9 per cent since it began trading.
346;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Sponsors stand by Lance Armstrong;;Lance Armstrong’s high-profile sponsors, including Nike and Anheuser-Busch, are standing by the professional cyclist despite official accusations of serial cheating throughout his 19-year career.Nike, RadioShack and Anheuser-Busch have all come out in support of Mr Armstrong in the wake of a 200-page US Anti-Doping Agency report, released last week, that implicated him in a ring that encouraged the use of banned substances and practices while he was on the US Postal Service cycling team.Mr Armstrong, who has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, has denied the allegations, although he did not challenge the USADA report and received a lifetime ban from professional cycling competition earlier this year.“Lance’s primary sponsors have been incredibly supportive and have remained supportive throughout,” said Bill Stapleton, Mr Armstrong’s agent. “Brands are looking for an authentic endorser and at the end of the day they depend on the authenticity of the athlete.”Mr Armstrong is one of the world’s highest paid athletes via endorsements, pulling in an estimated $15.3m from sponsors in 2011, with partnerships ranging from Michelob Ultra beer to Oakley sunglasses and Trek bicycles.His net worth is estimated at $125m, according to Bob Williams, chief executive of Burns Entertainment and Sports Marketing.Oakley and Trek did not respond to requests for comments. Many of Mr Armstrong’s personal sponsors also support Livestrong, the brand associated with the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Livestrong has raised more than $470m.The organisation does not fund cancer research but works to “improve quality of life for members of the global cancer community”. Its yellow wristband motif is now featured on everything from treadmills to investment portfolios.“We are saddened that Lance Armstrong may no longer be able to participate in certain competitions and his titles appear to be impacted,” said Mary Remuzzi, Nike spokesperson. “Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position. Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation.”Mr Armstrong has been a face of Nike since 1996 and was instrumental in the US sportswear company’s expansion into cycling. He has appeared in multiple campaigns for the brand including a 2001 advertisement featuring footage of Armstrong having blood drawn for a drug test and challenging those who accused him of doping.The 30-second ad featured Mr Armstrong saying, “Everybody wants to know what I’m on. What am I on? I’m on my bike, busting my ass six hours a day. What are you on?” he says.The USADA report includes the allegation that Mr Armstrong had a suspicious test for EPO during the 2001 Tour of Switzerland. The report said there was “proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Lance Armstrong engaged in serial cheating through the use, administration and trafficking of performance enhancing drugs and methods”.RadioShack, the US electronics retailer, also stood beside Mr Armstrong, although on Friday it ended a relationship with Johan Bruyneel, the former manager of Mr Armstrong’s US Postal Service team. Mr Bruyneel, a former close associate of Mr Armstrong, was implicated in the USADA report and is facing a pending doping case. “We recognise the serious nature of the situation and we are continuing to monitor these events closely as the process unfolds. RadioShack remains focused on our shared commitment with Livestrong and the fight against cancer,” a RadioShack spokesperson said.Steve Centrillo, founder of smiths, a brand navigation agency, said Mr Armstrong’s life story as a cancer survivor could help him escape from the doping controversy relatively unscathed. “Lance has somehow or another become Teflon for a lot of people. He is known for what he did with his life off the bike,” he said.Mr Centrillo said this situation and other recent scandals including golfer Tiger Woods’s sexual indiscretions and baseball player Barry Bonds, convicted of perjury, will force brands to think twice before signing on an athlete.“Now there will always be a degree of nervousness that is going to be attached to these deals,” he saidAdditional reporting by Emily Steel
347;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-12T20:13:48Z;Stocks end week on sour note;;Friday 21.10 BST. Most global stock markets ended the week on a sour note and the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly drop in four months, as worries about weak global growth and its impact on corporate profitability, offset a handful of upbeat corporate reports.The broad measure of US stocks ended the session 0.3 per cent lower, wrapping up a 2.2 per cent decline in the week, as investors shunned data showing the strongest US consumer confidence numbers in five years.The dollar index also fell, trading 0.1 per cent lower and higher demand pushed 10-year yields down 1 basis point to 1.65 per cent.The FTSE All-World equity index fell 0.2 per cent on the day, but stocks in Asia rose 0.4 per cent.Gold ended the week at $1,753 an ounce, but the amount of bullion held in gold-focused exchange traded products hit a record 2,583 metric tonnes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The pullback on Wall Street came as traders continued to fret about prospects for the rest of the global economy and how this would be shown affecting company earnings and forecasts during the US third-quarter reporting season.Company announcements continued on Friday with reports from two of the country’s largest financial institutions.In spite of the strong performance in mortgages, the results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have not been particularly well-received, a reaction that dovetails with a sense of increasing microeconomic pessimism following downbeat statements from the likes of Chevron, the energy group, Cummins, the engineer, Alcoa, the aluminium producer and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.Shares in Indian software group Infosys slumped on Friday after revenue forecasts were shy of analysts’ expectations, contributing to a 0.7 per cent drop for the Sensex.The dip was in contrast to much of Asia as the region welcomed the US jobs data overnight and also efforts by Japan and China to reduce tensions over a territorial dispute that has been hurting the two countries’ economic relations.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was down just 0.2 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.7 per cent and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1 per cent ahead of the release of major Chinese economic indicators next week.Trade data are set to be unveiled on Saturday, with inflation numbers due on Monday and third-quarter growth figures on Thursday.Meanwhile, the euro rose 0.2 per cent to $1.2958 amid rumours that Spain will seek a bailout this weekend, despite its finance minister saying on Friday his country is not being pressured to do so.The yield on Madrid’s 10-year paper fell 14bp on the day to 5.63 per cent.“If Spain delays requesting for help, market sentiment should gradually deteriorate,” analysts at Barclays say. “If it does make the request, we would expect the [euro] rally to have legs”.Industrial commodities also struggled to make much headway as this week’s International Monetary Fund downgrade of its forecast for global economic expansion weighed on sentiment.Copper fell 0.8 per cent to $3.7 a pound and Brent crude fell 80 cents to $114.73 a barrel.Additional reporting by Jamie Chisholm in London
348;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-05T15:29:46Z;Sportswear – an uneven struggle;Big names dominate with smaller brands lagging;There are no prizes for also-rans – just ask shareholders in JJB Sports, the UK retailer that went bust this week after failing to compete effectively with Sports Direct. What goes for the sports retailers also goes for the goods they stock. The global sportswear market is increasingly dominated by the big names, with smaller brands struggling to compete. Only Nike, Jordan and Adidas have managed to increase market share in the US this year, for example, Morgan Stanley notes. Second-tier brands such as Asics, Reebok (which is owned by Adidas), Puma and New Balance are all losing out.The uneven struggle is likely to continue. Nike and Adidas can put the big bucks into R&D for new products, while they also spend heavily on celebrity endorsements. Scale also gives them the ability jump into attractive niches. Puma blazed a trail in fashion sportswear which, according to Euromonitor, is now the fastest growing part of the European market. But Adidas saw the attraction and recruited rapper Snoop Dogg to help it muscle in.Investors should follow consumer preferences. A strong performance from the main brand means that revenues at Adidas are expected to grow 12 per cent this year, while most rivals will manage only mid-single digits. At Nike, sales growth will be a more pedestrian 5 per cent but its 13 per cent operating margin is well ahead of the pack. Meanwhile, Puma warned on profits earlier this year, sales forecasts for Reebok have been cut and Nike has put its Umbro unit up for sale.Their differing performance is partly reflected in the price. With an enterprise value that is 12 times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Nike trades at a hefty premium to the sector average of nine times. Adidas’ shares have been impressive performers in the year to date, rising 30 per cent, but a multiple of 10 suggests there is scope for them to keep on running.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
349;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-10-04T17:07:44Z;I have seen the future and it’s worn;Wearable technology has mostly failed to live up to its promise – until now;"Scottevest Fleece 7.0
Rating: 4/5Last month Google Glass, the internet-connected headwear being developed by Google, made an appearance on the catwalk when Diane von Furstenberg incorporated the technology into her New York Fashion Week show.Google’s subsequent posting online of footage of the show recorded by the camera in the Glass headset, highlighted the increasingly blurred lines between technology, clothing and mobility.For years, engineers have envisaged technology so personal that “body area networks” would have wide applications in clothing and other worn items such as earrings. So far, the reality has fallen short of this sci-fi vision, although notable tech togs have included Spytech’s ties with a built-in video camera, which are still available. Some years ago, Burton, the snowboard kit and clothing maker, joined with Motorola to design a jacket that wirelessly connected a mobile phone or iPod in a pocket to stereo speakers in the hood and a microphone near the collar. A panel on the sleeve allowed users to make calls or switch songs on the iPod. Sadly, the tech was not up to the task, and the jacket is no longer made.Undeterred, Scottevest has now embraced the concept of wearable tech and I have been testing its Fleece 7.0, which will go on sale in the US (for about $160) and elsewhere this month (non-US prices not yet available). Many of its 23 pockets are designed to carry digital cameras, iPads or other similar-size tablets, and it must have seemed just the next step to have a smartphone pocket that can be wired via an internal cable channel built into the fleece to a pair of earbuds that tuck away into two “budbucket” pockets in the collar when not in use.I found it easy to control my iPhone touchscreen through the pocket’s plastic window, which will be a boon when the weather gets cold. In addition, there are no dangling cables.Most wearable technology is used in health and personal fitness. Examples include the Nike+ range, some of which pairs a sensor in a running shoe with an iPod app or wrist band that displays steps taken, average speed and calories burned. I especially like the simplicity of the $60 (£45) Nike+ Sportband kit, with a sensor that fits in Nike+ trainers and connects wirelessly with the Sportband to provide a visual readout of your time, speed and distance.Blacksocks, which runs a subscription sock service, has just launched Smarter Socks, which have a button enabled for Near Field Communication, used for fast wireless exchanges of data, sewn in. A $189 kit comprising 10 pairs and a handheld NFC reader that communicates via Bluetooth to a free downloadable iPhone app enables users to keep socks in pairs.First, you identify the socks in pairs by touching the NFC button to the sensor. When they have been laundered touching each sock button again with the reader shows which socks go together on the iPhone app screen. It was easy to set up and quite fun to use. But since all the Blacksocks smarter socks are indeed black I’m not sure what the point of pairing them up is. But the app also enables you to track the age of socks; judge how far they have faded using digital images; count how often they have been washed; and tells you when to order new ones.Blacksocks plans an app to work with NFC-enabled Android handsets, which will remove the need for the dedicated NFC reader.Using NFC for socks may seem like overkill, but perhaps, just like Google Glass, it is a sign that innovations merging apparel and technology really are getting closer.Planet of the AppsWhat it is: Snapheal for Apple Mac version 2.0Why you should try it: Now you see it, now you don’t.

350;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-09-28T21:46:20Z;Weekly losses on Wall St trim quarterly gains;;Wall Street energy stocks rode a tide of rising commodity prices to register as the best performing sector group among US equities for the third quarter.The S&P 500 energy index rose 9.5 per cent, standing out against the broader market which gained just 5.8 per cent for the three month period beginning at the start of July.Oil refiners led the gains for energy stocks, which tracked a run-up in the price of crude for much of the quarter before giving up some gains as prices fell in September.The gains for petroleum companies such as Tesoro Corporation, which climbed 67.9 per cent in the quarter to $41.90, came as structural changes helped improve the US industry’s competitive advantage over non-US producers.Philip Weiss, analyst at Argus, said those changes included more access to cheaper onshore US crude and lower-priced US natural gas, which lowered production costs for refiners.Mr Weiss said he expected those changes to remain in place but reduced his recommendation of one refiner, Valero Energy, which gained 31.2 per cent to $31.68 for the quarter, from “buy” to “hold”.Valero’s capital requirements made it less preferable to investors than its peers, Mr Weiss said, adding that energy stocks had historically been among the most volatile US equities.Other refiners that enjoyed strong gains in the quarter included Phillips 66, which moved 39.5 per cent higher to $46.33, and Marathon Petroleum, which rose 21.5 per cent to $54.59.Overall, the broader S&P 500 finished the quarter with a second consecutive week of losses. Investors have shunned equities in the latter half of September after making strong advances following the announcement of stimulus action by the Federal Reserve that boosted stocks to their best level of the year.The S&P 500 was down 1.3 per cent to 1,440.67 for the week, and has risen 14.6 per cent from the start of the year.Equities have retreated from their highest level of the year, when they were up as much as 17.3 per cent, after a pick-up earlier in the month when the European Central Bank and the Federal Receive each took monetary measures to help the flagging economies in Europe and the US.Consumer discretionary stocks were among the week’s heaviest fallers. Nike shares suffered as the sportswear company said late on Thursday its Asian business had slowed. Shares in Nike were 1.7 per cent lower for the week to $94.91 but were up 8.1 per cent for the quarter.Christian Buss, analyst at Credit Suisse, said that the slowdown in its Chinese business was particularly critical as it is the highest margin segment of Nike’s operations. Mr Buss said the company’s earnings would remain under pressure through to next May as a result.Overall, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell 1.6 per cent with sector losses exacerbated by a 2.1 per cent drop in McDonald’s shares to $91.75. The world’s largest restaurant chain, up 3.6 per cent for the quarter, received a handful of downgrades on Friday as analysts questioned the company’s growth prospects.Research In Motion was among the week’s best performing stocks as investors reacted positively to its fiscal second-quarter results released late in the week. Shares in the BlackBerry maker rose 16.2 per cent for the week to $7.53, after it reported on Thursday afternoon that losses in its most recent quarter were less than expected.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 2 per cent to 3,116.23. The tech-heavy index was up 6.2 per cent for the quarter, but much of its gains have been driven by the iPhone and iPad maker, which is the largest company on the index.Shares in Apple lost 4.2 per cent to $667.91, capping off a week that began with enthusiasm about the record sales of its new smartphone. That initial excitement slipped away as some users expressed concerns over a key software application on the phone.Tim Cook, chief executive, apologised to iPhone 5 customers on Friday over its new Maps application’s inadequate service . Still, Apple shares have risen 14.2 per cent in the three month period.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1 per cent to 13,437.13 and was up 4.3 per cent for the quarter.Shares in General Electric, the US industrial group, rose 0.8 per cent to $22.71 for the week. On Thursday, the company said a global downturn had not affected its business as much as others and strengthened its outlook for 2012 and 2013. GE shares were up 9 per cent for the quarter.
351;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike caught out as China slows;;Nike reported a fall in new orders in China and said it would revamp its strategy in the country as investor concern over its performance sent its shares down.The US sportswear company said on Thursday that new orders from its greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were 5 per cent below their level a year ago, confirming a slowdown in a crucial market.Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, said all retailers in China were grappling with a combination of slowing economic growth, excess inventory, and more discerning consumers.“This is a natural evolution that we’ve seen in many markets, so it’s not a surprise. What is a surprise, like everything in China, is how fast it got here,” he told analysts.Nike shares initially fell more than 4 per cent in after market trading when its results were released, but later recovered slightly to be down 3.2 per cent at $92.90.Eric Tracy, managing director at Janney Montgomery Scott, said: “Most people knew China was having difficulties but they didn’t expect it to deteriorate as quickly as it did.”Nike executives said they would “reset” the market in China by working with retailers to clear excess inventory, improving distribution through Nike-branded stores and tailoring merchandise better to what Chinese consumers want.Mr Denson said: “So everybody wants to know, how long will it take? I can’t answer that with a specific date, what I can tell is you I’m confident we’re taking the right actions.”Globally, new orders, a key measure of the company’s future revenues, were up 6 per cent from a year ago, but fell short of Wall Street expectations. The orders are due for delivery through January.Overall the group posted a 12 per cent fall in net income to $567m in the three months to the end of August, although the decline was not as sharp as Wall Street had forecast.Nike’s profitability has been eroding due to higher production costs and marketing spending.Revenues rose 10 per cent to $6.7bn, ahead of expectations, helped by sales linked to the Euro 2012 football tournament and the London Olympics, where Nike’s neon yellow Volt shoes were ubiquitous in athletics.Several western consumer groups have already reported that they are being hit by reduced economic growth in China.Mr Tracy said Nike’s fall in new orders reflected a combination of economic weakness and sector-specific problems.“The macro slowdown doesn’t help. But there is a specific issue in the athletic, footwear and apparel channel. There is glut of competitors not performing well, being highly promotional and that is causing havoc across the category.”Recalling that Nike entered China 30 years ago, Mark Parker, chief executive, said: “Today, like then, China defies predictions or timetables. But what is certain is that China offers more opportunity for Nike today than it ever has, and I’m completely committed to extending our leadership position there.”
352;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-09-21T16:50:22Z;Nike and Apple – if the shoe fits;Trainer brand should emulate the iPhone maker and protect its margins;Apple is not the only company offering a shiny new toy this week. Nike will begin selling its latest shoe on Saturday – the LeBron X+, named for LeBron James, the Miami Heat forward. The gaudiest version of the shoe includes sensors that allow you to track yourself on the court and analyse and share the information using a mobile app. (That “kit” can be used with other shoes too.) A pair will sell for $270.Nike and Apple are alike in many ways, but also very different. Both have premium brands, but their financial positions diverge. Leverage from runaway sales growth has driven Apple’s gross margins up 6 percentage points to 47 per cent in the past year. In Nike’s case, revenue in the fourth quarter that ended in May rose 12 per cent to $6.5bn, its highest quarterly number. Nonetheless, the cost of materials and labour in China helped push gross margins down 1.5 percentage points from the year before, the sixth consecutive annual decline. Net profit fell 8 per cent.Nike needs to bring in higher prices: what it charges now is not keeping up with costs. Basketball shoes may not be the problem. Nike’s basketball category, which includes the LeBron and Jordan lines, reported $2.2bn in revenue for fiscal 2012, up 17 per cent year on year. The general point holds, though: if a company is given credit for owning great brands, it should be able to protect margins.Despite a sharp drop in its share price after its latest earnings report, Nike still gets a premium rating from the stock market. Its shares trade at 19 times forward earnings, compared with a multiple of 17 times for rival Adidas. The latter has brand problems of its own, after cutting sales expectations for its Reebok line by a third on Friday. At $97 apiece, Nike’s shares are less expensive than a pair of LeBrons. But they look overpriced unless the company’s unimpressive margin performance improves soon.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
353;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-09-20T21:11:17Z;Wall Street flat on downbeat data;;JC Penney shares tumbled 11.2 per cent to $25.83, making it the worst performer on the S&P 500 index on Thursday, as investors appeared unconvinced by the retailer’s presentation of its revamped stores. The retailer’s comments that the second half of the year would be similar to the first were also discouraging.“Given the stock run over the past month, we believe the stock reflects more optimistic near-term assumptions than are likely,” wrote analysts at Atlantic Equities.“While we expect the JC Penney stock to be volatile over the near-term (partly due to the 40 per cent short interest), we remain ‘neutral’ and will look for clearer direction heading into the new year.”Bed Bath & Beyond was also among the laggards on US equity markets, falling 9.7 per cent to $62.09 after the home-furnishing chain reported second-quarter results below Wall Street’s expectations.By contrast, ConAgra Foods rose 6.2 per cent to $27.24 after the quarterly profits beat analysts’ expectations and the company raised its guidance and increased dividends.In the wider market, stocks recouped earlier losses and major indices were little changed on Thursday amid a batch of disappointing economic news from the US, Europe and China.Initial claims for US jobless benefits fell less than expected with the less volatile four-week average reports trending upwards, the eurozone private sector contracted sharply, and manufacturing in China continued to slow.“We are in a period when euphoria from the actions of the largest central banks has faded,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.Mr Canally added that investors are now waiting and wondering why China had not acted yet. “While immediate risks from Europe are off the table, macro risks are still there. Investors are concerned about economic and company-specific fundamentals heading into the third-quarter earnings season.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed virtually flat at 1,460.27 after falling as much as 0.6 per cent in the morning. Industrials and financials sectors were the main laggards, down 0.9 and 0.6 per cent respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent up at 13,597.16 after trading in narrow range, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 3,175.96.United States Steel and Union Pacific Corporation were hit hard, down 3.5 per cent to $20.13 and 3.3 per cent to $120.95 respectively. Norfolk Southern, the railroad operator, tumbled 9 per cent to $66.11 as the company’s forecasts came in below analysts’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, seen as a barometer of the economic health fell 2.7 per cent.Banking stocks were also in focus after reports that regulators were seeking more time to complete their investigations of banks allegedly involved in manipulation of Libor and other key interest rates.Meanwhile, UBS cut its ratings on Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to “neutral” from “buy”, saying these banks had fully participated in the sector’s rally.Citigroup lost 1.1 per cent to $33.81, Goldman fell 1.2 per cent to $117.63 and Morgan Stanley slid 2 per cent to $17.21.JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, also fell 0.2 per cent to $41.25.Bank of America fell 1 per cent to $9.19 amid reports that the bank was speeding up a planned reduction of 30,000 staff to counter falling revenues by cutting costs. The bank was said to be planning to cut more than 15,000 jobs by the end of the year.In earnings news, Jefferies, the midsize investment bank, reported higher third-quarter profit as revenue from trading activity more than doubled. The stock, however, fell 7.3 per cent to $14.52, as some investors expressed concerns over the company’s long-term growth trajectory.In the technology sector, Oracle shares closed 1.6 per cent lower at $32.26, but continued to fall in after-hours trading following the release of quarterly earnings. The software maker’s revenues and earnings came in below analysts’ expectations.Oracle’s results are closely watched by analysts, who expect the company to provide some clues as to whether corporations will increase spending on technology at the end of the year.Adobe rose 4.3 per cent to $34.53 as analysts at RBC Capital Markets upgraded it to “outperform”, even after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software issued a lower outlook for the current quarter. The company said its customers’ faster-than-expected switch to its new subscription-based model will dent its earnings.AOL shares fell 0.3 per cent to $34.48. The internet company appointed Karen Dykstra, a former hedge fund executive, as chief financial officer on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel fell 2.2 per cent to $5.44 even after the fourth-largest mobile provider said it had sold 1m phones that support LTE, a high-speed wireless technology it is building into its network.Nike said its board had approved to use cash to buy back $8bn in shares over four years on top of an existing $5bn share buyback programme. Its stock fell 1 per cent to $96.72.General Motors shares fell 1.3 per cent to $24.42 as talks between the Canadian Auto Workers union and the carmaker stalled, with a CAW official calling a quick breakthrough on an overall deal “unlikely”.GM will also this week begin to bid for Ally Financial’s auto-lending operations in Europe and Latin America.
354;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-09-18T13:00:16Z;Contour adds data to action-video sharing;;Contour is first out of the gate with a new hands-free video camera going on sale today, ahead of fresh competition from Sony and an expected product announcement from GoPro in October.The Contour+2 is the only camera of this type, popular with sports enthusiasts, to be made available in the Apple Store and it has a much improved iOS app to go with it.The video camera itself has undergone a few changes since I reviewed its predecessor, the Contour+, in February. Contour says image sharpness, the speed of adjustment to lighting changes and underwater video quality have all been improved.The company is making it more affordable – at $400 it is $100 cheaper than the + and a waterproof case is now included.The Contour Connect app connects over Bluetooth to the camera and now, as well as acting as a viewfinder, allows recording to be stopped and started from your iPhone. Contour says the stability of the connection has also been improved.The Storyteller editing software for Mac and Windows has improved visualisation and playback of GPS data from the camera – map insets and charts showing speed, elevation and distance can be seen during video playback.This embedded data can also be shared with the video on YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook. UPDATE: Contour now says this updated version of Storyteller will not be available until October.“It’s basically Nike + meets video, it’s the first time you’re able to capture video and data and share it online,” Marc Barros, Contour chief executive, told me.He started his company out of a garage eight years ago and says the category is booming as video recording products get smaller, more connected and make sharing easier on social networks.Contour’s other product is the Roam, half the price of the +2 at $200, but lacking its Bluetooth connectivity and data capabilities.Sony is due to introduce its AS10 and AS15 “action camcorders” at the end of the month, with the AS15 having the additional feature of Wi-Fi to link up with its own smartphone app.
355;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Too big to scale creative heights;Ad agencies fear they have become too large to make cutting-edge work;"Bob Greenberg woke up one morning recently, terrified that R/GA, the digital advertising agency he founded more than three decades ago, had become too big to manage.The agency behind the Nike+ runner and other notable campaigns had evolved into exactly the kind of bureaucratic company against which he had famously rebelled. When he walked through the agency’s four buildings in New York, he did not know many of the roughly 1,000 employees working there.The company, which is owned by Interpublic, the US-based advertising holding company, had become so large that it could take on only work for big clients, eliminating smaller brands that are keen to experiment with edgier ideas – the type of work that attracts the industry’s hot, young creative talent.Mr Greenberg had never intended for R/GA to grow into one of the largest advertising companies in New York – let alone expand into more than a dozen markets across the globe. “It felt like we were losing some of the controls that would affect the quality of our work,” he says. “Something was missing.”Mr Greenberg is grappling with the question now plaguing several digital advertising executives: “How big can we get before we get bad?”Jay Chiat, the late ad executive, tried to deal with this challenge as his eponymous advertising agency grew into an international powerhouse in the 1990s, staffed with more than 1,200 employees and generating more than $1bn in sales.As many digital advertising agencies approach 20 years since they were founded, executives are worried that their companies are becoming too large and too corporate to keep the spark of creativity alive and to continue producing cutting-edge creative work that can compete with more nimble, smaller start-ups.“You have to be fierce about that culture. It is what you are selling,” says Tim Andree, chief executive and president of Dentsu Network, the Japanese advertising company that recently acquired Aegis, the London-based advertising business.The challenge of preserving that original culture is particularly acute in the world of digital marketing where technologies change rapidly.“Our culture, our creativity is the only sustainable competitive advantage that an agency has. Whatever we do now will be outdated in a year,” says Bryan Wiener, chief executive of 360i, the US agency owned by Dentsu and whose clients include Coca-Cola, Oreo and JC Penney.To keep the small agency feel, Mr Wiener has split up the 400-person company into teams of five to 25 people that work autonomously, almost as if they are their own agency within the broader organisation. “Great things happen in small packages,” he says.Other companies are co-opting techniques from the technology world. AKQA, the digital agency that in June was acquired by WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, is attempting to replicate Silicon Valley’s “fail fast” mantra by creating its own version of “hackathons” – a tradition at Facebook to develop quickly new ideas and products. AKQA holds meetings for its creatives, where they are given a prompt to create a concept or product, and are expected to return with an idea in four hours rather than the typical weeks such tasks can take.Some of the world’s biggest advertising agencies were once the young hotshots of the industry and are employing different strategies to hold on to the best aspect of their young selves●R/GA The agency founded by Bob Greenberg and now owned by Interpublic is adding consultancy services for the brands for which it works and splitting teams into 150-people units.

●AKQA
The agency was acquired by WPP in June. It uses its own versions of “hackathons”, a technique used in the technology sector by companies such as Facebook, which entails giving creative staff a brief and just four hours, instead of weeks, to come up with a concept or product.

●360i
The digital agency owned by Dentsu, the Japanese advertising company, employs 400 people but they are split up into teams of five to 25, and work autonomously of the rest of the organisation.The cultural question often comes to a head when advertising agencies merge. Big holding companies have acquired a series of digital outfits in recent years, making it more difficult for those agencies to maintain their creative independence.Take Possible Worldwide, for example. WPP created the business over the last year and a half by merging nine digital advertising agencies that it had acquired since 2005. Possible has more than 1,500 employees in 23 offices worldwide. The idea was that as one unit, the companies would be better positioned to take on work from big advertisers that increasingly are demanding sophisticated technologies and global campaigns.The plan, however, failed. About a year and a half after the merger, the company had not won a single global account. Several senior executives have left and WPP recruited a new chief executive, Shane Atchison, who is rethinking how to structure the agency to rejuvenate the company’s culture and creativity.“It wasn’t working,” Mr Atchison says. “The companies had just given up their brands for the promise of a greater possibility, the greater opportunity of a new brand. They didn’t fulfil that. The soul of why people are proud of where they work was not there.”The 39-year-old has spent the first months of his tenure visiting the company’s offices. In attempts to communicate his vision for Possible in terms that resonate with the company’s young staff, he has worked with a 27-year-old employee to ghostwrite emails about his vision for the company – but has not told employees that someone else was helping to write his messages. He says he is cognisant of the fact they could be considered inauthentic and disconnected but thinks they help rally support for his strategy.“The reason is not to be lazy,” he explains. “It is what you would do if you were Coca-Cola and trying to market to a younger demographic. You hire people who understand that demographic.”To spark momentum and inject a sense of pride in the creative output at the company, he produced a new website, logo and a private social network for the agency. Employees are required to write 10 original posts for the company’s network each year, highlighting inspiration and featuring accomplishments at the agency. “Just talking about culture is hilarious. You have to focus on the people,” he says.Mr Greenberg of R/GA, meanwhile, is attempting to push his company through a transformation before it starts falling behind. The agency remains one of the most highly acclaimed in the industry, winning awards and working with leading brands.But since he started the company, he has transformed its structure every nine years. The company is entering a new phase he is calling “functional integration”. Mr Greenberg says he does not like the name but that it connotes the idea of creating products and services that support a brand – such as the Nike+ products – rather than simply ads.R/GA is also adding capabilities beyond its traditional work, such as consulting services. That strategy will spark creativity by allowing employees to produce cutting-edge work, he says. It will also set the business ahead, he says, because it cannot be commoditised like traditional advertising work.R/GA’s transformation is following the leads of Apple, Google, Amazon and Harvard Business School case studies. The company will be organised into units of 150 workers, for instance, because research says that the cognitive limit for social relationships is about 150 people.Mr Greenberg is also plotting a global expansion. But instead of acquiring companies, R/GA will hire people to start companies from scratch – a strategy to propagate its culture of creativity across the world.“It’s not that we want to do this,” says Mr Greenberg, highlighting how the transition has been a painful one. “We have no choice.”"
356;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-08-21T11:42:21Z;China hit by demands of oversupply;Companies face fight to whittle down inventories;Memories of the London Olympics are already beginning to fade. Li Ning, a Chinese sportswear maker, had better hope that they last a while longer.Like thousands of Chinese companies from property developers to car manufacturers, Li Ning is sitting on a mountain of unsold products. Whether they can whittle down these bulging inventories is the single most important question facing corporate China and arguably the economy as a whole.Many are struggling, but Li Ning at least got timely help from the Olympics when the coolest of the athletes that it sponsored – the hirsute Spanish men’s basketball team and bad-boy badminton champion Lin Dan of China – performed exceptionally well. The hope, of course, is that the boost to its brand image will now translate into stronger sales.Li Ning’s woes are a good parable for the Chinese corporate sector as a whole.Just a few years ago, Li Ning could do no wrong. For investors looking to get a piece of that most enticing of trends, the rise in Chinese consumption, what better than a home-grown sportswear maker that catered to middle-class urbanites discovering the joys of sweating on a treadmill? Or, for those investors keen to play China’s transformation from workshop of the world to creator of big-name brands, what better than a company that deliberately set out to dethrone Adidas and Nike?It was a fine story, and Li Ning did indeed soar. In the stock market, that is. Its share price more than tripled from early 2009 to late 2010.But reality caught up. The Chinese sportswear market was so compelling that Li Ning was far from alone in pursuing it. Aside from the global players, there was a clutch of domestic challengers: Peak, Anta and Xtep, to name just three.The predictable result was massive oversupply. Li Ning’s shares have tumbled 85 per cent from their peak. TPG, the private equity group, and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, came to the rescue earlier this year, buying convertible bonds.Li Ning is belatedly focused on improving inventory management. Previously, it pumped out its shoes and shirts, paying little attention to whether they were actually selling. A new system is now being rolled out so that every time a customer buys something, computers at Li Ning’s headquarters will register the transaction. The idea is that it will know in real time the true state of inventories. But it still has a long way to go.The problems of Li Ning and the sportswear industry are just the tip of the iceberg in China. Across virtually all corporate sectors, inventories are excessive.The stock of unsold homes is the most worrying, because property plays such a dominant role in the economy. Vanke, the country’s biggest developer, estimates that it would take about 10 months to absorb all the unsold homes in China, which is reasonably quick. The snag is that this figure doesn’t count the millions of homes that have been sold but are sitting empty.Then there is the auto sector. Car sales have been remarkably resilient despite the economic slowdown. But manufacturers have been more bullish than consumers. The inventory index (inventories divided by sales) was 1.98 at the end of June, according to industry data. More than 1.5 is seen as critically high.The unsold mountains of electronics and white goods are also looking Himalayan in scale. Over the past week, the country’s main retailers descended into a price war. It began when online retailer 360buy.com vowed that it would sell home appliances at a zero profit margin.The commodities sector is also dealing with a huge inventory overhang, most graphically in the piles of coal that have built up at ports across the country.The picture is not entirely grim. Across most of these sectors, there are signs inventories have peaked. This is one big reason why Chinese retail sales have remained strong but industrial production has slowed in recent months – companies are now running down their inventories.But how long it will take them to complete the process? And will they have to slash prices to get there?There is cause for pessimism on both counts.Destocking is a simple fact of downturns in the business cycle anywhere in the world. What’s different in China is that its downturn is looking structural, not just cyclical: it is very quickly moving from a norm of 10 per cent growth in gross domestic product to less than 8 per cent.Companies had targeted a warp-speed future. It will take them that much longer to adjust to the more sedate reality.Simon Rabinovitch is the FT’s Beijing correspondent
357;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-08-17T18:23:38Z;Witness the fitness;High fashion sport shoes have recently raced back on to the style agenda, especially for men;American swimmer Ryan Lochte, whose Jeremy Scott for Adidas trainers were something of a sideshow during the recent Olympic Games, is not alone in his love of the fancy sneaker. Though the “designer trainer” may sound like a hangover from the late 1990s utilitarian fashion dominated by techno-fabrics and the red Prada Sport stripe, high fashion sport shoes have recently raced back on to the style agenda, especially for men.For autumn/winter Jeremy Scott has created a silver version of the winged trainers (£155), and labels from Acne to Zegna have offered remixes on the classic trainer by cross-breeding it with a brogue (Acne glued air-pumped rubber soles to Chelsea boots, £400) or crafting them from ultra-luxe skins (Céline offers women Vans-inspired loafer trainer hybrids in python). The spring 2013 menswear shows saw Neil Barrett send out slip-on sneakers in bleached ponyskin, while Raf Simons kitted models in techy, elastic-strung sports shoes not a million miles from a Nike Air Max.“In all the collections I have created there has always been the mix of formal and informal, sports and suits,” says Lucas Ossendrijver, head of menswear at Lanvin, which has offered deluxe sneakers in silk-satin and patent leather (£295-£520) for almost a decade. “I have always encouraged breaking with formality. At the time when I put sneakers with suits it was shocking for some. Now it has become accepted.”Stacey Smith, menswear fashion buyer at London’s Matches boutiques, agrees. “I think the divide between formal and casual has become rather arbitrary – when you consider the quality of design, fabrics and finishing in these shoes, they are really on a par with their formal counterparts. And there’s something refreshingly contemporary about a tailored look with running shoes.”Mixing sneakers with suits has become the norm. Pierre Hardy, the French shoe designer who creates styles for labels such as Balenciaga alongside his own brand, says many men have a “wardrobe” of sports shoes to dress up or down. Meeting demand, Hardy offers his signature high-tops in luxurious combinations of velvet and ponyskin as well as sporty neoprenes and perforated leather (£298).According to Anders Sølvsten Thomsen, fashion director of LOVE magazine and avowed trainer aficionado, “Putting a trainer with a dress suit, Nikes with a Prada shirt and Lanvin trousers – gives it a bit of street cred.” Thomsen describes his shoes as “fashion trainers” and differentiates between pairs for sport and daily wear, although he says that New Balance and Nike Air Max (£80-£150) work for both.“Luxury trainers account for a large part of our footwear sales, and it’s an area that continues to grow season on season,” says Stacey Smith, who buys training-shoe styles from the Pierre Hardy collection and labels including Christian Louboutin and Lanvin for Matches.“Over the past few years they have progressed from a niche product to being considered a real staple.” Hardy confirms that 30 per cent of his men’s footwear sales are sneaker styles. (By contrast, trainers make up less than 10 per cent of womenswear sales.)There is an oxymoron about the idea of the designer trainer – as Neil Barrett says, “When Nike does it so well, why buy a designer pair?” But he has an answer: they are “the alternative to the obvious.”
358;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-08-08T18:13:15Z;Olympics’ buzz masks poor state of athletics;;A packed Olympic stadium, cheering crowds, huge global television audiences night after night – track and field is getting its quadrennial moment in the sun.Even the shot putters and hammer throwers, traditionally poor relations to the runners and jumpers, are cheered on, whatever their nationality.But the Olympics, together with the biennial world championships, mask the generally impoverished state of athletics. Set aside its showpiece global events and what is left is a sport struggling for sponsors and broadcasters, participants and a grassroots structure.The earning power of its elite performers, even Usain Bolt, is small compared with their equivalents in other sports.Then there is the chronic lack of personality and charisma from its exponents, with the Jamaican the notable exception. “I don’t think we should kid ourselves. Bolt has a higher appeal than the sport itself,” Lord Coe, Locog chairman, said.One solution would be to rethink track and field along the lines of the short-format concepts that have revived interest in cricket and rugby.The radicals in the normally staid International Amateur Athletics Federation, track and field’s governing body, talk about experiments such as making the high jump a timed event and varying running distances. Craig Masback, a sports marketing executive for Nike, wants more country-versus-country competitions, along the lines of golf’s Ryder Cup.Lord Coe, who is bidding to become the IAAF’s next president, believes the London games have shown it is possible to promote the sport to the uninitiated – the graphics, the musical entertainment, the merchandise. He talks of using social media to reach a younger audience, while respecting the heritage and tradition of athletics.The former Olympic champion also wants the IAAF to be “more hands on” in helping poorer nations promote their star athletes, although the body’s annual revenues of $50m are small compared with the riches of the International Olympic Committee.If he gets the job, Lord Coe’s agenda will be full. The proliferation of mass-running events such as city marathons under the aegis of private bodies has passed it by and now the IAAF wants an active role. It also wants track and field more ingrained in schools.While the UK has been praised by Jacques Rogge, IOC president, for placing sport in the school curriculum, the country’s politicians are also having to explain why school sport is still so underfunded.The multimillion-pound investment into British Olympic athletes is all very well, but “we are trying to grow a tree from the top down”, says former athlete and agent John Bicourt, a contemporary of Lord Coe.Track and field county championships, for example, have been hit hard, he says. “The depth of standard has now gone,” Mr Bicourt adds.Lord Coe recalled a time when Brendan Foster, the former distance runner, would be rung up by Newcastle United football club to check when local athletics meetings were scheduled. “If he was putting on a track meet on a Saturday, Newcastle would move their match to a Friday,” to avoid a clash, Lord Coe said. “We all recognise it’s been tougher for athletics in the last few years.”LeBron James, Basketball, $53mRoger Federer, Tennis, $52.7mKobe Bryant, Basketball, $52.3mMaria Sharapova, Tennis, $27.9mKevin Durant, Basketball, $25.5mCarmelo Anthony, Basketball, $22.9mNovak Djokovic, Tennis, $20.6mUsain Bolt, Athletics, $20.3mLi Na, Tennis, $18.4mDeron Williams, Basketball, $18.2mSource: Forbes(Annual earnings including salary and endorsements, calculated June 2012)

360;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Foxconn: taking manufacturing to Indonesia;;"Foxconn, the Taiwanese company most famous for assembling Apple gadgets, has confirmed that it is looking to open a factory in Indonesia, although it has not yet decided what products will be made there.Taiwanese have for many years been building factories and selling products in southeast Asia, and recent trade data show how the region has become increasingly important as exports to Europe and China begin to slow.“Foxconn is very impressed with the overall investment environment and market potential of Indonesia and that is why we are currently exploring a number of opportunities,” Foxconn Technology Group said in a statement.Last month, Taiwan’s exports to Asean rose 6.1 per cent to $4.43bn, mostly because of growth in mineral and machinery exports, according to Taiwanese government figures.That came as exports to the US, China and Europe fell, sometimes dramatically – exports to the US were down 14 per cent as demand for electronics fell. The only other market to which exports grew was Japan, a smaller market for Taiwan with exports adding up to just $1.54bn.Companies such as Pou Chen, which makes shoes for brands such as Nike, have for many years opened factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, where low-skilled labour is cheaper than Taiwan and China.Bankers and businessmen say that some of those factories, particularly in the technology field, have been less successful and less busy than hoped. Without the component supply chain that’s available in China, logistics are more complicated and expensive, and labour can be harder to find. Foxconn already has a factory in Vietnam but it operates at a far smaller scale than its town-sized operations in China.One Taiwanese economist said local companies, particularly the small ones that dominate the Taiwan corporate landscape, struggle to make sense of cross-border management. Unlike in China, where the language and culture are (to a certain extent) similar to Taiwan’s, in southeast Asia language barriers and managing a workforce from another culture often prove problematic.Nevertheless, southeast Asia remains an obvious destination for manufacturers trying to diversify beyond the mainland, he said.Recent Taiwanese university graduates who have studied Vietnamese are being recruited at salaries of T$45,000 a month ($1,496) plus benefits by Taiwanese enterprises there, said Chern Jyh-wen, director of the East Asian language department at National University of Kaohsiung in south Taiwan. That, he said, is better than many masters’ students get.Additional reporting by Jason CH LiuRelated reading:

361;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-07-20T18:16:54Z;Racing for the bottom line;The commercial aspect of the modern Olympics dictates that every country tries to wring as much as possible out of it;"One of the weirder aspects of the upcoming Olympic Games, fashionably speaking, has not been the deconstructed Union flag designs Stella McCartney (see Lunch with the FT) and Adidas unveiled for Team GB, nor the recent hoo-ha created by politicians over the fact Ralph Lauren’s Team USA outfits are not made in the USA, but the almost total absence of Next from the conversation.The British high-street brand is the official outfitter of Team GB for the opening and closing ceremonies, only no one seems to know it. Unlike McCartney and Adidas, as well as many of their competitors who have unveiled their outfits, the Next folks have chosen not to reveal their looks until the athletes march into the stadium on Friday.Presumably the thinking is that this prolongs the anticipation but, given the noise everyone else has made about their contribution to the Olympic runway, and given the fact that Next is not exactly known for either its high-performance athletic wear or high-fashion sensibility, I’m not sure the strategy has worked, other than to obscure their part in the event. It’s all a little confusing.But perhaps this is because fashion’s involvement in the Olympics is itself increasingly confused. I mean, think about it: when it comes to the US, Lauren is making the outfits for both general ceremonies and hanging about in the athletes’ village, though Nike is doing a lot of the competitive gear (it’s a bit sport-by-sport; Ariat, for example, is outfitting the US equestrian team). When it comes to the UK, McCartney is doing the competitive gear and the village wear but not the ceremonial clothes. For Italy, Armani is doing most of the above, except Prada is doing the sailing team – and so on. Which doesn’t even explore the image/aspiration gap between names like the above and Hudson’s Bay, which is dressing the Canadian team, or sporting goods company Bogner, which is dressing Germany.My guess is most consumers, hearing a name they recognise (Armani, Ralph Lauren) immediately, and wrongly, assume everything they see has been created by said name. The problem lies in the gap between the ideals of the Olympics, the celebrity of fashion, and the reality of a modern global sports and media event. The former would lead the romantic among us (OK, me) to assume that a country would like its best sportsmen dressed by its best stylemen, because (a) both represent the same nation; (b) the better you look, generally, the better you feel, which means the better you perform; and (c) fashion designers have developed a pop culture fame of their own, which brings a halo effect of glamour to the event.And it makes sense for designers to want to dress the athletes, because it’s a logical next step in the brand extension game.…The commercial aspect of the modern Olympics, however, dictates that every country tries to wring as much as possible, financially, out of said event. And fashion has been one of the few industries still doing well in the past few years. Which means designers don’t just make the Olympic kit but, in many cases, it costs them significant amounts to do so.And that means not only is there a fee involved but sometimes the design house has to absorb the production cost of hundreds, if not thousands, of specialised outfits, an outlay that demands real financial muscle. While individual Olympic committees sometimes buy these outfits from the designer, this varies from country to country, and can often result in a loss for the brand.Even allowing for the fact that the design names can then showcase these Olympic outfits in their stores, tempting the general public into buying a bit of that Olympic gold dust for themselves, there are only a few fashion names that can support the initial outlay and even they can’t necessarily carry all of it. No country wants to admit that when it comes to how its athletes are dressed, the choice is less who might be that country’s best designer than who can afford it, just as no designer wants to admit they bought their way into the job.Now, I’m sure the fashion people will also have to have pitched some sort of suitable design idea – I’m not saying it’s all about filthy lucre – but I wonder what the ratio is. Especially because it changes from country to country, and sometimes sport to sport. After numerous conversations with the various parties involved, from Olympic committees to fashion brands, I still don’t understand how it works. And I’m pretty sure the average spectator or viewer doesn’t either.Which makes me wonder if it wouldn’t behove everyone involved to be either completely transparent about the relationship – who paid what for what rights – or desist altogether, levelling the playing field, so to speak, by having every country wear pretty much the same, albeit in different colours.Because right now, I’m not sure who in this situation, other than maybe the various Olympic committees, really wins.vanessa.friedman@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/friedman"
362;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-07-18T14:55:15Z;Puma – down at heel;Investors should look to the stands, not the field, to explain profit warning;Puma should be enjoying its summer of sport – cat logo-clad Italian footballers reached the final of Euro 2012, while Usain Bolt will wear the company’s kit when he competes in the 100m at the Olympic Games. But instead of having fun, the sporting goods group has served up a profit warning – net earnings for the first half of 2012 will be 13 per cent below the €115m reported for the same period last year. The company will also take a €100m restructuring charge. Investors might well wonder what is going on.The culprit is not on the sporting field (despite Italy’s drubbing by Adidas-wearing Spain in the football) but in the stands. Puma’s revival over the past decade has been driven by its popularity with fashion-conscious youngsters. So it is not helpful that youth unemployment in the eurozone is up from 15 per cent in 2007 to 22 per cent now. Puma generates 45 per cent of sales from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, so the fall in spending power hurts, as does growing competition in the sports lifestyle market. The company is also damaged by its reliance on shoes, which account for about half of sales. According to data from Euromonitor, sports footwear will underperform sports clothing in western Europe this year.Puma is not alone. Nike missed its earnings forecasts in June, blaming rising costs as well as the European economy. Shares in both have been slow out of the blocks this year, down 5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Adidas has been stronger, but all eyes will be on its first-half results early in August.As for Puma, its shares fell 5 per cent in response to Wednesday’s announcement. That is less harsh than might be expected, reflecting the possibility that 80 per cent shareholder PPR could bid for the rest. As the Olympics get under way, Puma shareholders should focus on the action away from the track.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Sales increased 8.8 per cent in that period.Worried European consumers are trimming spending in Europe causing problems for retailers and consumer goods companies. Fourth-quarter profit at Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear group by sales, declined unexpectedly after it reported weaker demand in Europe and China, the US company said last month.Metro, the German cash-and-carry group, was among several retailers to caution about a tougher European environment in recent days.However, Puma’s warning still surprised the market as sports goods companies tend to enjoy a sales boost around the time of popular sporting events, even though these are also associated with higher marketing expenses.Last month Europeans were glued to the European football championships and next week the Olympics begin in London. Usain Bolt, the sprinter expected to be one of the stars of the games, is contracted to Puma. Rival Adidas is an official sponsor of the games.The timing of the announcement is a blow for Franz Koch, 33, who took over as chief executive last summer from Jochen Zeitz, who led Puma for 18 years.Mr Koch has put a greater strategic focus on sports performance after a long period when Puma put more emphasis on the fashion-conscious customer.Mr Koch told the Financial Times in February that be believed company was relatively protected from austerity in Europe. “There is something special to our industry – sports goods do not seem so affected by the crisis,” he said at the time.Andreas Inderst at Exane BNP Paribas told clients he believed Puma’s warning was “mainly due to company-specific weakness” such as unsatisfactory product innovation and too-high inventories.“We expect a much better performance from Adidas,” Mr Inderst added, referring to Puma’s local rival.Puma said it plans to accelerate and expand a cost-cutting programme that will trigger €100m in one-time costs.Its full-year net sales are now expected to grow by a mid-single digit percentage, compared with previous expectations of a high-single digit rate.Full-year net profit is expected to “decrease significantly” from last year’s €230m due in part to the cost-cutting charges.The stock closed 4.8 per cent lower at €214.65 in Frankfurt. Puma is set to publish full first-half results on 26 July.
365;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-06-29T21:03:51Z;US equities gain impetus from EU action;;Wall Street stocks enjoyed their best one-day rise this year, bolstered by optimism that European leaders are taking action that addresses eurozone sovereign debt troubles.Stocks surged in what was a broad-based rally as many investors had been expecting no definitive action at the two-day EU summit that ended on Friday.“The agreement by the European leaders showed that the leadership finally began to understand that capital markets are much more demanding in much less time nowadays,” said Quincy Krosby, financial market strategist at Prudential.The S&P 500 closed up 2.5 per cent on Friday for a gain of 2.03 per cent on the week to 1,362.15 points. The rally this week has propelled the benchmark index to its first positive monthly gain of 4 per cent since March and the best June performance since 1999. That leaves the S&P higher by 8.3 per cent so far this year.Analysts said the market’s strong performance was also a function of the final trading day for June and the second quarter, with investors buying stocks in order to bolster their portfolio returns.“Another aspect of [Friday’s] rallying markets has to do with the fact that it’s the end of the quarter and the first half year,” said Ms Krosby. “Managers are trying to enhance the performance of their portfolios,” she added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 2.2 per cent gaining 1.9 per cent over the week to 12,880.09. The Nasdaq Composite index also jumped 3 per cent to 2,935.05 and registered a 1.5 per cent gain for the week.US stocks shrugged off weak economic data on Friday, with consumer spending flat and incomes ticking up a meagre 0.1 per cent.Industrials and energy stocks were boosted by soaring oil prices on the back of the EU deal to help Spain and Italy recapitalise their banks and bring down bond yields.The S&P energy index was the best performing sector this week with a gain of 4.2 per cent.Among big winners this week were the oil and gas drillers Newfield Exploration and Pioneer Natural Resources. Newfield Exploration was 11.5 per cent higher on the week to $29.31, while Pioneer climbed 5.6 per cent over the week to $88.21.Financials also rose sharply on Friday, enabling the S&P sector to gain 1.7 per cent over the week. Major US banks were bolstered by the news that European banks will be stabilised after EU leaders took steps to creating a banking union.Citigroup rallied on Friday but fell 2.7 per cent over the week to $27.41. Bank of America rose 1.8 per cent to $8.18 and Wells Fargo added 1.4 per cent to $33.44 this week. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase fell 0.9 per cent this week to $35.73 as investors priced in larger losses from its credit derivatives activities.The S&P technology sector lagged behind others to register a 0.5 per cent rise on the week.One of the biggest gainers in the tech sector was Oracle, up 5 per cent to $29.70 this week. Another notable gainer was Amazon, up 2.6 per cent over the week to $228.35.In corporate deal news, Constellation Brands gained 39.5 per cent to $27.06 after the world’s largest wine company agreed to buy the other half of its Crown Imports joint venture with Grupo Modelo. The deal would turn Constellation Brands into the sole US importer of top-selling Corona beers.Anheuser-Busch InBev also ticked up a weekly gain of 12.6 per cent to $79.65 after agreeing to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo for about $20.1bn. The world’s largest brewer by sales gained 3 per cent over the week.Among the biggest losers, Research In Motion shares fell 24.6 per cent over the week to $7.39 following first-quarter results showing profit declines. Investors were also disappointed to learn that the launch of the BlackBerry 10 smartphone had been pushed back to early next year.In other corporate earnings news, Ford shares fell 6.7 per cent this week to $9.59 after the US’s second-largest carmaker pre-announced quarterly results, warning that its pre-tax profits would be “substantially lower” as revenues were hit in Europe, South America and Asia.Nike’s earnings results came in lower than expected on Thursday after the market close. The sports goods maker’s shares fell 11 per cent to $87.75 this week.KB Home announced a loss which was narrower than anticipated. The stock climbed 19.66 per cent over the past week to $9.80, with most of the gains coming on Friday.Coty, the cosmetics group, has filed for an initial public offering on Friday in an attempt to raise about $700m.
366;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Rising costs and slowdown hit Nike profits;;Nike’s fourth-quarter profit fell unexpectedly as new product launches and sporting events such as the upcoming Olympics failed to offset a rise in costs and slowdowns in Europe and China.The results triggered a 13 per cent fall in Nike shares in after-hours trading on Thursday to $84.40.The US sportswear group reported an 8 per cent decline in net income for the three months ended May 31 from a year earlier to $549m or $1.17 cents a share. This fell short of consensus forecasts of quarterly earnings of $1.37 for the quarter.Total revenues increased 12 per cent to $6.5bn, falling slightly below expectations.But total sales and administrative expenses also rose 12 per cent to $2bn, due to high product costs, an increase in the effective tax rate and increased marketing expenses surrounding the Euro 2012 football competition and the London Olympics. The latest period included a $24m restructuring charge related to the group’s western European operations.Mark Parker, chief executive, said the group delivered “solid profit growth for the year despite some headwinds in a challenging global economy”.He said he expected “persistent challenges into 2013”, including commodities and labour costs, currency pressure, especially in Europe, and slower growth in China.In the fourth quarter, gross margins at the Oregon-based group fell 1.5 percentage points to 42.8 per cent, marking the sixth straight quarterly fall.Margins were also affected by higher spending on the group’s digital business and a customs assessment in an emerging market that the company did not name. It said the cost was related to imports during the past four fiscal years.For the full year, Nike reported a 4 per cent rise in net income and a 16 per cent rise in total revenues. Total expenses, however, rose 11 per cent.Nike this year warned that inventories were higher than planned in some markets – notably apparel in Europe and China – leading to questions about whether it would need to discount more merchandise than expected. As of May 31, inventories were up 23 per cent from a year earlier.Future orders, a key measure for the group, rose 7 per cent compared with a year ago.In May, Nike announced plans to exit from its Cole Haan and Umbro brands, its first planned divestitures in about four years, as the company aimed to focus on its Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. Cole Haan and Umbro contributed $797m to the top line in 2012.By category, footwear and apparel sales jumped 12 per cent and 10 per cent for the quarter, while the equipment unit saw a 20 per cent rise.Ahead of its results Nike shares ended regular trading at $96.89, down 1.2 per cent.
367;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-06-25T20:59:02Z;US stocks fall on earnings uncertainty;;Research In Motion fell after Morgan Stanley said in a report that the BlackBerry maker is likely to miss estimates for its second-quarter earnings.RIM’s shares sank 7.6 per cent to $9.11. The bank downgraded them to “sell” with a target price of $7.Market share loss for the company would accelerate as “competition increases in emerging markets due to increased availability and lower price points of Android smartphones”, said Ehud Gelblum, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.James Moorman, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, also maintained the “sell” rating for the company with a 12-month target price of $9.50. Shares in RIM have plunged 37.2 per cent in the year to date.US equities were sharply lower on Monday, led by energy and financial sectors. Investors were unsettled by the eurozone crisis and by the potential impact of slowing global economy on US companies ahead of the second-quarter earnings season.The S&P 500 fell 1.6 per cent to 1,313.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1 per cent to 12,502.66, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2 per cent to 2,836.16.All 10 S&P 500 sectors traded in negative territory. The energy sector was among the top declining groups, which was 1.9 per cent lower as oil prices extended their recent downward trend.Chesapeake was one of the laggards on Monday, falling 8.5 per cent to $17.03. The US gas producer, which was questioned by its largest shareholder on corporate governance matters, had appointed Archie Dunham as its new chairman.US solar panel maker First Solar pared last Friday’s gains, losing 4.3 per cent to $15.20, while WPX Energy declined 3.5 per cent to $14.70.“We still believe the global equity markets will trace out a very choppy advance during the second half of the year,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, which projects a 12-month target for the S&P 500 of 1,450.“As a result, we think investors will be willing to make only short-term investment commitments as uncertainties surrounding the European debt crisis, depth of European recession, Chinese economic landing parameters and their impact on US economic growth expectations [persist].”The financial sector, which dropped 2.1 per cent on Monday, was one of the worst-performing sectors.Citigroup was down 4.4 per cent to $26.75, Morgan Stanley slipped 4.7 per cent to $13.48, Bank of America declined 4.3 per cent to $7.60 and JPMorgan Chase moved 1.9 per cent lower to $35.32.Shares in Wells Fargo fell 1.8 per cent to $32.23. The mortgage lender said on Monday that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire the subscription finance portfolio of Germany’s WestLB.Technology stocks lost momentum. Google, whose Android mobile phone system continues to gain market share, was down 1.9 per cent to $560.70.Microsoft, which had lately unveiled its new tablet Surface to compete with Apple’s iPad, traded 2.7 per cent lower to $29.87. The software company announced on Monday it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yammer, the corporate social networking tool, for $1.2bn cash.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in both the Nasdaq and S&P, decreased 2 per cent to $570.77. Facebook lost 3 per cent to $32.06.Zynga, the social network game development company that relies on Facebook to generate revenue, was up 1.2 per cent to $6.01. The company, which has invited media and analysts to its event “Zynga Unleashed” on Tuesday in San Francisco, is expected to improve its business outside of Facebook.But Quest Software rose 5.6 per cent to $27.70. The technology company is in the middle of a takeover plan by a “strategic bidder”, according to its statement issued earlier. A Reuters report quoted a source saying that one of the bidders is Dell. Shares in Dell dropped 2.1 per cent to $11.95.Elsewhere, shares in Walmart increased 1.3 per cent to $68.18. The multinational retailer said in a statement that the company is adding new stores in Canada.Nike dropped 2 per cent to $97.46. Camilo Lyon, an analyst at Canaccord, repeated a “hold” rating as it forecast decelerating orders for the sportswear manufacturer.Investors were also focusing on weaker earnings guidance after FedEx, Bed Bath & Beyond and Procter & Gamble issued warnings last week.David Shairp, a global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “Corporate earnings momentum has been an area of strength in the current environment. Over the last few weeks, however, high-frequency data on sell-side analysts’ earnings estimates has started to fall precipitously.“Our ominous feeling going into reporting is further supported by a spike in the number of so-called company ‘negative earnings pre-announcements’.”
368;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-06-20T14:37:58Z;WPP to buy digital agency AKQA for $540m;;WPP has agreed to buy AKQA for about $540m, adding one of the largest and most highly regarded independent digital agencies to the world’s largest advertising and marketing group by revenue.The deal, announced as the industry gathered in the south of France for the annual Cannes Lions awards, was seen as a strategic coup for Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive officer.AKQA has built a reputation for creativity and innovative uses of social media, mobile, gaming and other digital tools that are transforming marketing.However, the deal breaks through WPP’s total acquisition budget for the year of £400m, which Sir Martin reaffirmed as recently as April.“I’m not pretending it’s cheap. Nothing good comes easy and nothing good comes cheap,” Sir Martin told the Financial Times. But he added that the enterprise value of about $540m would meet WPP’s 6.1 per cent cost of capital and be accretive to earnings in year one.AKQA is widely seen as the largest remaining independent digital agency after a series of acquisitions of digital specialists by large marketing holding companies.The deal, subject to regulatory approval, was “bang in line” with WPP’s strategy of deriving 35 to 40 per cent of its business from direct, digital and interactive revenues, Sir Martin said.Founded in 2001, AKQA had gross assets of $282m at the end of 2011 and expects revenues of about $230m in 2012, after sales reached $189m in 2011.It has 1,160 staff in offices from San Francisco to Shanghai, but most of its revenues come from the US and Western Europe. Clients include Nike, Gap and Microsoft Xbox.Several potential bidders last year approached General Atlantic, which has owned a majority stake in AKQA since 2007, people familiar with the discussions said at the time, with one saying Dentsu of Japan had offered more than $550m and another challenging that figure.Morgan Stanley had been working with General Atlantic on the expressions of interest and on the possible alternative of an initial public offering of AKQA at some point in the next few years.“We’ve been approached by every major holding company and also other organisations,” said AKQA founder and chairman Ajaz Ahmed, who will continue to operate the agency with chief executive Tom Bedecarré as “an independent and standalone brand” within WPP. “WPP have this extraordinary ambition and vision that we really connect with.”Mr Ahmed founded AKQA in London in 1995 before merging it with Mr Bedecarré’s San Francisco-based agency in 2001.He said that the agency’s success came from “applying that Silicon Valley optimism and innovative spirit to a UK company . . . It’s something we are tremendously proud of. There are so many agencies that went to the wall in the dotcom crash.”He said the deal was something he intended to “commit to for over a decade” as AKQA expanded into new countries.“The timing was right because we’d reached the point where for us to go and have a broader service offering and geographic offering, it made sense to partner with WPP,” Mr Bedecarré added.Mr Bedecarré will also become president of WPP Ventures, a newly formed company in Silicon Valley. The new unit would bring the group’s clients closer to established digital groups such as Facebook, Google and Twitter and to the next generation of start-ups, Mr Bedecarré said.WPP lauded AKQA’s “reputation as the one to watch” as it highlighted the 19 “agency of the year” titles it has won and the five Cannes Lions awards it collected last year.The Gunn Report, which assesses agencies and campaigns, said in February that AKQA in London ranked equally with BBH and R/GA in New York as the “most awarded” digital agency in 2011.“This is not about cost synergies. This is about revenue opportunities,” Sir Martin said. “AKQA adds another arrow to our quiver. Maybe the analogy should be another bazooka to our quiver.”
369;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-06-19T23:00:41Z;Rooney tweet falls foul of ad watchdog;;England footballers Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have been forced to delete postings to Twitter after the advertising watchdog found they failed to declare their sponsorship by Nike.The complaint is the first to be upheld against Twitter activity involving advertisers since the Advertising Standards Authority assumed new powers to regulate social media last year.The ruling follows an ASA investigation into Twitter posts by celebrities including Rio Ferdinand which promoted Snickers but were found not to be in breach of the advertising code.The US Federal Trade Commission, which introduced similar guidelines in 2009, has brought two endorsement-related cases involving social media, against a PR firm for video game developers and a company selling guitar lessons – but none involving a brand as prominent as Nike.Both the footballers’ tweets were posted in January, highlighting the challenge for regulators in responding quickly to a fast-paced medium such as Twitter.Wayne Rooney told his millions of followers: “My resolution – to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion …#makeitcount.gonike.me/makeitcount”Jack Wilshere’s read: “In 2012, I will come back for my club – and be ready for my country #makeitcount.gonike.me/Makeitcount”.An unidentified complainant contacted the ASA asking whether the tweets were “obviously identifiable as marketing communications”.In its response, Nike argued that the tweets “should be viewed in the context in which they appeared” because Twitter is “a more direct channel of communication between two parties, than traditional media”, according to the ASA’s report.Nike added that both players were “well known for being sponsored by Nike” and that therefore, their followers “would not be misled about the relationship between the footballers and Nike”. Additionally, the web address in the tweets referred to Nike.However, the ASA upheld the complaint.“We considered that the Nike reference was not prominent and could be missed, consumers would not have already been aware of Nike’s #makeitcount campaign and that not all Twitter users would be aware of the footballers’ and their teams’ sponsorship deal with Nike” it said. “We considered there was nothing obvious in the tweets to indicate they were Nike marketing communications.“The ads must no longer appear. We told Nike to ensure that its advertising was obviously identifiable as such.”The ASA suggested that future sponsored posts should include an identifier such as #ad.Additional reporting by Emily Steel in New York
370;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-06-14T21:59:43Z;Can your brand win with social media?;;"Any brand worth its salt is trying to figure out how to engage and activate consumers via social media. Those that are not focused on building capabilities in this area are, at their peril, ignoring one of the most important global developments in media, marketing, and technology today.Most companies recognise this: 96 per cent are developing a specific strategy for social media, and 95 per cent expect to spend more on social media in the coming year, according to our research. With everyone jumping into the social media conversation, what makes companies stand out and helps them connect their brands to consumers more distinctively than their competition?It certainly takes more than ‘likes,’ ‘followers,’ and ‘views’ on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. A 2011 study of 117 leading companies conducted by Booz & Company with social enterprise software provider Buddy Media, found that companies such as Burberry, Diageo, and Nike are focusing on three new capabilities that will enable them to excel in social media. In doing so, they are fundamentally transforming their marketing, as well as other functions including customer service, research, sales, and product development.The first capability is community management, the mastery of convening, hosting, and serving fans. A cosmetics brand manager compared social marketing to hosting a party: “It takes planning, effort, and an appealing environment where guests feel welcome and engaged.” Brands can not just invite fans in; they have to listen to them and reward their behavior with a responsive, interesting, valuable, and attentive social experience. They have to do all this in real time while reinforcing the brand’s positioning, the unique brand voice, and the company’s business objectives.Like a great dinner party host, community managers need to excel at conversation, interaction, curation, and listening. As they are the core orchestrators of brand-to-user connectivity, companies must resist the temptation to outsource this capability, and instead follow Starwood Hotels and Resorts’ example.Starwood identified a dedicated community management role that the company nicknamed ‘the Lurker’: part brand champion, part chief listener, this customer service professional engaged customers on travel forums, answering questions and resolving issues. This role has since evolved into a dedicated team monitoring social channels in real time and delivering high-quality, personalised service experiences that have translated into higher guest satisfaction for Starwood - guests who are more likely to return and to recommend a stay to their friends.Next is content development, the ability to create authentic, participatory, and sharable content (in multiple formats) that builds an active connection between a brand and its fan community. “The most compelling stories are told by brands that use the inherent properties of social media to do something [they] cannot do in other media,” says Ajaz Ahmed, chairman and founder of AKQA, one of the world’s leading digital advertising agencies. “With Twitter, that means immediacy. With Facebook, it means making a creative, inspiring, and useful contribution to the community.”In expanding their social media efforts, marketers need more of the “publisher” mind-set as they compete for fans’ attention and loyalty with more owned and earned media. This spurs a need for more creative resources and content; already, among companies planning to hire social media talent within the year, 72 per cent are prioritising producers and editors above all other needs.Burberry stands out as a brand that has become a social content powerhouse. In 2011 it streamed a live video feed of its spring/summer and fall/winter shows, sharing its unique content with millions of fans and interested consumers on Facebook and YouTube. Similarly, it premiered an ad for its fragrance ‘Body’ on Burberry.com and YouTube - not TV. Social media, as a result, has significantly reduced Burberry’s dependence on traditional media, especially print.Finally, marketers need to have real-time analytics capabilities to assess the impact of social media efforts, and confirm they are on target. Our research indicates there are four levels to a real-time analytics capability, with increasing levels of sophistication: reach, engagement, advocacy, and return on investment.Only 40 percent of companies currently have the metrics in place to measure ROI-focused indicators such as purchase intent, leads generated, and conversion rates, but brands must move in this direction. In addition to the ability to measure business outcomes, social media represents an enormous opportunity to gather unfiltered consumer insights that can be leveraged in advertising, customer service, and product development.Dell is a brand that is realising this value today. The company relentlessly analyses the connection between social media engagement and revenue generated in physical as well as online stores, which helps its executives understand how social media impacts loyalty, product innovation, brand favorability, and even costs (such as the cost of customer support).Companies are awakening to the broader, enterprise-wide value of social media. Although today two-thirds of the 117 companies we studied dedicate 5 per cent or less of their digital marketing spend to social media, within the next three years, more than half expect to spend 10 per cent or more, and one-quarter expect social media spending to exceed 20 per cent.To maximise the value of this increased spend, companies will need to move beyond experimentation and transform their capabilities in community management, content development, and real-time analytics. This focus on capabilities will enable them to deliver a distinctive, repeatable social media outcome that both elevates their brand and strengthens their bottom line.Christopher Vollmer is a partner with Booz & Company leading the firm’s global media and entertainment practice.

371;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike to divest Umbro and Cole Haan brands;;Nike, the US sportswear group, said on Thursday that it would divest its Umbro and Cole Haan brands in an effort to focus on its core brand and other faster-growing business lines.“Divesting of Umbro and Cole Haan will allow us to focus our resources on the highest-potential opportunities for Nike Inc to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders,” said Mark Parker, Nike chief executive.Umbro, the UK-based football brand, sponsors the England team kit and its diamond logo appears on sportswear around the world. Nike took Umbro private in 2008 for £285m, as the Oregon-based company sought to increase its football revenues, which it said at the time had reached $1.5bn annually.However, Umbro failed to perform under Nike. Revenues of $276m in 2006 fell to $224m last year. Nike did not indicate if it would seek to relist Umbro or sell it.In 2009, Nike wrote down $400m based on Umbro’s declining goodwill, a move that helped the company achieve a lower effective tax rate for the year.“Although Umbro’s financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition,” the company said in last year’s annual report.“This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business.”Cole Haan had revenues of $518m last fiscal year, a 12 per cent rise from the previous year. It operates 190 stores worldwide, with a majority of them in the US, including a flagship location in New York City’s Rockefeller Center.The sale or spin-off of Cole Haan and Umbro will mark the second recent bout of deal activity in the footwear business. In May Collective Brands, the group behind Payless ShoeSource and Sperry Top-Sider split itself up.Nike said the divestitures would allow it to focus on its core brands.“We see tremendous opportunity to accelerate profitable growth around the world by continuing to deliver innovation and inspire consumers through the Nike brand,” said Mr Parker. “We also see significant potential in Jordan, Converse and Hurley, which have unique consumer relationships that complement the Nike Brand.”Nike revenues were $20.8bn last year, up from $16.3bn in 2007.
372;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-05-15T17:09:28Z;Going for sportswear gold;A tri-wear group is aiming to become Australia’s first global sportswear brand, writes Neil Hume;"Aidan Clarke is itching to reveal 2XU’s most extraordinary endorsement. But the 40-year-old co-founder of the Australian sportswear company can’t. It’s “classified information”, he jokes.“You can certainly say US military operatives are wearing 2XU, including the Navy Seals and the Army Rangers, but we’ve been warned against referring to any specific tactical groups,” he says.It is an issue the company, which aims to be a global sportswear brand, has faced many times since it was founded in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn in 2005.“Turn to page 53 and see what he’s wearing,” urges Mr Clarke, pushing the April edition of ESPN The Magazine across the table. The “he” is LeBron James, the basketball star whose legs are clad in a pair of 2XU-branded compression tights, which retail for as much as A$185 ($185). “He’s got a multi­million-dollar Nike contract and look what’s he’s got on,” continues Mr Clarke, who claims there are many other elite athletes wearing 2XU’s range of performance-enhancing tights, shorts, tri-suits and calf-guards. 2XU – Two Times You – denotes “multiply your performance”, he explains.Mr Clarke can reel off a long list of NBA and American football teams that have bought 2XU branded garments for players to wear under their uniforms, including the Los Angeles Clippers, the New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, the New York Jets and New York Giants.Such deals along with alliances with sporting bodies such as Swimming Australia and the PGA of Australia have helped 2XU increase sales at an annual compound rate of 40 per cent over the past four years and carve a profitable niche in sportswear. The company was recently valued at more than A$100m in a round of private equity funding and expects profits of A$10m on sales of A$40m in the year to July 2012.Clyde Davenport founded 2XU in 2005. The 57-year-old former advertising executive had just sold his eponymously named upmarket underwear business for A$15m and says he had no desire to get back into apparel. But then he met Mr Clarke and Jamie Hunt, a 40-year-old former professional triathlete, who had been working for Orca, a New Zealand company that makes wetsuits for triathletes. They wanted to start their own high-performance sportswear business. “I saw in them the person I was 17 years earlier,” says Mr Davenport. So he threw his lot in with the two Kiwis, providing years of expertise and several million dollars in seed funding.The initial strategy was to position 2XU as a “technical performance” brand focused on triathlon. The foun­ders thought this was a market they could dominate relatively quickly because it had been ignored by the big brands. They would then use it as a platform to push into other categories such as running and cycling.But that changed as Mr Davenport became interested in compression sportswear, which proponents claim helps reduce muscle damage and speeds up recovery after strenuous exercise by stimulating blood flow. At that time, only one other Australian business called Skins was focused on compression and Mr Davenport thought he could do a better job. “We had the knowledge and ability to develop a far superior product and . . . We all knew, especially Jamie, the importance of improving performance and recovery for elite athletes.”Do:

Remember that if it was easy everyone would be doing it, so push through the barriers and naysayers.Don’t:
Produce a product exactly like everyone else – marketing differentiation is difficult and you become commoditised to price point.
Forget your brand personality and what you stand for – ensure you deliver it consistently and make sure the experience matches the brand promises.An early big break for 2XU came when Triathalon Australia, the sport’s governing body, asked it to provide suits for the 2005 World Championships in Gamagori, Japan. “The elite coaches at the time had been let down. But they knew Jamie and Aidan could make a tri-suit because of their time at Orca,” says Mr Davenport. The Australian team went on to dominate the championships, taking gold medals in the main men’s and women’s events, which opened doors with buyers as Mr Clarke hit the road with the first collection. “Our kit was on the front page of every tri magazine,” he says.He hopes for similar success at the London 2012 paralympics, where 2XU is providing the Australian team’s kit.What has really helped create a buzz around the brand has been the relationship between 2XU and the Australian Institute of Sport, the government-backed national training body, that dates back to 2005. 2XU now funds research in the AIS’s recovery division whose sole aim is to test the designs and fabrics that Mr Hunt, dir­ector of product development and company’s technical brains, sources from mills in Europe and Asia. He explains that most of the clothes are made in China, not because it is cheaper but because the factories have the best sewing and cutting machines.This relationship also means the company is able to back up its “performing enhancing” claims with quantitative data which is a big selling point. The founders cite one test the AIS carried out on a dozen top cyclists. “The guys that were not wearing 2XU during the recovery had an almost 2 per cent drop-off in aerobic capacity. But those who wore 2XU came back within 0.1 per cent of their aerobic capacity, and with a lower heart rate,” says Mr Clarke. In professional sports, even such small margins can make the difference between first and fourth.The challenge now is to take the business from “the locker room to the mass market” without the marketing firepower of a Nike or Adidas, and without damaging the brand. In order to hit its A$100m short-term revenue target, Mr Davenport says they will have to explain to weekend golfers why they need an A$50 pair of compression socks and to convince women that its A$110 high-impact sports bra is really worth the money. “The biggest issue we have now is explaining what our product can do. Otherwise it is just a very expensive top, sock or bra,” he says. To that end, 2XU sold a “significant minority equity” stake to the Australian private equity arm of investment bank Lazard last November, which al­lowed the company to acquire its US distributor and start work on two flagship performance centres – what it terms “experiential retail” – on the west coast.But if it is to fulfil its ambitions to become a company with A$1bn of sales, it will need to add more distributors – 2XU is in 40 countries so far – and expand ranges, as well developing e-commerce and social media. Mr Clarke is optimistic. “If you look at some of the start-ups that have got to A$1bn of sales in the past 10 years, Lululemon [the yoga clothing label] for example, we are tracking them.”"
373;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-05-09T18:10:00Z;Fleet-footed groups can outrun the critics;Nike provides a timeline of how companies attempt to build a decent reputation;The first thing I notice about the running shoe that Hannah Jones, Nike’s head of sustainability and innovation, plops on the table is that it is full of holes. The second is how light it is.Very impressive, I say of the yellow-green and black shoe’s weight, but, with all the (deliberate) holes in its knitted upper, it probably doesn’t keep the rain out. It doesn’t keep the rain in either, she responds. More important, while running-shoe uppers usually have 20 to 30 stitched pieces, this one is made from a single thread. That reduces manufacturing costs and cuts waste. The shoe, the Nike Flyknit, is the latest phase in the US company’s effort to be seen as a responsible business.Nike has experience of being seen as the opposite. It was one of the first companies to face accusations of exploiting sweatshop labour. The allegations started in the 1990s and they have not gone away. Last year, workers making Nike’s Converse footwear at contractors’ factories in Indonesia complained of abusive behaviour by their supervisors.Because Nike drew the first fire, it also has the longest experience of deflecting it – and its progress provides a timeline of how companies attempt to create a decent reputation for themselves.The oldest form of corporate responsibility is philanthropy – often donations to local causes. Companies justified it to their shareholders by saying that stable communities made for healthier businesses and that the recipients of the generosity would stand by the company in tough times. It did not always work: Enron’s lavish funding of Houston projects counted for nothing when the company stood accused of fraud.Corporate responsibility’s second incarnation was as reputation defence: companies scanned the horizon (and later the web) for potentially damaging criticism. Nike became expert at this when it was targeted by the anti-sweatshop campaigners. The problem, Ms Jones says, is it doesn’t always work either. Nike’s sportswear is made by 1m workers in 900 factories owned by other companies. You can inspect them but that does not eliminate what she calls the “yo-yo effect”. Factories make things look good during inspections and then revert to what they were doing before.Realising that it could never eliminate all abuses on its own, in 2005 Nike published its factory locations online. The message was clear. To activists, the company was saying: go and find problems and we will deal with them. To other manufacturers, the message was: these factories are producing your goods as well as ours. We are all in this together.Nike says that not all problems are the factories’ fault. It causes some itself. One of the most persistent abuses is factories forcing workers to put in 72-hour weeks or 14 days without a break. When Nike investigated, it found that 68 per cent of cases of excessive overtime resulted from increased output it had demanded. This frank admission is in Nike’s recent “Sustainable Business Performance Summary”.Sustainability: that was responsible business’s third phase, as companies discovered that reducing packaging, squeezing more goods into each truck and cutting electricity costs all helped them look green and boosted margins. As Nike points out, however, it is not just about cost-cutting. With energy prices high and water scarce, the company needs to “decouple our profitable growth from constrained resources”, Mark Parker, Nike’s chief executive, says in the report. “The age of abundance is over.”Ms Jones argues that the one-thread shoe is a way of going beyond sustainability – to innovation. Nike is not alone in using energy and resource efficiency as a spur to devising new products. Unilever did the same with its concentrated detergent. But Nike is now trying to innovate in its labour relations too. Does clothing and footwear manufacturing have to be “an inherently low-tech, low-skill and low-wage job”? Could the principles of lean manufacturing pioneered in the motor industry – higher paid, higher skilled, more efficient in its use of materials – work in Nike’s business? It has been training its contractors in lean manufacturing and also asking them another question: if you had more efficient workers, could you pay them more and still maintain your profitability?Nike still gets plenty wrong, but this sort of innovation, if it works, could be responsible business’s fourth, and most fruitful, incarnation.michael.skapinker@ft.com

That is the treatment investors gave Adidas on Monday. In a preliminary first-quarter results announcement the German sports goods group revised up its full-year forecast at the same time as admitting “commercial irregularities” at a subsidiary in India. The latter could lead to a writedown on Adidas’s balance sheet of €125m – equivalent to one-sixth of last year’s pre-tax income. It was also the first time investors were made aware of the troubles in India. Yet shares jumped 5 per cent to a record high.Investors might be forgiven for overlooking glitches this time. After all, Adidas’s new 12-17 per cent net income growth target for this year, up from 10-15 per cent previously, includes the extra €70m it might cost to sort out its mess in India. The country is not one of its top 10 markets by sales. And the group’s growth strategy centres around China, the US and Russia now.But the new growth target also alleviates some fears about Adidas’s exposure to Europe. The region makes up 30 per cent of sales, compared with 23 per cent at its rival Nike. Yet strong growth in China and Japan helped the 14 per cent growth in first-quarter revenues from a year earlier. Operating margins also improved to hit 10.7 per cent – the best first-quarter performance on this metric since before the crisis struck. That suggests the cost of repositioning Reebok, which it bought back in 2006, is easing. Which gives some confidence that Adidas is on the right track to meet its target of full-year operating margins of 11 per cent by 2015, from 7.6 per cent in 2011. Even so, Adidas’s spectators have higher expectations now, so any more problems and the reaction may not be so forgiving.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
375;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Sportswear rivals resume race for publicity;Nike prepares to take on official Olympic sponsor Adidas;"Nike’s arch-rivalry with Adidas is focused on major sporting events, none more so than at the 2012 Olympics where Adidas will be the official sponsor, just as in Beijing.More on sponsors and the Olympic Games:

● Sponsors lay down Olympic challenge to rivals
● BMW to emphasise green identity at games
● EDF Energy has clear run at Olympic deal
● Cadbury makes most of sporting connectionNike says it supports “thousands of athletes” preparing for the Games, sponsoring 14 national basketball teams, and 11 in track and field, including the US, Russia, China, Brazil and Germany.This can lead to tensions, with many high-profile athletes having to balance contrasting commercial obligations – an individual contract for one sportswear company and a team contract for its rival.The battleground is the medals podium. Usain Bolt’s 100m sprint triumph in Beijing overshadowed anything Nike or Adidas achieved at the 2008 Games, after the Jamaican sprinter milked the adulation of the crowd by taking off one of his Puma running shoes and posing for the cameras.Nike, which is pushing five new products this summer, says the Olympics is a time for bringing new footwear and sports gear to market. “We debut these innovations on the world’s most elite athletes and then commercialise the opportunity by providing those technologies to athletes everywhere,” it says."
376;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-04-10T23:00:19Z;Reebok told to stop sale of Tebow jerseys;;Reebok has been ordered by a judge to stop selling New York Jets football jerseys carrying the name of quarterback Tim Tebow after Nike sued its rival for doing so “illegitimately”.Nike, the world’s biggest sporting goods maker by sales, took over from Reebok as a National Football League sponsor this month and was angered when its rival sought to capitalise on Mr Tebow’s transfer to the Jets in late March.The US judge Kevin Castel ordered Reebok, an Adidas subsidiary, to stop making and selling unauthorised Tebow products in a ruling on Monday. He also told the company to recall all products in distribution channels and to tell retailers that selling them could expose them to liability.Nike had made a claim for damages, but the judgment made no reference to any being awarded. It said no costs or fees were to be paid to either party.The companies issued separate but identical statements on Tuesday that said: “We’re pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable resolution.”Mr Tebow became an unlikely hero for snatching a string of last-ditch wins for the Denver Broncos and taking them to last season’s play-offs. He is a devout Christian famed for celebrating wins by sinking to one knee in prayer.Nike unveiled its new NFL uniforms on April 3 and the deal with the American football competition is expected to be a key driver of its sales growth this year in the US. The new season begins in September.
377;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-04-08T16:40:07Z;Bosco bets on boost from London Olympics;;Bosco, one of Russia’s best-known fashion brands, is betting that the London Olympics will provide a fillip for its first international store as the sports and leisurewear retailer enters the British market.The clothing label, which designs the kit worn by the Russian Olympics team, plans to open outlets across Europe in destinations favoured by wealthy Russian tourists such as the ski resorts of Courchevel and St Moritz. It has chosen London as the location to kick-start this expansion, despite the gloomy economic outlook, citing its large Russian community and status as host city of the 2012 Olympic Games.Bosco opened its first international store at the end of March in Westfield Stratford City, Europe’s largest shopping centre positioned on the doorstep of the Olympic Park.Mikhail Kusnirovich, the group’s founder, said he saw the event as an opportunity for the business to take the first steps outside its domestic market.“We’re very open to take a lot of lessons in a different [retail] case,” Mr Kusnirovich said. “We are already well-known in our home market but to be present in another part of the world we need some step [up] from London.”He said he was not daunted by the challenges of establishing an unknown consumer brand overseas at a time when cash-strapped consumers are cutting back on non-essentials.Olympic sponsors have traditionally sought to use the global reach and feel good factor of the games to boost their brand value and market share in host countries.Adidas, the long-term sportswear provider for the Olympics, said it is hoping to use London 2012 as a springboard to overtake Nike as the sportswear market leader in the UK. Dow Chemical, which signed up as a global Olympic sponsor in 2010, said one of the reasons it became a sponsor was to increase its presence in emerging markets.Bosco has developed its brand almost entirely in association with the Olympics.Its parent company Bosco di Ciliegi was established in Moscow over 20 years ago to act as a distributor for designer Italian brands, but in 2001 the company was asked to design some of the uniforms worn by Russian Olympics athletes competing in the Salt Lake City Olympics the following year.The Bosco chain, which has 64 stores across Russia and Ukraine, is also targeting Spain where it is the official designer of Olympics kit for the Spanish Olympic and Paralympic teams this year.
378;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-30T12:40:27Z;Reebok ordered to halt sale of Tebow jerseys;;Reebok has been ordered to temporarily stop making and selling New York Jets clothing carrying Tim Tebow’s name after Nike filed a lawsuit accusing it of using the quarterback’s name “illegitimately”.A federal judge on Thursday said there was “sufficient reason” to justify the order ahead of a full hearing on Nike’s claims that Reebok’s actions were unauthorised and were causing Nike “immediate and irreparable harm” by denying it potential sales.Nike said that Reebok has been selling without authorisation New York Jets jerseys and T-shirts carrying the Tebow name since Mr Tebow’s transfer to the team from the Denver Broncos last week,Next Tuesday, Nike will launch its new National Football League uniforms, having officially taken over the license to produce them on April 1 from Reebok, a subsidiary of Adidas.Reebok was ordered to file its papers responding to the temporary injunction by the afternoon of April 3.The order also requires Reebok to recall Tebow merchandise from distribution channels that it controls and to repurchase merchandise from retailers and distributors at no less than the price they paid for it.Reebok said late on Thursday: “While Reebok opposed the application for the temporary restraining order, the court did grant us appropriate time to gather and present our facts and argue our position necessary to refute Nike’s contentions. We intend to present that evidence at a hearing next week, which should enable the court to change its view once all the evidence is presented.”Fearing that it is missing out on sales, Nike said in its complaint: “It is unlikely that a consumer who purchases an unauthorised Tebow-identified NFL jersey or T-shirt from Reebok this week will purchase an authorised Tebow jersey or T-shirt from Nike the following week.”Nike said its “efforts to obtain orders from retailers for Tebow-identified Jets products have been rebuffed because retailers have pending orders with Reebok and want to sell through such inventory before placing orders with Nike”.The complaint said Nike already has the rights to use the Tebow name from a previous agreement with the player, but it acknowledges that Reebok can use the NFL brand on Jets products without his name until March 31.The judge on Thursday specified that the order did not apply to Denver Broncos clothing marked with the Tebow name so long as Reebok held the appropriate rights.Mr Tebow became an unlikely hero last season for snatching a string of last-ditch wins for the Denver Broncos and taking them to the play-offs. He is a devout Christian famed for celebrating wins by sinking to one knee in prayer.
379;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-30T08:38:51Z;Apple: China to profit from rising wages even if companies feel the pinch (a bit);;"Apple’s decision to back wide-ranging pay and labour reforms at the Chinese factories of Foxconn, its biggest contract supplier, will clearly raise costs at both companies.But the Apple empire will not see a serious dent in its profitability, as its high-tech competitors will have to follow suit. And it’s a price worth paying to keep on the right side of consumers who don’t like the idea of buying iPhones made by slaves – and of the Chinese authorities who have backed pay rises for workers to help spread the benefits of economic growth.Investors believe the electronics industry can take this in its stride. Despite the dramatic headlines, shares in Hon Hai, Foxconn’s parent, fell just 1.3 per cent in Taipei on Friday, following a 1.3 per cent drop in Apple on Thursday.As the FT reported, the news came hours after Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, toured a Foxconn production line in China, when the US-based Fair Labor Association announced the contract manufacturer had agreed to improve conditions for its 1.2m workers.With Foxconn operating at profit margins of only 1.5 per cent, compared to 30 per cent at Apple, it’s clear that the world’s most valuable company by capitalisation will have to bear most of the extra cost.It won’t have any difficulty finding the money in its $100bn cash pile. Nor should the agreement gravely impair its profitability. The estimated manufacturing labour content of an iPhone or iPad is around 5 per cent. China Capital Securities puts labour costs at just 2-3 per cent of total operating costs at Hon Hai.The impact on western companies less profitable than Apple might be more significant, because these manufacturers will now come under pressure both in the US and China. Those in the firing line include Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, Motorola and Sony.But the industry as a whole should be able to manage the shock, just as the sports shoe sector adapted to higher Chinese labour costs in the 1990s after a high-profile campaign against Nike, the market leader. Just like Nike, Apple and co make stuff that everybody seems to want.Pay has already been rising, with Foxconn leading the way following a spate of suicides in 2010. Last month the company announced another round of wage increases of 16-25 per cent.And Beijing wants to see further improvements over the coming years so that workers benefit from the fruits of their labours. It wants to see criticism of rich Communist party bosses and their cronies defused and the economy rebalanced away from exports towards domestic consumption.China’s share of low-tech exports has already started to fall. It accounted for 53.6 per cent of US imports of textiles and clothes last year, compared to 53 per cent in 2010. Low-wage Vietnam and Bangladesh are among the countries gaining market share.But this isn’t bad for China. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the east Asian economies which became wealthy through their manufacturing process, all moved out of low-tech exports as they moved up the value chain.Chinese average wages are now above those of its low-pay rivals, as the chart below shows. But it has a big cost advantage over Malaysia and Thailand, exporters of the high-tech hardware that China now wants to move into.Furthermore, China, with its good education levels, big infrastructure developments and work ethic remains very competitive, not least in its inland regions, where wages lag behind those on the coast. As this chart shows, China’s export prices in dollar terms are not rising as fast as prices from other emerging markets.Companies as well as countries are adjusting. Indeed. Hon Hai is a perfect example. Only this week it announced plans to buy 10 per cent of Sharp, the ailing Japanese display screen company, in a $806m deal. It may have made its fortune in low-cost labour but it sees its future in high-end technology.Related reading

The tech-heavy index declined more than 0.3 per cent to 3,095.36.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, increased by as much as 10 per cent before finishing the day down marginally to 15.42.Natural and organic food companies were also among the day’s most active stocks.Supermarket group Whole Foods Markets was hit by a downgrade of its shares by Goldman Sachs, who said the company lacked upside, having gained 35 per cent in the year.Shares in the upmarket food retailer fell 3.5 per cent to $82.61 as analysts reduced their rating from “buy” to “hold”. “Whole Foods Markets is a secular winner with significant opportunity to grow its store base, expand margins and improve its return on capital,” said Stephen Grambling, analyst at Goldman Sachs.“However, with only 2.8 per cent upside to our upwardly revised price target, after increasing our estimates, we see better opportunities elsewhere in our coverage, prompting a ‘hold’ rating,” he added.Annie’s, a natural and organic foods company, climbed another 5.6 per cent to reach $37.92.Shares in the company, which opened to the public on Wednesday, have nearly doubled from its initial offering price of $19.Nike, the world’s biggest sporting goods maker by sales, gained 0.6 per cent to $107.85 as the company said it had sued rival Reebok for the use of quarterback Tim Tebow’s name on the back of New York Jets jerseys.Nike will launch its new uniforms for the National Football League under a new sponsorship deal.JetBlue, a US passenger airline, lost 4.2 per cent to $5 as the carrier tried to deal with the fallout from an emergency landing of one its aircraft on Tuesday after the captain of the plane was forcibly subdued.News Corp, the international media company, lost 1.5 per cent to $19.44 as the company run by Rupert Murdoch hit back at claims that a technology company it once controlled was used to facilitate piracy of private documents.The S&P 500 financial index was the biggest faller among the major sectors on the benchmark US index, which were all down on the day, and fell 1.1 per cent.Insurance companies were among the hardest hit financial stocks with Genworth Financial down 2.3 per cent to $8.45 and Lincoln National Corporation off 3.2 per cent to $25.75.Morgan Stanley fell by 2.5 per cent, the worst among the big banks, to $19.74. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were all down over 2 per cent on the day.Homebuilders, which have outperformed US equities by nearly three times in the year to date, also declined on Thursday.PulteGroup was down 2.3 per cent to $9.26 and rival DR Horton dropped 3.3 per cent to $15.39.The S&P 500 homebuilders sub index, which is comprised of two companies and a third Lennar Corp, is still up 32.5 per cent since the start of 2012 while the main US index has risen just under 11 per cent in the same period.

It is seeking an order barring Reebok from selling the items and unspecified damages.Mr Tebow became an unlikely hero for snatching a string of last-ditch wins for the Denver Broncos and taking them to last season’s play-offs. He is a devout Christian famed for celebrating wins by sinking to one knee in prayer.His transfer to the New York Jets, a team from the US’s largest sports and media market, has generated round-the-clock news coverage in what is normally a quiet period for NFL activity, one month after the end of the season, the complaint says.The NFL deal is expected to be a key driver of Nike’s sales growth this year in the US.“The opportunity to sell the first Tebow-identified Jets apparel is a unique and shortlived opportunity,” Nike’s complaint says.“It is unlikely that a consumer who purchases an unauthorised Tebow-identified NFL jersey or T-shirt from Reebok this week will purchase an authorised Tebow jersey or T-shirt from Nike the following week.”Nike said its “efforts to obtain orders from retailers for Tebow-identified Jets products have been rebuffed because retailers have pending orders with Reebok and want to sell through such inventory before placing orders with Nike”.Mr Tebow was promoted from second-string quarterback at the Broncos and is expected to be an unusually high-profile back up in New York too when the new season begins in September.Nike’s complaint says that it already has the rights to use the Tebow name from a previous agreement with the player. But it acknowledges that Reebok can use the NFL brand on products without his name until March 31. Nike’s license to use the NFL brand begins on April 1.Reebok said in a statement: “Reebok was notified of the lawsuit only earlier today and had no prior knowledge of any dispute. At this time we still have not seen all the legal papers, and therefore, have no comment.”

PulteGroup, another homebuilder, dropped 2.6 per cent to $8.88 while rival Lennar fell 1 per cent to $25.86.The S&P 500 homebuilders index, which had risen 80 per cent since last October, has lost more than 3.5 per cent this week.Key housing data released throughout the week showed signs that, while the housing market was stabilising, the pace of recovery was slowing.“After the run-up we have had this year, you want to see the markets take a pause and consolidate,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “They were not any new, fresh drivers to take us higher this week with the data being mixed.”“For the week overall, I’d probably give the US housing data a grade of B- or C+. There are some details to suggest we are bumping along the bottom rather than falling off the wagon. The story for the US is not great but it’s still improving and nothing this week changed our view.”Shares in Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, were halted after they plunged to $542 a share.A single mistaken trade on one of BATS’s exchanges was identified as the cause and corrected, according to a statement by BATS. Trading in Apple shares, which had retreated from highs earlier in the week, resumed soon after and fell 0.6 per cent to $596.05.But the troubles continued for BATS as the exchange was forced to withdraw its initial public offering on Friday, citing “technical issues” that caused its share price to plunge in the first moments of trading on its own exchange.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,397.11 on Friday, edging back towards the 1,400 mark after retreating from it earlier in the week.But the US benchmark has had its worst week since mid-December, falling 0.5 per cent and retreating from the post-financial crisis highs reached on Monday. However, the S&P 500 is still up 11 per cent on the year to date.Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, reported that revenues rose 15 per cent like-for-like to $5.8bn, driven by strong demand in North America, but its shares fell 3.2 per cent to $107.42 in trading on Friday as analysts considered the pressure on the company’s forward profit margins and valuation.Camilo Lyon, analyst at Canaccord, said of his “hold” rating: “Taking it altogether …we believe the stock should trade down, especially considering the peak 21 times price to earnings multiple at which it currently trades.“Given the strength in North America futures, we would rather play the strength of the footwear cycle via the retailers, in particular buy-rated Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods.”Citi analysts removed Nike from their top-picks list but reiterated their buy rating on confidence that sales growth would be driven by momentum in North America and China.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.1 per cent to to 3,067.92. The technology-heavy index fared the best among the three major US indices, up 0.4 per cent for the week.Netflix, the home DVD delivery and internet movie streaming provider, was among the week’s top gainers. Shares in the company rose by more than 9 per cent on the week and were trading at $120.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.2 per cent over the five trading days at 13,080.73 as equities on the blue-chip index were rattled by weak manufacturing data out of Europe and China released on Thursday.Earthmoving equipment manufacturer Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $107.83 on Friday but remained one of the weakest stocks among blue-chips for the week.Shares in the company, which have risen by 19 per cent in the year to date, fell by more than 5 per cent this week.Sears Holdings, parent company of the Sears and Kmart department store chains, fell by more than 12 per cent over the five days to make it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500.Last week, the company reported that it would shut down as many as 62 stores in the first half of the year to reduce its expenses but the move was little comfort to investors as the stock fell another 1.8 per cent to $72.36 on Friday.

Analysts had expected a boost in orders ahead of the London Olympic Games this summer and the company’s planned April unveiling of National Football League uniforms.Diluted earnings per share rose 11 per cent year-on-year to $1.20, beating forecasts.“We had a strong third quarter. Our relentless focus on innovation delivered powerful new products and services for athletes and consumers, and continues to drive value to our shareholders,” said Mark Parker, president and chief executive.“The environment remains volatile, but I’m optimistic about the future. We’re starting a great season of major sports events and we have a pipeline full of innovation to fuel growth over the long term.”Price increases and high demand for Nike’s running shoes and athletic gear compensated for rising product costs, that brought gross margins down by 200 basis points to 43.8 per cent. Selling and administrative expenses grew at a lower rate than revenue, up 10 per cent to $1.8bn.Revenues in greater China grew 25 per cent, up 21 per cent on a currency neutral basis, on greater demand for footwear. In other emerging markets, revenues rose 23 per cent, or 30 per cent when adjusting for currency fluctuations.Shares in Nike rose 0.3 per cent to $111.35 in after-market trading following the earnings release.
384;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-14T18:52:59Z;Blessed are the online tastemakers;Commercial messages can be carried far and wide;To have good taste, George Bernard Shaw once suggested, is to lack originality.If so, then it has never been easier to show off your good taste online. A group of fast-growing websites, led by companies such as Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest, is benefiting from what has become one of the most prevalent forms of internet behaviour: a desire simply to echo – and re-echo – the words, images and videos produced by someone else.Bathing in the reflected creativity of others has never been easier. But what this means for the ability to make money from producing original content – and for spreading advertising messages across the web – is only just starting to sink in.Behind this new trend in taste-setting are a few ingredients that seem to have become essential components of all new consumer internet services.One is the “follow” button: having created a personal profile, users invite others to track their future online activities. Another ingredient is the “reuse” button, which lets followers pick up content from someone they follow and copy it on to their own page, or profile.This reuse takes different forms, depending on the service. Twitter’s users were among the first to take to the idea, with “retweets” – passing on messages from other users to their own circle of followers. This served to amplify important messages and rubbed off on the reputation of the retweeter, who was cast in the new role of significant opinion-former.In the case of Tumblr, this has become the “reblog”. With its short posts and ability to show images, Tumblr took off last year: copying and mixing from other users is now a central part of the service.Pinterest, meanwhile – this year’s leading contender for the title of Hot New Thing– has added its own spin. A site for copying images found around the web, Pinterest lets its users “pin” pictures they find online on to interest-specific “boards” the create: others can then “repin” those pictures on to their own pages.With all this focus on reuse, “frictionless” has become the internet buzzword of the moment. Making it easy to pass on valuable nuggets of information with as little effort as possible is the goal.Plagiarism? Perhaps, but the practice has been ennobled with its own term: curation. To select from the myriad fragments that have been filtered from the web by other people, according to this view, is the ultimate expression of personal taste. What, though, does it mean for businesses that seek to make money from content online – either by selling it, or using it to generate advertising?Re-posting may amplify the impact of a thought or an image, but it also serves to distance it from its creator. According to the head of one leading internet site, the re-blogging craze leads to between five and eight instances of reuse for any piece of content that has been picked up, depending on the service. Often, only the first use of a piece of content links back to the original: producers get no direct benefit from the later amplification.Among other things, this raises thorny legal issues for websites that make it too easy for their users to copy content from others. Generally, sites are protected from legal challenge as long as they remove copyrighted content when asked to do so by the owner. But that defence won’t hold up for any site whose main purpose is judged to involve copyright infringement.Pinterest, mindful of the risk, recently released a piece of code that other websites can use to block Pinterest users from “borrowing” their images. Yet this leaves websites with a difficult choice. Pinterest’s influence is growing quickly – it has more than 15m monthly users, according to Nielsen – so turning off the tap of traffic referrals might prove costly.Smart advertisers, meanwhile, are already learning how to turn their messages into content that can be re-posted through these new networks. Much product advertising lends itself to tasteful images, making Pinterest a natural network for spreading such messages.As with much of the new online “sharing” – a harmless-sounding word that hides a million sins – the losers will be those who fail to strike the right balance between protecting valuable content and giving internet users enough incentive to generate valuable referrals.The winners, on the other hand, will be those who tap into the new tastemakers to amplify a commercial message that can carry far and wide. As with joggers who proudly sport Nike or Adidas logos on their running vests, you might call this the ultimate expression of good taste.Or you might conclude that they’ve been co-opted by a commercial system that always seems capable of adapting to the latest new medium.
385;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-14T03:05:07Z;Vietnam offers companies China alternative;;Rapidly rising wages may be a headache for manufacturers and the communist leadership in China, but they are good news for people like Ngo Truong Chinh in Vietnam.Mr Chinh recently took a job as a quality control manager at a factory that XP Power, the UK-listed electronic components manufacturer, has just opened in Binh Duong province, part of Vietnam’s main industrial belt near Ho Chi Minh City.“Labour costs are cheaper in Vietnam but the workers’ skills are good,” says Mr Chinh, a 35-year-old electronics graduate. “That’s why many foreign manufacturers are investing in Vietnam.”XP Power is just one of many manufacturers looking to diversify production beyond their China base to capitalise on lower wages and mitigate the risks of concentration in one location – a peril highlighted last year by the industrial impact of the devastating Thai floods and Japanese tsunami and earthquake.With China’s experienced workforce, well-developed supply chain and vast scale, few people believe its position as the world’s workshop is under threat. But spiralling wage costs in China have driven a growing number of labour-intensive manufacturers to switch to countries with lower wages, such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam.Unskilled workers in Vietnam are typically paid $100-150 a month, compared to the $300 their counterparts might receive in the manufacturing clusters of southern China. And while Vietnam’s infrastructure cannot compare with its much wealthier northern neighbour, factory managers say that they can cope with both the occasional power cuts and delays at Vietnam’s under-developed ports.Vietnam already exports billions of dollars of basic manufactured goods such as shoes, clothes and wooden furniture to Europe and the US each year. It surpassed China in 2010 as the biggest source of footwear for Nike, the international sports brand.The arrival of more companies like XP Power, which makes industrial power supplies, will test whether Vietnam has the skilled workers and infrastructure needed to tempt more technologically-advanced, higher value-added manufacturers. Pioneers like chipmaker Intel and Samsung, the South Korean electronics group, have already set up factories in Vietnam and are ramping up production. Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone, announced plans last year to build a mobile phone factory in northern Vietnam.“Productivity in Vietnam is slightly behind China,” says S. Kesavan, the Vietnam head of Jabil Circuit, a US electronics manufacturer. “But the recent escalation of costs in China is making us relocate in order to be competitive.”Jabil plans to expand the workforce at its Ho Chi Minh City factory, which produces energy meters and credit card readers, from 1,000 to 3,000 employees over the next two years.But with the highest annual inflation rate in Asia – even after price increases slowed to 16.4 per cent in February – Vietnam’s low-cost advantage will not last long. While the median age of 27.4 years is below China’s 35.2 years, the population is ageing, according to a recent report by McKinsey, the management consultant, and Vietnam’s demographic dividend is starting to shrink.Analysts say that Vietnam must move away from its dependence on low-cost manufacturing to put an end to recent economic turbulence and deliver on its promises of rapid growth.Some manufacturers are already complaining of labour shortages. McKinsey says Vietnam must increase labour productivity by more than 50 per cent to make up for the slowing workforce growth, if the communist government is to meet its ambitious target of 7-8 per cent annual economic growth by 2020.Danish-owned ScanCom International, one of the world’s leading exporters of wooden outdoor furniture, is one company looking to move up the value chain in Vietnam. It has already doubled output per employee among the 4,000 workers at its sprawling Binh Duong factory by introducing more modern equipment, turning waste into new products and improving training, according to Stig Maasbøl, ScanCom’s chief executive.ScanCom plans to double output again over the next two years by bringing in more advanced machinery, such as drilling and sanding robots that can do the work of 50 people under the supervision of just one.“If Vietnam’s attraction is only wages, companies will soon be looking to Cambodia and Myanmar,” he says.
386;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-10T01:23:51Z;Facebook co-founder buys New Republic;;Chris Hughes, one of the co-founders of Facebook, has bought The New Republic, the 98-year old liberal-leaning magazine, making the leap from new media to old in an attempt to bridge the two.Mr Hughes, 28, became the publisher and editor-in-chief of the magazine on Friday, putting his focus on improving distribution of the magazine’s long-form writing to the iPad and other computer tablets. The magazine’s purchase price was not disclosed.The new job title adds to his already expansive resume, which includes building the largest social network in history, leaving Facebook to help create Barack Obama’s online organising campaign in the 2008 presidential election and then in 2011, launching Jumo, his own social networking start-up, since merged with Good.Mr Hughes is one of several former Facebook employees marking a transition point in their post-Facebook careers this week and last.Dave Morin, chief executive of Path and a former Facebook engineer, rolled out new features of his mobile social network on Thursday, including new camera filters, music capturing abilities and a running application, in partnership with Nike, that tracks users while they go running and allows them to share details of their route with their friends.Mr Morin emphasised the privacy features of the app, drawing a distinction between Path and Facebook’s “frictionless sharing” of workout information and reinforcing Path’s commitment to protect user data after emerging from its first privacy scandal last month.“We want Path to be a place that feels safe, like a dinner table at your house,” Mr Morin said.Also on Thursday, Joe Green, who did not work at Facebook, but lived in a dorm room next to the persons who started it, became president of NationBuilder, a community organising system for political candidates and artists. The Los Angeles-based company, founded by Jim Gilliam and Mr Green in 2009, also closed $6.25m in financing from Andreessen Horowitz and brought Ben Horowitz and Sean Parker on to their board.Last week, Aditya Agarwal and Ruchi Sanghvi, a husband and wife engineering duo who were among Facebook’s earliest key employees, took on senior roles at Dropbox when the digital file-sharing service acquired their start-up, Cove. The couple’s collaboration system for non-profit organisations was still in stealth mode.
387;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
388;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-07T16:37:54Z;Adidas: three stripes and it’s out;Until investors know how targets will be hit, shares may be due a breather;The thinnest of margins can make all the difference between glory and heartbreak for top athletes. Investors in Adidas, one of the big suppliers of their kit, may empathise. The German sportswear manufacturer fell marginally short of expectations when reporting 2011 earnings on Wednesday – and was rewarded with a 3 per cent slip in its share price.There is little wrong with a company which pushes annual sales up 13 per cent – led, geographically, by China but with solid double-digit advances in the core western Europe and US markets – while holding operating margins at 7.6 per cent. But higher raw material prices and wage inflation caused gross margins to ease to 47.5 per cent in the full year – and slip from 46.5 to 45.6 per cent (year-on-year) in the seasonally weak final quarter. Moreover, the group is relatively conservative about 2012 sales, forecasting only single-digit growth in the 5-9 per cent range, in spite of the sports-heavy year (Olympics, European Football Championship) – although Adidas does tend to be cautious. And input and wage cost pressures are once again creeping upwards, although lower expenses elsewhere should still allow operating margins this year to approach 8 per cent.In short, investors may wonder whether Adidas is turning from a sprinter into a middle-distance runner. Its shares have risen almost 60 per cent in the last two years, and now trade on a 16 times forward multiple – the top of their range historically. That remains cheaper than rival Nike, which has precisely matched Adidas’ share price performance over the same period, but a premium to Puma. Adidas has a heady €17bn sales target for 2015, but its goal of an 11 per cent operating margin, by the same date, may be the bigger challenge. Until investors are clearer on how that will be achieved, the shares could be due for a breather.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
389;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-07T08:13:04Z;Adidas says sales growth could slow;;Adidas said growth in sales and earnings might slow this year in spite of the marketing boost expected from sporting events such as the Olympic Games.The sports goods supplier on Wednesday said sales should rise by a “mid-to-high single-digit rate” this year, after an increase last year of 13 per cent, the fastest rate since 2006. For 2012 earnings per share should be between €3.52 and €3.68, Adidas said, implying an increase of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent compared with the 18 per cent rise achieved last year.The German group, number two by sales in the world behind Nike, has a record of giving cautious market guidance, having repeatedly raised its expectations for 2011 during the course of the year. The sales target for this year was slightly behind that of Puma, Adidas’s local rival, which last month predicted a sales rise close to 10 per cent.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said Adidas had “made progress on improving profitability” and “couldn’t have asked for a better start” in its plan to increase sales by up to 50 per cent between 2010, when they reached €12bn, and 2015.Net income rose from €567m to €671m while annual sales reached €13.3bn. Fourth-quarter sales rose 11 per cent, including a 19 per cent increase in North America, one of the markets that Adidas has said should bring strong growth, along with Russia and China.Adidas’s gross margin was slightly lower in 2011, but it raised its operating margin from 7.5 per cent to 7.6 per cent. The operating margin – an important yardstick of profitability, which Adidas says it can raise to 11 per cent by 2015 – should be close to 8 per cent in 2012, the company said.Robin Stalker, chief financial officer, told analysts it was logical that most margin improvements would come towards the end of the period in question. “Investments have to happen at the beginning to give us further leverage going forward,” Mr Stalker said.Adidas ended the year with net cash of €90m, its first postive year-end balance since 2005, according to Mr Stalker.Its results tend to get a lift in years of big sporting events such as the Olympics. Adidas said it would be “the most visible brand” during this year’s games in London, where it is supplying the British team and Olympic officials and volunteers. The company also expects faster growth to come from continued expansion of its own-store network. Retail sales rose 20 per cent last year, adjusted for currency effects.Adidas intends to increase its dividend by 25 per cent to €1. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to €56.03.
390;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-07T02:02:20Z;Viral campaigns: Lights, camera, blender! How to create a hit;April Dembosky looks behind the success of internet sensations;Food blenders do not make the sexiest marketing material. But Blendtec found a way round that by having its chief executive, Tom Dickson, drop an iPhone into its home blender, push the smoothie button, and grind it to a black dust.“I’m going to put this on Ebay,” he tells the camera, holding up a cocktail glass full of smoking iPhone dust and flashing an earnest smile.The video was viewed 10.5m times on YouTube. To date, Blendtec has made 130 Will it Blend? videos, featuring the destruction of lightbulbs, golf balls, even a Nike running shoe. Almost all have gone viral.Since the company started the “ meme” in 2006, sales of its retail blender have shot up almost 800 per cent, says Kels Goodman, Blendtec’s video producer. “It was entertainment, not selling,” he says. “That’s why people loved it.”These days, practically every marketer is salivating for a similar internet sensation. With the extensive reach of Facebook and Twitter, and the speed of sharing that comes with them, a short video can be distributed at almost no cost on the web, usually with the recommendation of a trusted friend behind it. The value to companies over the anonymous, multimillion-dollar placement on television is huge.But coming up with a video that taps into the cultural zeitgeist is an elusive task.“Everyone wants every campaign to be viral, just like everybody wants every movie to be a hit,” says Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “But it’s not something you can plan for. There’s no formula for saying ‘this will strike a chord and get millions of views’.”There are some key elements to a viral video, she says, such as being very funny, very topical, or using cutting-edge technology, like Burger King’s online “subservient chicken”.Building on a television commercial, the 2004 online campaign featured a man dressed in a chicken suit with a garter belt and stockings who performed whatever action a user typed into a dialogue box on the screen, from touching its toes to doing Michael Jackson’s moonwalk. The gimmick promoted the chain’s fried chicken sandwich and “Have it your way” campaign slogan.More recently, Old Spice has had raging success online, finding multiple ways to exploit its iconic “the man your man could smell like” character, who spoke to potential customers in 2010, half-naked, from a beachside shower: “Hello ladies. How are you? Fantastic. Does your man look like me? No. Can he smell like me? Yes. Should he use Old Spice body wash?”Two weeks after that commercial aired, the company’s advertising team at Wieden+Kennedy pushed social media to a new level, when it took questions from fans on Facebook and Twitter, then wrote, produced, and posted video spots online of their Old Spice guy answering them, in less than 10 minutes each. Many thousands wrote in.Sales of Old Spice body wash doubled after the social campaign, compared with the same time period the year before, the company said.“It was so far off the chart compared with what we had dreamed about,” says Mike Norton of Old Spice. “Also, you get this instant feedback and sentiment analysis from people who put their trust in the brand and want to be part of it.”“It’s almost unfair to own what we did – it’s so basic,” says Jason Bagley, a creative director with Wieden. But the experience confirms to him: “Social media campaigns are going to exist for a long time.”In some cases, companies have come up with such successful “memes” that they build a secondary marketing business around it.Just three months into the Will it Blend? series, Blendtec started receiving calls from other companies, including Ford and Google, begging them to destroy their product in the blender. Blendtec charged anywhere from $5,000 to $35,000 for each video, with the price going up if the company wanted the video posted to Blendtec’s unique YouTube channel.But this made Mr Goodman wary, as the more promotional videos were posted, the more he felt it hurt the entertainment value of the series.Ms Lieb confirms there is a balancing act marketers must perform. “The most viral campaign is the least branded,” she says. “People don’t pass on commercials. They pass along jokes and stories, things that really resonate with them, not ‘30 days to whiter teeth and fresher breath’.”“That has led to a wave of home-made videos starring ordinary people that are in fact company-backed ads made by professional producers and paid actors.”But there are two dangers here as well. One is that people may never connect the ad with the brand, laughing and talking about a funny beer commercial, but not remembering what brand it was for.The other danger is not reaching the right audience for the product. Blendtec’s videos were hugely popular with young boys who enjoyed watching things crash and explode – not the demographic that buys $400 blenders. But over time, middle-aged women bought a Blendtec Total Blender, saying their sons saw it on YouTube.As always, with a hit, there is pressure to produce another: this puts makers of accidental successes in a tough spot.“The good days of Will it Blend? were when we were just fooling around,” Mr Goodman says. “Once you have to start concentrating, once you start putting dollar signs and a timeframe to creativity, it’s really hard.”
391;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-04T23:18:21Z;P2i shows the power of protection;;Nanotechnology group P2i was born after the Ministry of Defence co-funded a study to improve soldiers’ protective clothing against chemical attack.Since then, the liquid repellent nano-coating technology that stemmed from Stephen Coulson’s PhD thesis at Durham university has been used to protect products ranging from mobile phones and hearing aids to clothing and footwear.P2i was established in January 2004. After raising £40m over several funding rounds – including £11.4m last year – it employs 160 staff across the UK, Asia and US. “Spinning out the company was something that we wanted to do right back in 1997 when we invented the technology,” said Mr Coulson, P2i chief technology officer.P2i’s technology – protected by more than 50 MoD-backed patents – employs a pulsed ionised gas created within a vacuum chamber to attach a thin polymer layer over the external and internal surfaces of a product.The polymer, 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, lowers the product’s surface energy, so that liquids form beads upon contact and roll off. The result is a durable liquid-repellent coating that does not affect the product’s look or feel. P2i has installed more than 100 nano-coating machines within major manufacturing centres around the world.The company’s technology, which also acts as an anti-microbial and flame retardant, has been used to protect more than 8m electronic devices, including Motorola mobile phones and 60 per cent of the world’s hearing aids. P2i doubled its sales from 2010-11 to £6m, and its customers include Timberland, the footwear and clothing group, and shoe brands K-Swiss, Adidas, Mizuno and Nike.In addition, P2i has customers in both the life-science and filtration sectors, and has also sold a system to the MoD, which holds a 2.7 per cent stake in the business.Other stakeholders include Porton Capital – which provided much of P2i’s initial funding and still holds a 20 per cent share – and several large venture capital companies such as Unilever Ventures, Naxos Capital Partners and Durham university.“The biggest challenge once you’ve spun out the company is obtaining those first few customers and demonstrating that it’s a cost-effective industrial process,” Mr Coulson said.In 2010, the group acquired Surface Innovations, a UK-based with a range of nano-coating patents that expanded potential applications for P2i’s technology to include anti-bacterial resistance.“There’s no reason why our technology can’t be used on any solid object,” Mr Coulson said.
392;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-03-03T00:46:54Z;My quest for football’s Holy Grail;Where is the Jules Rimet trophy? The statuette vanished in Rio de Janeiro in 1983 – or perhaps in Europe in the 1950s;Where is the Jules Rimet trophy? Football’s original world cup vanished in Rio de Janeiro in 1983 – or perhaps in Europe in the 1950s. Either way, the gilded statuette is missing. Almost everyone thinks it was melted down into gold bars in a Brazilian foundry. However, that’s probably wrong. I’ve hunted football’s version of The Maltese Falcon for years, and I believe it’s still around. Recent work – including the documentary Rimet Trophy, by Lorenzo Garzella, Filippo Macelloni and César Meneghetti – elucidates the mystery.When the Frenchman Jules Rimet created the World Cup, he needed a trophy. In 1929, the Parisian sculptor Abel Lafleur made him a 30cm statuette of Nike, Greek goddess of victory. Crucially, the trophy wasn’t solid gold: merely silver coated with gold. Yet nobody could resist it.According to the documentary, the first people to try to steal football’s greatest prize were the Nazis. During the war they searched the Roman apartment of the Italian football official Ottorino Barassi, but couldn’t find the Rimet. They missed the shoebox hidden under Barassi’s bed.After West Germany became world champions in 1954, the Rimet went to Frankfurt. Jim Lynch and Joe Coyle, now writing a book about the Rimet, believe that the trophy disappeared in 1957 or 1958 while under German control. The photojournalist Coyle noticed in photographs that the 1954 trophy didn’t look like the one awarded in Sweden in 1958. The 1958 trophy was 5cm taller and had a markedly different base. Lynch and Coyle established that the cup that reached Sweden from Germany in 1958 was a replica. That would mean the Rimet had then already disappeared.But some kind of cup, calling itself the Rimet, arrived in London in 1966 for the World Cup in England. Famously, that March it was stolen from an exhibition. A week later, a dog named Pickles found the cup under a bush in south London.That is well-known. Less well-known is that after Pickles’ discovery, England’s Football Association secretly asked the jeweller George Bird to make a replica. Bird produced a gilded bronze trophy that looked just like the cup Pickles had found, writes Martin Atherton in his book The Theft of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Now there were two Rimets, or perhaps three if the original had indeed disappeared in the 1950s.Bird’s tale has a curious postscript. After he died in 1995, his family auctioned his replica. “Copy of the Jules Rimet Cup”, said the description of lot 80 at a Sotheby’s auction in 1997. At auction, Bird’s cheap bronze fake went for an astonishing £254,500. The winning bidder was anonymous.“It was an absurd price,” a friendly auctioneer told me. “Unless you know it’s the real world cup. And the winning bidder knew.” The winning bidder presumably believed that in 1970, the English had performed a secret switch: kept the real Rimet and sent Bird’s replica to Mexico, host of the next tournament.That anonymous bidder turned out to be Fifa, the global football authority. In 2006, I asked Fifa if it had thought Bird’s trophy was the real Rimet. I didn’t expect a reply. But Fifa’s media office emailed back: “Yes, Fifa took the decision to buy this trophy as it was thought to be the original one.”However, Fifa was wrong. The trophy it bought turned out to be merely Bird’s replica. England had sent the real Rimet – or at least what it thought was the Rimet – to Mexico.When Brazil won its third World Cup in Mexico in 1970, it was allowed to keep the Rimet – or perhaps a 1950s German-made replica. In 1983, the trophy was stolen from Brazil’s football federation in Rio. Nobody has seen the thing since. Brazilian police found the thieves but not the trophy – the investigators said it had been melted down into gold bars. Having told this story, the police felt free to drop the case.But the story has holes. For a start, the Rimet couldn’t be melted into gold bars because it wasn’t solid gold. Most likely, the German replica wasn’t all gold either. Moreover, the police had no evidence the trophy had been melted down. Indeed, the convicted Argentine gold dealer Juan Carlos Hernández testified that he didn’t melt it down. An analysis of his foundry found traces of gold of a different quality from the trophy.At my request, the journalist Andrew Downie put these points to Pedro Berwanger, the Brazilian federal police officer who led the original investigation. Berwanger admitted: “Nobody really knows what happened to the cup. I wouldn’t sign a document swearing it was melted down.” He told Downie the trophy would be worth most intact: “It’d almost be like having the Holy Grail, owning this trophy.” Berwanger feels the investigation remains incomplete.Most likely, the Rimet is now in some crooked collector’s backroom, either in Brazil or Europe. I will keep looking.simon.kuper@ft.com
393;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-24T00:05:35Z;Bleak Christmas for Gap as earnings drop 40%;;Gap’s efforts to revive its fortunes suffered another setback in the crucial Christmas quarter when the clothes retailer’s sales fell both in the US and overseas and net earnings dropped 40 per cent.The San Francisco-based company said on Thursday that like-for-like sales at Gap-branded stores in North America fell 3 per cent from a year ago while international sales were down 8 per cent in the three months to January 28. Analysts said the company continued to suffer from its uninspiring range of clothes.Gap has spent several years struggling to reverse slumping sales in the US. The company lost its verve in fashion and branding, faces rising sourcing costs, and has become a symbol of a perceived surplus of stores in a fragile US economy where ecommerce is growing.In the fourth quarter, its net earnings tumbled 40 per cent to $218m on sales that fell $100m to $4.3bn, but profits were slightly better than Wall Street had expected. Gap shares declined 1.2 per cent to $23.25 in after-hours trading after it released its results.The company also announced a new $1bn share buy-back plan having repurchased $2.1bn of its own shares last year.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said: “We all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap.” For the 12 months, like-for-like sales were down 4 per cent while net income fell 17 per cent to $833m.But Mr Murphy said the company had made progress by closing 65 US stores and opening new outlets overseas to rebalance Gap’s geographical exposure. The Gap group had 2,650 stores in North America at the end of the quarter out of its global total of 3,263.Mr Murphy said a new creative centre, established last year in New York to bring together design, production and marketing operations, was beginning to make a difference, with its first clothes going on sale in stores in the past two weeks.The new products have got more favourable reviews than Gap is used to, given a common criticism that it has struggled to get beyond khakis and button-down shirts, but analysts say it may not have enough attractive styles to excel in a hyper-competitive retail market.In the latest in a series of management changes earlier this week, Gap appointed Liz Meltzer, a former Uniqlo executive, to oversee international merchandising, and Jill Stanton, a former Nike executive, as creative adviser for Old Navy.Gap said sales at its Old Navy business in North America fell 6 per cent. The best performance came at Banana Republic in North America, where sales were flat.In its international business, Mr Murphy said he was optimistic about China, where the group has 14 stores and plans to have 45 by the end of 2012.In Europe, he said the company had been hurt by austerity measures in its biggest markets – the UK and France – and by its failure to offer women’s clothes that appealed to customers.

Retailers like Li Ning and Anta Sports have been hit hard by increasing international competition from the likes of Nike and Adidas, as discussed in this video by Lex.One Chinese brand, Qiaodan Sports, has more than just competition to worry about, though: it is being sued by one of the world’s most famous sporting icons. Former NBA superstar Michael Jordan alleges that the company - whose name, Qiaodan, means ‘Jordan’ in China - has exploited his name and jersey number, 23, without consent.Jordan said in a statement: “It is deeply disappointing to see a company build a business off my Chinese name without my permission, use the number 23 and even attempt to use the names of my children… I think they [Chinese consumers] deserve to know what they are buying”.According to NBC, a spokesman for Quioden told Chinese media: “There is no connection, 23 is just a number like $23 or $230 dollars… I don’t think there is a problem at all here.”“Not everyone will think this is misleading,” the spokesman added. “There are so many Jordans besides the basketball player – there are many other celebrities both in the US and worldwide called Jordan.”The retailer was rater more measured in a statement distributed by the Xinhua News Agency.“Qiaodan is a trademark registered under the Chinese law by our company and the legitimate use of the trademark is protected,” it said. “We have always upheld the sportsmanship since our founding. We have continued to support the development of sports in China and have run the business honestly.”Jordan has been known as ‘Qiaodan’ in China since he was first seen on Chinese television playing for the US basketball team in the 1984 Olympics. The sportswear brand of the same name started life as Fujian Province Jinjiang Township Chendi Brookside General Supplies Factory Number Two – before reinventing itself in 1990.Jordan is not the only high-profile basketball star to have had recent problems with trademarks in China. Beyondbrics reported on Wednesday that Wuxi Risheng Sporting Goods – a small sporting goods company near Shanghai - has obtained a trademark on the Chinese name of Jeremy Lin, a Taiwanese-American player who has lit up the NBA over recent months.Well aware of the commercialism potential of his flourishing reputation, Lin filed an application on February 13 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to own ‘Linsanity’ – a term widely used in the international media.Jordan maintains that his lawsuit against Qiaodan is not about money. “It’s about principle and protecting my name,” he said. “Any monetary awards I might receive will be invested in growing the sport of basketball in China.”Related reading:

395;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-23T16:27:48Z;Big events could establish viewing alternative;Broadcasters hope more people will switch to watching rugby on television regularly, especially if the home nations perfom well in international competitions;Barney Francis, the managing director of Sky Sports, is in the unusual position of hoping that a global rugby tournament televised by a rival company will be a rip-roaring success.As with every Rugby World Cup (RWC) except the first in 1987, free-to-air ITV will be broadcasting the 2015 competition when it returns to England for the first time in 24 years. But it is Sky that really digs deep into the grass roots of the game.“A successful England rugby team has a very positive effect on [Sky] viewing figures, just as a successful [British and Irish] Lions tour does,” says Francis.“Post-2003 [when England won the World Cup in Australia], it was elevated to national consciousness in a way it had never been before. You remember Jonny Wilkinson appearing on Nike adverts alongside David Beckham.”Francis sees 2015 as an opportunity to make rugby a national alternative to football, which in turn will boost ratings and cement customer loyalty to Sky’s core offerings in the sport.In the UK, most rugby games are on pay TV, although many of the jewels in the crown remain on free-to-air channels. The main league competition, the Aviva Premiership, is split until at least 2013 between Disney’s ESPN, with 43 live games per season, and British Sky Broadcasting, with 26. Highlights are shown on ITV’s free digital channels.But Sky also shows the Heineken Cup, equivalent to football’s Champions League, which wins bigger audiences than the Premiership, albeit in a more concentrated schedule.Sky has the Anglo-Welsh Cup competition, as well as showing some level 2 matches from the Aviva Championship and broadcasting games played by England’s second XV, the Saxons. It also screens magazine shows such as The Rugby Club and the School of Hard Knocks.Not surprisingly, Paul Vaughan, the chief executive of England Rugby 2015, the delivery company set up by the Rugby Football Union for the 2015 tournament, is hopeful of a large television audience.“Through TV, rugby is delivering a shop window for the sport that will last the duration of the tournament, and hopefully beyond,” Vaughan says. He hopes ITV will do as much as possible to expose UK audiences to rugby in programming that complements the matches.At Sky, Francis adds that he believes rugby will be on the cusp of the sort of big step forward enjoyed by football in the 1990s. “I hope RWC will capture the nation a bit like Euro 96 did for football. Then, we had had five years of the Premier League and that competition [hosted by England, who reached the semi-finals] caused a real surge of appreciation after that tournament. RWC 2015 has every chance of doing that for rugby.”Sky will play its part in that effect, he says. “We don’t dismiss events we don’t broadcast. We will be broadcasting from the England camp every day on Sky Sports News. It will be good for our viewing figures across all our rugby if England win that tournament.”However, the biggest audiences are to be found with the national teams of the so-called home nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Here, free to air has the edge. The BBC last autumn renewed its deal for exclusive live rights to the RBS Six Nations championship until 2017.Sky has a slice of the international action with the October games played by England, but again the BBC has more matches, with live rights to autumn matches played by the three other home nations.Sky sweeps up the biggest internationals played outside Europe, the Tri-Nations, next season to be renamed the Rugby Championship when Argentina join Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in the first four-way tournament of southern hemisphere giants.The difference in audiences between Six Nations matches and free-to-air league fixtures is stark. The average viewing figures for BBC broadcasts in the 2010 tournament were 4.7m compared with the 80,000-90,000 that an Aviva game might attract on ESPN or Sky. Big league matches might rise to 250,000 and the Heineken Cup in its crucial stages can hit 350,000, but that cannot compare with the viewing figures for top Six Nations fixtures, up to 9m, and certainly not the World Cup.In 2003, England’s victory over Australia was probably the biggest audience ever for the sport in the UK, with a peak of more than 14m, despite being shown at 9am on a Saturday, and an audience share of 85 per cent. Four years later, as beaten finalists, England drew an average of 13.1m viewers to ITV screens, making it the single most watched programme on UK television in 2007.French TV coverage shows a similar pattern. Last year, Canal+ paid €158.5m, or €31.7m per season, in a five-year deal to televise the domestic Top 14 competition. But the state-owned France Télévisions dominate internationally, with rights to the Six Nations until 2017, most of France’s international matches abroad and the Heineken. No contract has been announced for the 2015 World Cup yet.Outside Europe, pay TV dominates in both international and domestic games. In Australia, while Channel Nine has re-entered the rugby rights race, it will still play second fiddle to News Corp’s Fox Sports, which, for instance, has exclusive live rights to the Super 15 tournament that kicks off its 2012 campaign on February 24.Meanwhile, in New Zealand, where rugby is of almost religious importance and still basks in its 2011 World Cup victory, Sky Sports is the dominant holder of rights for the domestic, Super Rugby and All Blacks matches.
396;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-23T14:14:38Z;Nike looks to Lin to net China sales;;"Nike is developing plans to use Jeremy Lin, US basketball’s newest star, to market its products in China as it tries to maintain rapid growth in a region where its annual revenues are heading towards $3bn.Mr Lin, a son of Taiwanese immigrants who has been sponsored by Nike since 2010, has gone from second-string obscurity to stardom this month by securing a series of victories for the New York Knicks.Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, told the Financial Times that the world’s biggest sporting goods maker by sales was already exploring ways to profit from its most unexpected celebrity in China.“No question. We’re developing plans as we speak,” he said. “The fact he’s experiencing the kind of success he’s having now is a very, very pleasant surprise for us.” Nike, however, declined to comment on rumours that it was working on a Lin signature shoe.The US company is seeking to benefit from the growing number of people playing sport in China, where basketball is already hugely popular as a spectator sport.State-owned media in China was at first slow to jump on the Lin story, appearing wary of his professions of devout Christianity; the ruling Communist party is officially atheist. But among ordinary fans, his popularity has soared. He now has more than 2m followers on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.Asked how Mr Lin’s Taiwanese background would affect Nike’s plans, Mr Denson said: “We’ll see. We haven’t really got that far yet. All we know is that the kids who love basketball in China relate to Jeremy Lin. You know there are certain things that transcend certain things, and sometimes sport transcends governmental boundaries.” China considers Taiwan a breakaway province.The Nike brand does not disclose its sales in China, but in its most recent quarterly results the Nike group – including the Converse and Umbro brands – said sales in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong were up 35 per cent year on year at $650m.In the past four quarters Nike’s sales in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong were $2.3bn and analysts expect its growth rate to stay high.“I’m very happy with the progress that we’re making, but still feel like we have a long way to go,” said Mr Denson. “As kids actually see sports as an opportunity to participate as opposed to just watch, then we expect to see the growth continuing.”If Nike seeks to sell Lin-branded merchandise in China it may not be alone. According to Chinese media, a small sporting goods company in Wuxi, a manufacturing hub near Shanghai, paid Rmb4,460 ($708) last year for 10-year ownership of the trademark on the player’s Chinese name, Lin Shuhao.China is also one of Nike’s three main production locations for shoes, alongside Vietnam and Indonesia.Given Mr Lin’s “relative anonymity two weeks ago”, Mr Denson admitted that it had been cheaper to sponsor him than its established US basketball stars such as LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, but he declined to comment on the terms of the deal.“It’s a great story and it’s a great opportunity for us to start to leverage and utilise Jeremy in different ways, whether it’s with the Asian-American community, whether it’s with the Asian community, or whether it’s just the basketball community.”While Mr Lin has not yet appeared in China-specific marketing, he offers tips in Nike basketball drill videos on YouTube and last year he travelled with Nike to Taiwan where he coached at basketball clinics that included one in his father’s home town.Mr Lin is not the only US basketball player making waves in China in sports marketing. Michael Jordan, a retired star, filed a suit this week in a Chinese court against Qiaodan Sports Company Limited, a Chinese footwear manufacturer, alleging unauthorised use of his name.The company’s registered name, Qiaodan, is the same as the Chinese name by which Mr Jordan has been known in China since the 1980s."

Lex’s Vincent Boland and Julia Grindell discuss the troubled outlook for the country’s domestic sports brands.
398;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-20T18:08:34Z;Chinese sportswear: Anta-gonistic Li Nings;In the race for supremacy, Anta will not be a frontrunner for long;"A fight is breaking out in China’s locker room. In a country mad about branded goods (both real and fake), the market for branded sportswear has never been more competitive. Domestic brands have been dominated until recently by Li Ning, the eponymous chain founded by the gold medal-winning Olympic gymnast. Now rival Anta is starting to eat Li Ning’s lunch. But this may be a fight as much for survival in a fickle market as for dominance of it.Li Ning tripped up when it raised prices in 2010 in the belief that it could compete with global powers such as Nike and Adidas. That may have backfired: the company has braced investors for a 7 per cent fall in 2011 sales to around Rmb9bn. Anta has been taking advantage: it said on Monday that its 2011 revenue jumped by one-fifth to Rmb9bn; net profit rose by 12 per cent.The news still saw 3 per cent shaved off Anta’s shares. That may be justified. Competition is starting to take its toll. Other than Nike and Adidas, Li Ning and Anta compete with the likes of China Dongxiang, Peak and Xtep. In addition, Chinese non-sports fashion brands have become cheaper and more ubiquitous. That has left branded sportswear chains with mountains of stock that are proving hard to shift. Anta held inventory for an average of 38 days last year. That is much better than Li Ning’s 72 days. But Li Ning is addressing the problem by aggressive discounting and rationalising distribution.In spite of Li Ning’s and Anta’s efforts to build their brands, Nike remains the biggest sportswear name in China. Li Ning has boosted its advertising spend as a proportion of revenues to 16 per cent, one-third more than Nike and one-sixth more than Anta. Anta can probably afford to catch up. Its reliance on wholesale distribution means that it has less control over its brand, but its operating margins are three-quarters higher than Nike’s. Its shares trade at a two-fifths discount to Li Ning. Recent performance suggests that this is unjustified. But Anta will not be a frontrunner in this marathon for long.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
399;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-15T21:27:14Z;Apple has incentive to worry about workers’ rights;Its scale and conspicuous brand have brought it unwelcome attention;Imagine a company generating an extra $1.5bn in sales every week compared to what it earned only a year ago – and nearly all of that coming from products that it had dreamt up from scratch within the last half decade. These were things the world didn’t know until recently that it needed.That would be like General Motors conjuring up its entire North American sales – all the Chevrolets, Cadillacs, Buicks and GMC trucks – from nothing, in the space of just a year.That gives some idea of the enormity of Apple’s recent success on the back of the iPhone and iPad. Without those inventions, it would be a struggling computer maker trying to fill the gap left by shrinking iPod sales. Instead, it is a world-beater with a share price that surged past $500 this week and didn’t stop to catch breath. It was only with the launch of the iPad that Apple’s stock market value topped that of Microsoft, a company that once seemed unassailable: it is now worth nearly twice as much.But this latest surge has consequences. When Microsoft’s sales jump on the back of new software releases, it only needs to ship more bits. Apple has an altogether different problem. In late 2010, it was shipping 1.8m shiny new iPhones and iPads a week. A year later, it had upped that weekly quota by nearly 1.5m – and still couldn’t satisfy demand.This has created one of the great historic challenges of manufacturing. The supply chain of the electronics industry, with its hub in south China, was already one of the most impressive manifestations of the forces that have brought a new, globally distributed workforce into play. But this system is now being tested in the extreme.This is not just about iPads and iPhones: with the advent of true mobile computing, an industry that once counted its sales in the hundreds of millions will soon be counting it in the billions.That makes Apple’s handling of the supply chain labour issues that continue to dog it a central concern not just for its own future but for the industry at large. Its scale and conspicuous brand have brought it unwelcome attention. But it is already ahead of its main rivals in trying to grapple with the underage labour, excessive forced overtime and inadequate safety standards that continue to be alleged against it, and the new standards it is helping to set will be felt across the industry.One implication is that costs will rise. According to one tech industry veteran who has been closely involved with supply chain labour issues in the past, Foxconn, the immense Chinese manufacturer that supplies much of Apple’s output, “clearly has optimised around cost and speed rather than worker rights”.Changing that will take money. For a company that can charge premium prices, like Apple, that may not present a problem. It is also unlikely to hurt the lowest-cost makers of consumer electronics based in the emerging world, many of which will feel no obligation to meet the new, higher, voluntary standards that are likely to emerge. But the same will not be true for consumer electronics brands based in the US or Europe: without Apple’s premium brand, they will have little price protection, but they will still need to conform to raised expectations.All of this presumes, of course, that Apple actually has the power to influence how its suppliers treat their own workers. Transparency appears to be one problem. Apple executives argue strenuously that they audit suppliers thoroughly and have identified any problems. Tim Cook, chief executive, says that he gets weekly data on the working hours put in by 500,000 workers around the world – surely giving him a far better understanding than his counterparts in the automobile industry had nearly a century ago when they first introduced mass manufacturing.Yet independent investigations – most recently one by the New York Times – continue to point to significant shortcomings.Apple’s leaders certainly have plenty of incentive to get to the root of this problem. The consequences of failing to deal with it would be significant. It is not just a question of appeasing the NGOs that make themselves a nuisance about such issues. As Nike and Reebok found a decade ago, customers can rebel against brands associated with sweatshop practices. Steve Jobs, for whom the Apple brand experience was a big part of delighting his customers, would have understood what is at stake.Of course, this could also have consequences that reach far beyond the Apple brand. Unlike the recent stream of young internet idealists who have made a show of their desire to make the world a better place – most recently Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook– Mr Jobs never set his sights beyond pleasing his customers as he sought to “put a dent in the universe”.But for Apple’s brand to thrive as it moves into its new phase of global manufacturing superpower, his heirs will have to show that their company is dedicated to the betterment of a large slice of the world’s working population.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
400;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-15T20:18:47Z;Companies right to say ‘we do’ to gay wedlock;Companies should take pride in being bolder than presidential candidates;"Just as Metternich is reputed to have marked Talleyrand’s death by saying “What did he mean by that?”, anything Lloyd Blankfein does is scrutinised for ulterior motives.The Goldman Sachs chief executive’s video supporting gay marriage has attracted scornful comment from those who think he is trying to deflect attention from excessive pay and the company’s
role in the global financial crisis.But Mr Blankfein is not alone: several large US companies have come out for same-sex marriage, including Nike and Starbucks.Their stance is probably braver than Mr Blankfein’s because they are consumer businesses that could be subject to boycott by opponents of gay rights. Goldman, doing its business with other companies, is less vulnerable. It is probably no accident that law firms, also less susceptible to consumer pressure, score higher than other types of business on the Corporate Equality Index sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign for gay, bisexual and transgender equality.Ford, a company that sells to the public, experienced a buffeting over the issue. In 2005, campaign groups headed by the American Family Association called for a boycott of the vehicle maker after it advertised in gay publications. Ford withdrew the advertisements but, faced with a counter-boycott from gay activists, changed its mind again. Today, Ford, which receives a 100 per cent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, has decided to keep quiet about gay marriage. The company says: “Ford has a long tradition of treating all with respect and we are very proud of our record on human rights. We believe this commitment to respect is far more important than taking a position on this public policy initiative.”Microsoft, which sells both to companies and consumers, has been through a similar struggle – and has reached the opposite conclusion.In 2005 it refused to take a position on the gay anti-discrimination bill then making its way through the Washington state legislature. After pressure from employees, it changed its mind and now also supports Washington’s same-sex marriage bill, which was this week signed into law.That companies are battling to decide what to do on the issue should be no surprise. Public opinion in the US, while increasingly sympathetic to gay marriage, is still deeply divided. A Pew Research Center study last year found that while opposition to same-sex marriage had fallen sharply since 1996, 46 per cent of Americans were still against it, with 45 per cent in favour. Presidential candidates have steered clear. Mitt Romney, the Republican contender, who ordered the issuing of same-sex marriage licences when he was Massachusetts governor, now says: “Marriage is between a man and a woman.” President Barack Obama says his position is still “evolving”.Why should companies, with a duty to shareholders to ensure the financial health of the business, stick their necks out on gay marriage, any more than they do on other issues Pew identified as deeply divisive, such as abortion or gun control?Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, says gay equality is a business issue. Its workforce needs to look like its customers. If the company’s home state of Washington didn’t offer same-sex marriage rights, able gay staff would prefer to live in one of the other states that did.I think there is a deeper reason. If you work with people every day, it doesn’t seem right that some of their partners benefit from their health and pension plans while others don’t. And once you accept that same-sex partners should have workplace equality, what justification can there be for denying them the legal blessing and protection available to married heterosexuals? Even if you had religious objections, how easy would you find it to defend them while looking one of your gay colleagues in the eye?This is not a universal view. Only a handful of countries recognise
gay marriage. Seventy-six countries outlaw homosexual sex, according
to a United Nations report that also describes appalling violence against gays around the world.That companies are prepared to be bolder than presidential candidates in turning this tide should be a matter of pride. Sometimes, after weighing up the rights of the company’s customers, shareholders and staff, you just have to do the right thing. Scepticism about Goldman Sachs is often in order. But on this issue, Mr Blankfein has done the right thing.michael.skapinker@ft.com"
401;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-15T15:34:40Z;Puma sales beat expectations;;Franz Koch, Puma’ chief executive, said the sports goods industry is relatively protected from austerity in Europe after the German group posted better than expected earnings and predicted a further increase this year.“We have not seen a major consumer crisis yet,” Mr Koch told the Financial Times. “There is something special to our industry – sports goods do not seem so affected by the crisis.”Puma on Wednesday forecast sales and income growth in each of the next two years, helping shares rise 2.5 per cent to €245.75. Shares in rival Adidas climbed a similar amount.Sports goods companies normally see a sales boost in years such as 2012 when popular events such as the Olympic Games and football’s European Championships spark consumer interest. Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprinter and world-record holder, is Puma’s best-known star.Reaching its sales goal for the year of €3bn ($3.9bn), Puma said net income for 2011 rose 13.8 per cent to €230m. Fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled from €14m to €33.1m, with sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up more than 8 per cent.Sales in the Americas rose almost 28 per cent compared with the same period last year. Mr Koch said Latin American sales grew quickly, but admitted Puma still had to make its performance sportswear more “relevant” to consumers in the US.Mr Koch took over as chief executive last year after longstanding predecessor Jochen Zeitz moved to a role at PPR, Puma’s French majority owner. Puma is the world’s third-largest sports goods maker by sales after Nike and Adidas.
402;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-02-06T23:40:09Z;Glam Media moves closer to IPO;;Glam Media, a large network of lifestyle blogs that has been valued at close to $1bn, is close to finalising plans to file for an initial public offering by April, at the same time as it attempts to reconfigure its business using bespoke social networks.The move closer to an IPO marks an attempt by Samir Arora, Glam’s chief executive, to grab some of the social-media halo effect created by Facebook’s upcoming flotation.“People are really the spreaders of content and Glam is a huge beneficiary of that,” says Mr Arora, a former Apple executive. “We are looking at the whole model we have and saying, how can we greatly increase the social discovery of content?”Glam declined to comment on its IPO plans, but people familiar with the situation said the company is finalising its selection of bankers this week ahead of a planned S-1 filing in March or April, with a view to floating the company in the second or third quarter of 2012. A similar line-up of investment banks to Facebook’s advisers are being considered, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, the people said.Glam is best known for fashion and entertainment sites run by small teams of enthusiasts such as BecomeGorgeous.com and GossipCenter.com, although it also represents better-known names such as former Oprah Winfrey accomplice Dr Phil.In December, Glam embarked in a new direction with the $150m acquisition of Ning, which allows people to create their own social networks.At the time of the Ning deal, Glam’s valuation was $950m. It has raised about $130m from venture capital investors to date. Glam’s annual revenues are in excess of $100m and growth remains at above 25 per cent.Its audience has grown from 1m monthly visitors in its first year to 210m in 2011, almost doubling its audience in two years, recording 2.6bn pageviews.Social networks, particularly Twitter and Facebook, are the leading source of that traffic to Glam’s network of more than 4,000 publishers and authors, which is why Mr Arora has begun what he calls the “third phase” of Glam’s development into creating its own social platform.Mr Arora says the first phase of the company when it launched in 2005 was to build a media company based on “social content” such as blogs. Glam aggregated this content together and sold advertising space around it to major brands such as Nike or H&M.In its latest phase it plans to pitch to consumers directly and encourage them to become “curators” of content through Ning-powered social networks, focused on niche interests from shoes and designer handbags to health tips and film reviews.“That’s a pretty big pivot,” Mr Arora says. “We have the audience, the ads, the content, and the social platform – now we are putting them together.”The model will be put to the test on a forthcoming new Glam “channel”, one of two or three such communities to be launched this year.

Actually, that was a joke, but you get the point.I have no idea how to answer those questions, and I am theoretically at least someone who should care about such matters. After all, in the luxury world, it’s all about the flagship, and the place where brand and consumers meet.So why is Apple different? Why do people care so much about this guy’s name?You could say it’s because Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world by market capitalisation, ergo anything it does matters, but I think it’s more complicated than that. I think it has to do with two things.First: the Apple stores are money-making machines. They generate, on average, $4,000 of sales per square foot, according to this story on Macworld.com. At a seminar recently Mickey Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, got into a “passionate discussion” with the head of a big mall group about how much malls suck. When said head of malls claimed many were doing well, Drexler said, “how many that DON’T have an Apple store as an anchor?” and the head of malls had to acknowledge that that changed the profit landscape a bit. It is because of the success of Apple’s stores, and by association, its retail guy is the guy everyone wants to watch.Second: its last head of retail, Ron Johnson, went off to run the US mass market fashion brand JC Penney, which has now got the American high street in a tizzy given his track record with the Apple stores. That position, more than any other retail post, is a marquee spot for the luxury industry, which may be why Mr Browett left the head honcho job at a UK brand for a slightly less senior job in a bigger global playground.Anyway, all the attention certainly glamourises the idea of retail operations. I wonder if there are a lot of young graduates out there suddenly seeing store science as an attractive career goal. Given the recent emphasis on the online world and the feeling that physical shops are so yesterday, this could be, yet again, a game-changer.
404;NKE;Nike Inc;2012-01-30T00:19:59Z;A tailored fit;Stanford has led the way with a personalised approach. By Della Bradshaw;"First it was all about “leadership”, then it was about “globalisation”; these days “personalisation” is the key phrase in MBA ­degrees. And the institution that arguably started the trend in this, is the graduate school of business at Stanford ­University, ranked number one in the world in the Financial Times MBA rankings for the first time this year.Much of the Californian school’s success is down to South African dean Garth Saloner, 57, who joined Stanford in 1990 and was appointed dean in 2009.He spearheaded the curriculum reform, implemented in 2007, that ­introduced compulsory overseas modules; moved away from lock-step teaching to a suite of experience-related courses; and brought in a tutorial system, novel in the US, but similar to the one at UK universities, in which faculty work with small groups of students to explore appropriate courses and careers.Studying for an MBA 20 years ago used to be like “batch processing”, says Prof Saloner. These days it is about detailed attention to the individual: “Curriculum reform moved us in a quite different direction.”Four years on, he says the biggest impact of the 2007 overhaul has come from a set of courses that layer on top of the fundamental management ones. They give, he says, “a qualitatively different education, a much richer exper­ience”. For one exercise, for example, the school brings in 200 alumni who role-play difficult scenarios with students and give feedback. There are also courses in design and innovation. All of these are taught in groups of fewer than 20 students, sometimes as few as six.Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, it is unsurprising that Stanford has a focus on innovation. But there are other reasons why it can invest so much time in each MBA student.First, it has a relatively small class for a top US school – 397 MBAs enrolled in the first year of the programme in 2011, less than half the class size of Harvard or Wharton.Second, with an endowment close to $1bn, the school is one of the wealth­iest in the world.Phil Knight, a 1962 graduate and the founder and chairman of Nike, the sporting goods group, gave $105m to the business school in 2006, to support the building of a new campus. At the time, it was the largest ever donation to a business school.It led to the opening of the Knight Management Center in 2011, an eight-building complex. The buildings were designed to ­support the person­alised curriculum, including multiple break-out rooms for group work and small-group tutoring.“I think we have a very clear view of our positioning and there’s definitely tremendous demand,” says Prof Sal­oner. “We’re getting first-rate people.”These days the careers service follows a similar policy of personalisation. “There was a change in strategy a few years ago. It was not something we had planned, but we have moved to a personalised approach to placement,” concedes the dean. “We are quite consciously driving a personalised process through the whole [school],” he adds.Career services are no longer about shoehorning individuals into the traditional management consultancies and banks, he says. “In terms of placement, our students are really extremely thoughtful about how they want to craft lifetime careers. It’s a very individual process.”It is all about “career-life visioning”, he says, in an unusual lapse into management-speak. “They don’t feel compelled to have a job in hand on graduation. They’re finding their paths. They have a lot of choice.”For a school that prides itself on educating students who give back – the opening of the Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies in 2011 is testament to that – it is perhaps ironic that it also educates the students who financially benefit the most from their MBAs, and have done so for a number of years. For the 2012 FT rankings, the alumni that graduated from Stanford in 2008 report that they currently earn an average of $191,657, which is 8 per cent higher than their peers from Harvard. It is this salary premium that is largely responsible for Stanford’s move to the top of the rankings this year.Like most business schools these days, Stanford’s mantra is that it creates leaders to make the world a better place. On the evidence so far, it may be on track to do this better than most.On Wednesday February 1, 2012, between 14.30 and 15.30 GMT, Garth Saloner will join the FT Ask the Experts panel to answer your question on studying for an MBA.

But investors now warn that more progress is needed on economic reform and industrial relations if that trend is to continue.An emphasis on breakneck growth and the channelling of cheap credit and resources to wasteful state-owned companies has also left Vietnam with persistently high inflation, which threatens to undermine the country’s appeal to manufacturers.There were 857 strikes in the first 11 months of 2011, when annual inflation averaged over 18 per cent, according to government figures released to the state media. That is more than double the number of strikes in 2010 and more than in 2008, the previous record year for strikes, when inflation peaked at 28 per cent.“This is a very worrying number,” Nguyen Thien Nhan, a deputy prime minister, told a government conference on the issue earlier this month, according to state media. “We need to research whether or not this is a new trend and whether it is localised or nationwide.”Wages for unskilled factory workers in Vietnam remain considerably lower than in China, around $100 a month compared to $300, according to factory managers.Those low wage levels have helped Communist-ruled Vietnam attract a growing number of cost-conscious international manufacturers including Canon, the Japanese electronics company, Intel, the US chip producer and hundreds of predominantly Taiwanese and South Korean manufacturers producing shoes and garments for international apparel brands such as Nike.But wages have recently been rising sharply in Vietnam, particularly in industries that require workers with more experience.Some companies had to increase salaries on four occasions last year to stave off strikes, and the government raised the minimum wage in key industrial areas to 2,000,000 Vietnam dong ($95) in August, an increase of up to 49 per cent.“Manufacturing companies are squeezed on both sides, by buyers that are squeezing down product prices and workers that are constantly demanding more money because of the rising cost of living,” says Jonathan Pincus, who heads Harvard University’s economics teaching programme in Ho Chi Minh City.Strikes are one of the major current concerns of Japanese manufacturers, who run many of Vietnam’s biggest and most technologically advanced factories, according to Hirokazu Yamaoka, the chief representative of Japan’s trade promotion body in Hanoi. Dozens of Japanese companies were hit by walkouts last year, he says, despite attempts to head off discontent with pre-emptive wage rises.The rising tide of labour strikes also represent a serious political challenge, in authoritarian, one-party Vietnam, where the weak, government-controlled Vietnam General Confederation of Labour is the only legal trade union and workers who try to organise strikes independently face arrest or other sanctions.Foreign diplomats and factory bosses say the government is caught in a bind between the need to develop better communication channels between workers and employers, and its fears that organised labour may become a threat to political stability.“The government is faced with a big problem in how to address these strikes,” says Youngmo Yoon, who works on industrial relations at the International Labour Organisation in Hanoi. “If the disputes and strikes do not take place in an orderly and regular manner, there’s the potential for these strikes to spread and take on political aspects, which is what the government fears a lot.”He says that the VGCL is not being pushed hard enough by the government to take on the challenge of representing workers, in contrast to the equivalent official body in neighbouring China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.“The key difference between Vietnam and China is that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is being pushed by the Communist party to take on the work of representing workers and controlling the situation,” says Mr Yoon.Although they are not typically supporters of enhanced labour rights, some factory managers in Vietnam also want to see stronger worker representation to ensure better lines of communication.“Our workers went on strike after their rice portions were cut by the catering contractor who was trying to save money because of inflation,” says one European factory manager. But because the official trade union was not acting as an effective communication channel, the company had no way of knowing about the problem until it was too late, he says.

My grandfathers were a paediatrician and a self-made multimillionaire. I inherited the former’s value system and the latter’s entrepreneurial skills.Why did you set up Kids Company?As a psychotherapist, I met young children who were terrified by school holidays. They saw school as a sanctuary. So I set up centres to look after them.What caused the London riots?They were not a surprise. There are 1.5m children being abused and neglected in Britain. They live in unsafe environments, constantly feel frightened, yet have scant possibility of escape through meaningful employment. The children can’t do anything. The adult world has to. But the government won’t address the issue because children don’t have the vote.Does that justify theft?The narrative was that the nation is greedy. People made great show of children lusting for Nike trainers. It’s the adult world that produces these products, runs the advertising campaigns, tells everyone that these are must-haves, then puts them at unaffordable prices. We’ve arrived at a point when the human being is the commodity. It’s not what people do, it’s what they look like. Children are demonised while the adults, who created the products and the culture, and do the demonising, get knighthoods.What can be done?These children have no effective parents. The government needs to step in and care for them at an early stage. By “caring” I mean robust boundaries that deliver solutions. Kids Company puts resources in and gets about 97 per cent of high-risk kids back into education and employment.So charities are more effective?Social innovation happens predominately through charities because they can innovate solutions that match problems. The next step is that these social innovations are picked up by the mainstream.What would you like to see change in the charity world?We’re veering towards donors deciding what charity’s clinical output should be. An industry is evolving to measure charities’ performance and dictate policy. This is dangerous. I’m all for accountability, but the measurements must be well thought out. Charity-monitoring organisations need to gain the humility to understand that analysis based on a business-oriented world-view is very limited.Should the head of a charity earn £100,000 plus?I don’t take that kind of salary, and don’t expect that any vocational charity worker’s value system would demand it. However, some charities have become like corporate companies and a different type of chief executive is needed.howtogiveit@ft.com
407;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Twitter turns up heat on ambitions;;The arrival last week of media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Twitter was a symbolic moment for the five-year-old company. The quickfire nature of its 140-character updates has already won over many reporters. After overhauling the design and features of its homepage and mobile apps, Twitter is now gently turning up the heat on its ambitions as an advertising business.“Twitter is more of a journalistic than a marketing phenomenon,” says Mark Read, chief executive of WPP Digital, the advertising group. “If you talk to newspaper editors and people in the media, they are obsessed.”By contrast, Twitter is “still trying to figure out” its advertising products, Mr Read says.Marketers spent an estimated $100m-$150m on Twitter advertising to reach its 100m users last year, compared with forecasts of nearly $4bn for Facebook and its 800m users.“For the right category of marketers – those that involve entertainment properties, personalities, launches and news, those that have their own content or sponsor events – it’s pretty relevant,” Mr Read says. “But it requires a greater degree of sophistication than other forms of online advertising. It’s harder to evaluate its impact.”So far, Twitter’s advertisers have been prepared to pay $1 to $4 for each new follower through “promoted accounts”, though some – such as carmakers – are bidding more than $10. “Promoted tweets”, which make brands’ marketing messages more likely to be seen by more users, are charged based on “engagement”, such as the number of replies or “retweets”.That commercial model is hard to fit into a typical online media-buying plan which tends to revolve around clicks and impressions, says Simon Mansell, chief executive of TBG Digital, a social marketing specialist. “It’s not really simple for an ad buyer to make a purchase.”Twitter needs to grow its revenues rapidly to meet the expectations of its investors who have valued the privately-held company at $8bn.Adam Bain, Twitter’s head of revenue, says: “Twitter the product is five years old, [but] Twitter the business is just slightly over a year old. We’ve done a lot in a short amount of time …Our motto has been to do it right, rather than do it right away.”Only a “handful” of people worked in Twitter’s advertising department when he arrived in September 2010, but now more than 100 are employed in cities such as London and Tokyo, and it is hiring fast.The slow rollout of ads has helped to keep engagement rates much higher than other online formats – low-single-digit percentages of people seeing a sponsored tweet interact with it, compared with a fraction of 1 per cent for Facebook or standard display ads.“The engagement rate on ads is probably the highest I’ve ever seen on any digital advertising that I’ve run in the last 10 years,” says Mr Mansell at TBG Digital.Last month, Twitter began allowing some existing advertisers to use a self-service portal to buy ads. That move in itself was significant because Twitter’s first forays into advertising were with only a handful of carefully selected big brands, such as Starbucks and Paramount Pictures.Today, Twitter has run campaigns from a total of 3,000 brands, with Nike recently launching a new branded @Nike account. Twitter has commitments from some large brands to spend $2m in 2012, according to one source.In recent weeks, “handpicked” smaller advertisers have been brought on board, as long as they know the right people and can meet the $15,000 per month minimum spend.“I got an intro to one of their account managers, over Twitter appropriately enough,” says Damien Tanner, co-founder of Pusher, a real time messaging start-up. “I got the account up and running within a day. I only had to send them a few details. I was very impressed.”While Mr Tanner says his campaigns have been successful in attracting new followers, the overall return on that investment is not obvious. “I don’t have enough data to work out how much I can pay for a follower.”Mr Bain at Twitter said that advertisers “keep coming back for more” after starting to use its ads, but he adds: “Often they need help with ideas, they need help with best practices.”Other advertisers contacted by the Financial Times, who did not wish to speak publicly, gave Twitter and its products mixed reviews, raving about high response rates but describing the advertising system as “limited” and the company as “confusing to work with”.“We were struggling at first with Promoted Tweets but what we discovered is you have to got to be very timely and very current,” says Paul Smith, managing director of Techlightenment, a social marketing agency.Buying ads around phrases linked into live “event TV” such as X Factor or sports games was most successful, he says.“The level of activity and interest on the part of our followers is greater than any other channel,” says Anita Newton, vice-president of retail and digital marketing at AMC Theatres, a cinema owner. For some ad industry veterans, abandoning traditional click-based metrics is no bad thing.“Twitter has the opportunity to disrupt the media business with meaningful new formats, rather trying to retrofit the old ad model,” says Ajaz Ahmed, chairman of AKQA, a large digital agency. “The combination of scale, immediacy and real-time analytics provides an ideal platform for monetisation.”
408;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-21T21:49:49Z;Oracle earnings miss spurs sector sell-off;;"An earnings miss by Oracle sent software stocks tumbling on fears that large business customers are taking longer to close orders.Oracle fell 11.6 per cent to $25.77 after revenues grew just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast.Richard Davis, of Canaccord Genuity, stripped Oracle of its “buy” rating, saying: “Oracle will have to rebuild confidence that the firm is not headed to Microsoft’s valuation level [seven times earnings] over the next few years.”But other analysts blamed the miss on delayed purchases by corporate customers, which would affect software stocks more widely.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund, who maintained a “buy” rating on Oracle.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 4.9 per cent to $39.90, now down 16.2 per cent for the week.Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 5.1 per cent to $99.03.Citrix systems fell 7.8 per cent to $58.46 as Citigroup analysts said it was among the most exposed to the possibility of “non-recurring software orders” from businesses.That left the Nasdaq Composite index reeling. The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
409;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;China’s brand copycats go public;;"How do Chinese companies make their products stand out in an ultra competitive market? For at least two of them, the answer lies in other people’s brands.Qiaodan is a sportswear maker based in southeastern China which has just received approval for an equity listing in Shanghai. The family-controlled company with sales of Rmb2.9bn ($460m) last year has become one of the country’s top 10 domestic sports apparel companies by revenue and number of outlets, despite its relatively short 11-year history.Well, 11 years of trading under the Qiaodan brand, at least. It started life in the 1980s as Fujian Province Jinjiang Township Chendi Brookside General Supplies Factory Number Two. No wonder it changed its name.In 2000, it reinvented itself as Qiaodan, the Chinese name given to Michael Jordan, the legendary US basketball star who has a massive fan base in the country – despite the fact that Qiaodan is also the name used in China by Nike for its range of “Air Jordan” shoes and apparel. Any idea that this is mere coincidence can be dispelled by a glance at the Chinese company’s logo: a silouette of a basketball player more than a little reminiscent of Nike’s “Jumpman” logo inspired by Jordan’s famous dunk.Qiaodan points out in its listing documents that it is a purely homegrown Chinese brand and has received no endorsement from either Nike or Jordan. Local media say Nike has complained to the Chinese government in the past but its case was blocked by the state trademark office.In developed markets, using a logo similar to somebody else’s registered one is enough to get you into deep trouble. But not, clearly, in mainland China.Here is another example.Chinese Lifestyle Food & Beverages, a company which sells snacks under the “Crayon Shin-chan” brand, raised just under $100m in an initial public offering in Hong Kong this month. Crayon Shin-chan, or Labixiaoxin in Mandarin, is a well-known Japanese cartoon character which became popular in China during the 1990s when it was dubbed and shown on television.Chinese Lifestyle F&B acknowledges that it has not received permission from the Japanese publishing house that owns the character to make money from it but stated confidently in its prospectus that it didn’t expect to get into trouble. Official “Crayon Shin-chan” products endorsed by the Japanese publishing house display the Chinese characters Labixiaoxin horizontally, whereas the Chinese snackmaker displayed the characters vertically, it said.Like Nike, there seems little the Japanese company can do. It tried to block a Chinese eyewear maker from registering the Labixiaoxin brand under its name in 2005 but its case was rejected by a Beijing court.The eyewear maker doesn’t appear to have made a fuss over the snackmaker’s use of the brand name, either. Which just goes to show that the issue of copyright in one of the world’s most important consumer markets is still very murky indeed.Related reading:

410;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
411;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-21T00:00:53Z;Production costs squeeze Nike margins;;Nike, the US sporting goods group, reported strong growth in sales and a modest rise in earnings that beat market expectations even as its profit margin fell due to higher costs.Net earnings rose by 3 per cent to $469m on sales that grew 18 per cent to $5.7bn in the three months to November 30, thanks in large part to the continued strength of its North America business, Nike said on Tuesday.Nike has set itself apart from many peers by continuing to grow rapidly in the US in spite of the country’s weak economy at the same time as it and others expand at a heady pace in emerging markets.Nike’s diluted earnings per share came in at $1.00, ahead of the consensus forecast of $0.97, and its stock rose 1.9 per cent to $95.44 in after-market trading once the results were released.However, the company’s gross margin – a key industry measure of profitability – declined by 260 basis points to 42.7 per cent, a fall that Nike attributed to higher production costs.Nike said the higher costs had “more than offset” its initiatives to trim overheads and the company’s success in passing higher commodity costs on to consumers.Some analysts had forecast an increase in expenses as Nike ramps up spending ahead of the Olympics in London next year and the Euro 2012 football tournament.In North America, the company’s biggest division, sales climbed 21 per cent to $2.1bn and in greater China they rose 35 per cent, excluding foreign exchange effects, to $650m.The only region where revenues fell was Japan, where they dropped 7 per cent.
412;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-16T17:13:33Z;Costing the dream: Struq;Online advertising business started with next to nothing;"Sam Barnett, chief executive of online marketing company StruqStruq is a near-perfect lesson in how to launch a company with next to nothing. It is an advertising technology business that personalises online ads – and it was founded by Sam Barnett in April 2008 with just £2,000.Barnett, a former commercial lawyer, had been paid this sum for drafting a legal contract for AdJug, the online advertising exchange. While it might not have been much – “it wasn’t the best way to start a company”, he laughs – it was enough.A law degree from Leicester University had initially led him to a position in the legal department of Espotting Media, the pay-per-click advertising pioneer that is now part of Miva. There, his job had involved drafting and reviewing commercial contracts.After a year, however, Barnett decided that the legal profession was not for him. Advertising held more appeal. “I realised that, if I wanted to be involved in advertising, then it had to be doing something operational. So I began doing business development for Espotting across Europe and then joined AdJug.”It soon became clear to Barnett that display advertising “was generic, irrelevant communication – someone created a message and then pushed it out to the masses”. He felt the trick was to make that message better and prioritise it – so that the communication became relevant. What it meant in practice was personalising the advert.Barnett says the concept is simple – even if the underlying algorithms are not. “Our primary product is something called Personalised Retargeting [sic],” he explains. “When a user goes to a clothes site and looks at a pair of jeans, doesn’t buy them, leaves the site and goes to an online newspaper, we then show them an ad that contains those jeans, as well as a T-shirt and shoes that match. We recommend other products they might be interested in.”This call to action, as he terms it, is effective. “It is likely to persuade the user to click and buy that product. Every £1 an advertiser spends with us generates £19 in revenue, because of people clicking and buying through our ads.”Trying to start Struq with just £2,000 was not quite so easy, though.Year 1 - ActualYear 2 - ActualYear 3 - ActualYear 4 - ForecastYear 5 - ForecastThe solution? “I didn’t spend money on anything,” says Barnett. “Cash flow was king. When we needed a place to work, I said to my old company that if I consulted for a day a week, would they give us free space and pay us? So we got free office space and free internet connection. I learnt how to build a website, so I built one at no cost. If you don’t have anything, then you have to do substantially more with less. You have to work a lot harder, get new skills and deliver results in a very short amount of time.”With little time and even less money, Barnett was in a hurry – not least to reach profitability.“I decided that, in the next five months, we would have to make enough money so we could pay people – which is what we did. It was a bit like playing the stock market. We used new technology to arbitrage search networks and then we got to the stage where we had cash flow.”But surely the technology must have cost money? Not a penny, Barnett claims. “We built our technology in the most lean and agile way. We did everything not to spend money in those early days – to save cash and get the right people on board to realise our vision.”Saving cash also involved cutting his own salary: he paid himself just £7,000 for the first year. A colleague – Steve Pereira, now head of operations – learnt to program in Flash over the weekend. “He turned up to work on Monday having built a video in Flash. That was an example of our
culture where people did not mess around, but took ownership of stuff. We started with very little, but we were enormously resourceful.”At times, their early resourcefulness was reminiscent of an Ealing comedy. “We used old doors as desks,” Barnett says. “We didn’t spend money on furniture – we found our office chairs in the street.”Soon, this furniture became fungible. “We traded it with the guys on the fourth floor for a bin and a couple of fans,” he recalls. “A chair we found was traded to use their internet connection, so we ran a cable out of the fourth floor down to the second – but when it rained, the water ran down the cable on to all the laptops.”Frantic rounds of cold-calling paid off, and Jobsite became Struq’s first client.Now, the business has 150 clients in 19 countries – including Nike, Adidas and Top Shop – and its staff of 45 is expected to grow to 70 by February next year.Further growth is expected – not least because of the $8m Barnett expects to raise in a fundraising round that ends in January.“We will expand very aggressively internationally,” he says. “We will increase our product range and we will open offices in the US, Germany and France – and we are considering one or two other European territories.”Ultimately, Barnett wants to retain the lean, keen mentality of the start-up – “we have been a bootstrap business,” he points out – as the company grows.Having launched into the teeth of the recession in 2008, Barnett feels he was forced build an efficient business.“We had to innovate faster, work harder, be smarter – and have products that provided exceptional results,” he says.“Those qualities remain with us today and I am really determined that we should not lose those qualities of innovation.“Our DNA was a result of like-minded people whose only option was to work like this, otherwise we wouldn’t have survived.”"
413;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-14T01:24:19Z;Jive IPO: Are businesses ready for Facebook-esque employee networks?;;Jive Software’s successful debut on the Nasdaq on Tuesday reflects investor enthusiasm for social media companies, though it is unclear how eager businesses are to bring a Facebook-style network to the workplace.Jive provides social software to businesses, including customised social networks for customers, and internal networks and collaboration tools for employees. After pricing its shares at $12 on Monday, it traded as high as $16.50 on Tuesday, a 38 per cent jump, closing at $15.05, giving the 10-year old company a valuation of more than $662m.“It lends credibility that the new way to work is here,” said Tony Zingale, Jive’s chief executive.Following the massive consumer adoption of Facebook, more than 100 companies began developing similar social networking capabilities for businesses. Today, Jive, along with rivals Lithium, Microsoft and salesforce.com are the main providers of such technology.Rather than connecting friends who share information about parties and break-ups, these networks are aimed at helping employees find experts within a company and improving workplace efficiency.Though Jive boasts close to 700 customers, including large brands like Nike, Fidelity, Avon, and T-Mobile, it also acknowledges in its IPO filing that the market for social business software is in the very early stages and widespread adoption is uncertain.“The adoption curve is not at its peak yet,” said Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “There is still more growth to be had.”With annual contracts reaching $300,000 to $500,000 per client, Jive generated revenues of $54.8m in the first nine months of 2011. It recorded a net loss of $38.1m for the same time period, and said it did not expect to be profitable “in the foreseeable future.”But Mr Zingale is confident that the company will continue to grow, particularly as large brands look outside of Facebook in search of more customised networking sites built on platforms like Jive’s.“The Facebook Page is generic,” he said. “It doesn’t serve the needs of intimacy in the Nike+ runners’ community or the T-Mobile community.”He said brands will maintain their Facebook presence for marketing purposes, but will shift engagement with customers to their own branded network where they have more control and can foster more interaction between and among customers.In addition to raising funds to support expansion in Asia and South America and make acquisitions, Mr Zingale said he hoped the IPO would raise awareness among businesses that have not heard of Jive and inspire them to become new clients.
414;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-12T12:53:23Z;Vietnam gamer relives Dien Bien Phu;;"Vietnam’s best-known exports are probably rice, coffee and Nike shoes but one software developer hopes to start changing that with the international release of a Vietnamese shoot-em-up computer game early next year.Nguyen Tuan Huy of Emobi Games claims “7554″, set during the war of independence against France in 1946-54, is the first major video game produced by a Vietnamese developer.The game is named in commemoration of 7 May 1954, the day the Vietnamese army – which had evolved from a band of guerrillas under the leadership of general Vo Nguyen Giap – finally overran the French positions at the battle of Dien Bien Phu.At a time when many economists and analysts are fretting about how Vietnam can move from low-cost manufacturing to a more knowledge-based economy, Huy is one of a handful of Vietnamese tech entrepreneurs leading the way.The country’s budding tech sector has already attracted interest, with eBay taking a 20 per cent stake in a Vietnamese trading website and DeNA, a Japanese mobile gaming company, acquiring a Hanoi game studio this year.With little prior experience in computer games, it took Huy and his team of young developers three years to develop 7554, which resembles popular Western shoot-em-ups like Medal of Honor.It cost 17bn Vietnam dong ($817,000) to develop 7554, which Huy provided himself. Given the prevalence of software piracy in Vietnam, he is not hopeful of breaking even, which would require 100,000 sales.Overseas sales, however, would certainly help. He is targeting the US and Japan initially although a cheap price tag of $12. That is in proportion to the international limitations of the game, with English subtitles but only Vietnamese dialogue and no online gaming option.While multi-player online gaming is incredibly popular in Communist-ruled Vietnam, Emobi did not develop this option as it judged that it be would be too politically sensitive to allow local gamers to take on the role of the French army and “kill” Vietnamese soldiers.Other differences with similar games include the more limited weapons options, which, he says, is designed to better reflect the reality of combat led by a people’s army.Emobi Games has submitted 7554 to Steam, a leading US digital distribution platform for games. Huy is waiting to hear whether it will be accepted.He hopes the game will establish Emobi’s reputation and help it develop more profitable forays into the fast-growing online gaming market.“Vietnam has a domestic computer game and online gaming market of $150m,” Huy says. “The overseas market also has good potential for us but we need more creative ideas and technical knowledge.”Related reading:

415;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-02T13:14:12Z;China brands: stand up and be counted?;;"Many Chinese companies trying to build a global brand have chosen to keep quiet about one thing: where they come from. The ‘Made in China’ label is just too closely associated with cheap, low-quality goods and health and safety scandals to make it an asset.But silence is the wrong strategy, says a report by Calling Brands, a UK consultancy.Based on interviews with almost 1,500 consumers in the UK, France and Germany, the report released on Wednesday concludes that Chinese brands could do much better in Europe if they were more open about where and how their goods are made:Our research suggests that the big opportunity for genuinely pioneering Chinese brands is to use their provenance and be a standard bearer for Brand China – to show people what China is really made of.Which is all well and good, but the negative associations of Chinese brands sound fairly tricky to overcome.“Working practices and principles played a major part in why people either wouldn’t consider buying Chinese brands or were unable to give a strong view one way or the other; the same applies to performance on hygiene factors such as price, quality and reliability,” the report says. “Over a third of people surveyed said they would never or rarely consider buying Chinese brands, and put this down mainly to concerns about working practices.”It points out that the overwhelming picture for most respondents is a lack of information about Chinese brands.While there is an enormous amount of media attention to complaints or suspicions about problems with labour standards or environmental impact at factories that serve well-established multinational consumer product companies such as Apple or Nike, there is little indication that such public attention is doing permanent damage to those brands.For Chinese brands, it’s exactly the opposite. There are few concrete details available about their individual manufacturing process, but consumers abroad tend to harbour general suspicions.According to the Calling Brands report, the only attributes European consumers associate positively with Chinese brands are low price, being international and being ambitious – the factors that count least when consumers build an emotional bond to a brand.On the most important attributes, on the other hand, Chinese brands still rate shockingly low – only 3 per cent of respondents considered them reliable, 2 per cent high quality, 16 per cent good value and 2 per cent trustworthy. Consumers’ overall feelings for a country’s brands will have an impact on how the brands fare in the individual categories. German brands, for example, beat Chinese by about 5 percentage points in the ‘good value’ category despite their vastly higher prices.But there is hope: 21 per cent more respondents see Chinese brands as reliable now than did 5 years ago, and 31 per cent more think of them as high quality. However, this is from such a low starting point that it represents just a handful of respondents.And Chinese brands may have vastly better chances if they pick their markets. While French and German consumers harbour strong suspicions against Chinese brands, UK consumers are the most open to foreign brands in general and the least negatively prejudiced against Chinese goods, according to the report.So if you are a Chinese brand willing to go against one-third of your potential market, the UK is probably the best place to start.Related reading:

416;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-12-01T22:47:57Z;Corporate logos get under consumers’ skin;Some customers are branding themselves;When Steve Jobs died earlier this year, Paul Talbot, a tattoo artist and graphic designer in the Midlands, decided to commemorate his passing.“I’m a huge Apple fanboy and I run a tattoo studio, so I had an Apple logo tattooed on my foot,” he says. “My wife Karen had one on her ankle.”Mr Talbot chose the company’s 1976-98 rainbow logo and says he went as far as to ensure the font he used to write “R.I.P.” under the Apple was the one used by the company in the 1980s.Mr Talbot is not alone in decorating his skin with the Cupertino-based company’s trademark. Terry Johnston, a freelance photographer in Michigan, had a modern Apple logo inked on to his wrist in 2005. He too describes himself as an aficionado. “I’ve been an Apple loyalist for years,” he says. “I’ve grown up working with [Apple devices]. The tattoo gets a lot of attention and even though I have others, it’s the one people always comment on.”Mr Johnston is in the process of having his arms covered in what tattooists describe as “sleeves”, but the Apple on his wrist will remain the only logo. “Some of my older tattoos will be covered up. But I’ve said, ‘You can’t go over the Apple logo. You have to work round it’,” he says.Not many brands inspire this kind of devotion. Harley-Davidson, Apple and Nike are among those that people regularly ink on to their skin.A quick Google search will reveal other examples such as Microsoft Windows, Google, Facebook Dell and some designer logos, but these are relatively rare.“People get tattoos for three reasons: love, loyalty and bravado,” says Amy Krakow, author of The Total Tattoo Book and founder of New York-based Propaganda Marketing Communications.“If you’re an Apple fan, you own a computer that has only 8 per cent of the market. Apple is also the most emotional brand in the world. So you have love and loyalty there.”For Harley-Davidson, another much tattooed brand, the motivators are similar, even if the demographic is very different. “A lot of bikers got them when tattoos were very out of favour. Harley tattoos play to love, loyalty and bravado too,” she adds.And the online casino Goldenpalace.com paid Karolyne Smith of Utah to have its name tattooed on her forehead in what was undoubtedly a highly successful publicity stunt.Social changes have also propelled growth in the popularity of branded body art. Tattoos have become far more widespread and acceptable than 20 years ago. “I know a lot of tattooists who’ve made so much they’ve retired,” says Ms Krakow.On the corporate side, people also now identify more closely with brands, in a way that they might once have identified with religions or groups or organisations such as the armed forces.Ms Krakow adds that tattoos often signify a rite of passage: “If you’re a member of the US marines, you get a ‘Semper Fi’ tattoo . . . so if you’ve made a fortune in an IPO, you might get a logo tattoo.”Cory Doctorow, the blogger and science-fiction author, had a “sad Mac” tattooed on a bicep to commemorate a marathon seven-day data recovery effort.Still, there are pitfalls. Corporate tattoos age: any MySpace and Windows XP tattoos are almost certainly looking a little passé.As Ms Krakow points out: “If you’re working for a company, it might not seem such a good idea when you change jobs.”Also, people’s feelings about brands change.Still, there is a long tradition of altering tattoos. As Scott Perry, a branding expert, puts it: “You could always change the RIP under the Apple symbol to read RIP OFF.”
417;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Dunstone backs mall built of ship containers;;Carphone Warehouse chief Charles Dunstone has emerged as a secret backer behind an innovative scheme to use freight containers to create a new London retail hub.In a private investment for the multimillionaire retailer, Mr Dunstone has helped fund Boxpark, a temporary shopping mall in east London built from old shipping containers.The 60-unit development, due to be launched this weekend, is largely pre-let and has attracted a wide spectrum of retailers, including Calvin Klein, Nike and Levi’s.In spite of having the type of tenants found in malls across the UK, the lease structure of Boxpark is unusual, with lease agreements lasting a maximum of five years and some running for as few as 12 months.In addition to the flexible leases, the rent of each container, which costs about £10,000 to buy second hand, is lower than the equivalent amount of floor space in a shop.The developers of the project hope the flexibility of the leases and low rents will attract small designers and fashion brands making their first transition from studio to shop.“It is an edgy and cosmopolitan area of London, so we are not going to be competing with the established shopping centres but offering an alternative way to shop,” said Mark Phillipson at Briant Champion Long, leasing agents for the scheme.Mr Phillipson added that Boxpark, which is built on an old railway goods yard in Shoreditch, brought retail to an area of London that had missed out on the last development boom.“Areas like this are going to have to wait until the economy picks up before they are going to get serious re-development,” he added.The area is well established on London’s fashion map, with Brick Lane and Spitalfields markets a stone’s throw away. In close proximity to Old Street’s “Silicon Roundabout”, retailers hope they can tap into the spending power of bright young things working at hundreds of digital start-up businesses in the area.Boxpark is keen to expand the number of units on the site and is negotiating with tenants and the local authorities to add more containers to the mall. It is also in talks to launch similar schemes elsewhere.
418;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-11-28T13:35:03Z;China bans ads in TV drama and films;;China has banned advertisements during dramas and movies on television in the Communist party’s latest move to assert control over the country’s increasingly commercial media industry.The rules, which come into effect in January, ban TV stations from running ads during films and drama episodes that run for 45 minutes or more. Analysts said they could slow the world’s fastest-growing big advertising market next year, as the party’s media campaign starts to have a commercial impact, or divert TV ad budgets to other media.The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, an arm of the propaganda department, has over the past two years stepped up its meddling in TV networks’ operations. In 2010, it cut the amount of commercials stations could broadcast in prime time by a quarter. This year, it has pushed networks to cut entertainment programming in favour of morally edifying shows.Earlier this year, the regulator forced Hunan TV, China’s most commercially successful provincial broadcaster, to take “Supergirl”, the nation’s first and most successful talent show, off the air. Officials told the broadcaster that entertainment should take a back seat to “values, responsibility and quality”.In a key policy document passed last month, the Communist party pledged “cultural system reform” and said it wanted both to have market forces drive the media industry and for the party to control it.The regulator explained its latest move with the desire to implement the leadership’s decision, and “to fully utilise the TV networks to build a public cultural service system, raise the quality of public cultural services and guarantee the people’s basic cultural rights”.Analysts said the new rules could throw the industry into disarray. Zhao Yihe, head of research at Charm Communications, one of China’s leading advertising agencies, said they were “not going to be a lethal blow” to TV stations, but that they would hurt their ability to make money.“I expect this to shave one or two percentage points off the growth rate of TV advertising next year, which we originally forecast to be about 15 per cent,” said Mr Zhao. GroupM, the world’s largest media investment management group, predicts that China’s television ad spending will hit Rmb201bn ($31.4bn) this year, up 13 per cent from last year.However, Seth Grossman, managing director of Carat China, said the Aegis-owned media agency had not changed its 11.8 per cent growth forecast for the whole Chinese ad market in 2012 because advertisers were likely to move money to other Chinese media.“The first impact will be on [TV ad] pricing. China is still a very high demand environment, and that’s a classic inflationary pressure. This doesn’t take money out of the Chinese advertising market. It will go elsewhere,” he said, predicting benefits for local television channels, online video outlets and outdoor advertising companies.Domestic companies are the biggest spenders on Chinese TV ads, but some foreign brands like Nike, Toyota, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Sony are also present. Mr Zhao said the new regulations would create short term chaos as TV networks renegotiate advertising slots that were auctioned off as recently as this month.“It is said that the TV networks are now considering to shorten the length of one episode from the original 60 minutes to 30 minutes, and then commercials can be broadcast between those!” wrote Bi Yantao, director of the advertising faculty at Hainan University, on his microblog.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York

One of a new wave of socially concerned centre-right leaders in Latin America, he has an approval rating of 67 per cent, the economy is growing at about 5 per cent and the country’s guerrilla groups are on the back foot.Elected in a landslide victory in 2010, Mr Santos’s ambitious reform agenda has won Colombia plaudits from regional leaders, investors and rating agencies, even if Bogotá critics sometimes snipe that his government has a Nike “Lets Do It” approach: long on style, short on substance.
420;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-11-18T07:01:55Z;Chinese workers protest against wage cuts;;Thousands of workers have returned to work at a shoe factory in the southern Chinese industrial city of Dongguan, amid allegations of police brutality to quell their protests on Thursday.At least 2,000 workers demonstrated outside the shoe factory over the sacking of middle managers and the suspension of overtime, which in effect cut wages. The factory is owned by the Taiwanese company Pou Chen, which makes shoes for brands such as Nike and Adidas.Workers said the firings were related to a drop in orders at the factory and a decision by management to move jobs to another factory in the inland province of Jiangxi.Factories in southern China are struggling because of rising labour costs over the past year, and a collapse in orders from Europe since the third quarter as the eurozone debt crisis has dragged on.Earlier this week, Zhu Xiaodan, Guangdong’s acting governor, said the province, which accounts for a quarter of China’s trade, had recorded a drop in exports of about 9 per cent in October because of a collapse in orders from Europe. He said that contrasted with the growth of imports and exports of 26 per cent in the first half of the year.As labour costs have risen by double-digit rates this year, many companies have moved production from southern China to south-east Asia and China’s inland provinces.Geoffrey Crothall of the China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based workers advocacy group, said he expected more labour unrest as other manufacturers shifted production.“It’s going to be tricky convincing workers [in Guangdong] to move inland,” said Mr Crothall, who added that many young migrants preferred living in Guangdong’s bustling cities. “It’s pot luck where the relocation happens. Will workers have to sign new contracts if they are moved inland?”About 19 workers were detained by police and later released, according to internet reports. Several posted photographs online of beatings they had sustained in the protests.A reporter covering the protests for Southern Daily, a Guangzhou newspaper, wrote in a blog about overhearing a conversation between a child and his injured father.“Why didn’t you call the police after being beaten?’” the child asked. The father told his child he was beaten by police, the reporter said.Pou Chen fired 18 middle level managers and workers in late October, one of the factors that prompted the protest. One of the factory managers who lost his job wrote in a blog that the company had promoted him as recently as July.“I have won awards every month. I love my factory and my family works here too,” he wrote in a post late last month.Pou Chen did not respond to queries about the protests.Additional reporting by Zhou Ping in Hong Kong

Mindy Grossman;When Mindy Grossman became head of the ailing Home Shopping Network, few would have predicted the scale of its transformation;Company: HSNLast year’s position: 43Age: 54Nationality: AmericanSector: General retailingLocation: USWhen Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, tapped Mindy Grossman on the shoulder to head up the media conglomerate’s ailing Home Shopping Network five years ago, few would have predicted the scale of the transformation.HSN was losing market share to its rival QVC and had gone through seven chief executives in 10 years. Grossman said last year that she needed to “put a stake in the ground” and say “we’re going to own lifestyle commerce and we’re going to be the future of transactional innovation”.She came with a wealth of retailing and brand marketing experience, having held senior positions at Tommy Hilfiger, been chief executive of Ralph Lauren’s Chaps brand, and head of Polo Jeans, before she expanded the clothing offering of Nike into a $4bn business powerhouse during a seven-year stint. She understood shopping and women – vital planks to build HSN into a disruptive force.Two years after she took the helm, IAC was able to spin off HSN with a ­Nasdaq listing.Grossman has revolutionised HSN’s brands. She brought in lines from the likes of rapper Sean “P Diddy” Combs and tennis player Serena Williams and launched a companion channel, making the company the only multichannel retailer. Revenues for 2010 were just shy of $3bn, 8.9 per cent up on 2011.
422;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-11-11T19:09:56Z;It pays to advertise . . . in old-fashioned ways;TV adverts and mailshots vie with Google;Andrew Kerry is no Luddite. His Norfolk-based business, Mattressman, generates 60 per cent of its sales online. Recently, it won an award for its innovative use of Ebay and Amazon marketplaces to sell its mattresses, beds and duvets.However, he recently switched a large chunk of the budget that his company spent on Google’s Adwords system to the more traditional medium of television advertising.Mattressman has not stopped using Google, but it now just pays when people search on its brand name rather than more generic words, such as bed or mattress. This is because the price of Adwords is dictated by an auction. Few people bid for the word “Mattressman”, so it costs just a few pence a pop, as opposed to several pounds that have to be paid for generic words.“I would rather pay 10p for someone searching on my brand name than pay a lot more for a term like ‘bed’, when there is no guarantee that they go to my company first,” Kerry says.A television campaign costs a few thousand pounds, but that is money spent on building a brand, according to Kerry. “The trouble with trading purely online is that you struggle to create a brand,” he says. “My biggest competitors are not the mattress brands, like Dreams or Bensons for Beds, but other online traders.”With television nowadays, there are far more opportunities available. Unlike 30 years ago, when there were just three terrestrial channels, only one of which took adverts, there are now dozens on offer, each targeting a viewing niche. This not only makes TV advertising cheaper but allows companies to focus their marketing efforts on particular audiences.Mattressman spent its money sponsoring a Kerry Katona programme on ITV2, which it knew would hit its core audience of shoppers: 35 to 45-year-old women.Mattressman is not alone in seeing the advantages of old-school media. Catherine Becker, chief operating officer at media agency AdConnection, claims that half her clients have switched resources from Google to television in the past few years.This is partly to reduce their reliance on a single digital medium, partly to make better use of limited resources – and partly because people tend to watch television while surfing the web, and are more likely to link a name heard on a TV advert with an internet search, Becker argues.“People are trying a number of techniques away from Google, but TV seems to have the biggest impact,” she says.It’s all about blending different media to get more out of all of them, according to Cameron Hulett, head of global sales and marketing at Acceleration – a digital marketing agency that has advised The Economist, a sister publication of the FT, Nike and Moneysupermarket.He advises companies to use multiple internet search engines. “Seldom should you be using one channel to do your advertising,” he says. “If you are using Google, you should say I will also try Yahoo.”Television is more of a slow-burn marketing approach, compared with the immediacy of internet searches, but its effects can prove longer lasting.Mattressman’s first television appearance was three months ago, but the company is still receiving enquiries linked to the campaign.It is also becoming more cost-effective – not just because the competition for certain Google search terms is driving up online costs, but also because the cost of traditional media advertising are falling.William Davies, managing director of Aspect.co.uk, a residential and commercial property management business, keeps a close eye on what he calls “the cost per call” of his marketing effort – tracking the amount spent per customer call, rather than every click on Google search words.Four years ago, Aspect was paying on average £3 per call using pay-per-click advertising such as Google Adwords, and £18 per call for adverts placed in printed directories, like Yellow Pages and Thomson Local, these prices have now merged. As a result, Aspect will pay £12 whichever way it promotes itself.Another old-fashioned communications medium seeing a limited comeback is the marketing letter.Kashflow, which sells small-business accountancy software supplied over the web, recently switched from marketing via email to sending direct mail posted to a customer’s office.An initial trial, in which half its target audience received emails and half received letters, found that those who got letters were 24.5 per cent more likely to convert into paying customers.Snail mail now has novelty value, according to Duane Jackson, Kashflow’s founder and chief executive.“A few years ago, marketing by direct mail was seen as something not worth doing any more. But things have come full circle and you’re more likely to get someone’s attention by sending them a letter.”Technology still plays a key role in Kashflow’s marketing strategy, though. It sends the letter template in digital format to a third-party direct mail business, Viapost.com, which then takes care of the printing and posting.“We’ve managed to automate it and avoid stuffing hundreds of thousands of envelopes,” Jackson explains.This is not to say that direct mail is the answer for every type of business. Becker agrees that the novelty factor does seem to work for those with corporate clients. However, she claims that it has the opposite effect on residential customers, who still loathe junk mail.But even those who have returned to traditional marketing techniques agree that a single medium is not necessarily the best way to reach an audience.Given that many people now surf the internet while watching television, a marketing strategy that targets both does not seem like such a backward-looking idea.
423;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-11-08T16:39:17Z;Ad spend on China Central TV rises 12.5%;;Chinese and foreign companies have pledged to spend Rmb14.25bn ($2.24bn) on advertising on China Central Television, a rise of 12.5 per cent from last year as domestic groups seek to firmly establish their brands with Chinese consumers.The increase was slower than the rates of between 15 and 18 per cent seen over the past five years but still indicates that China will remain the world’s fastest-growing large advertising market, in a reflection of solid confidence in strong consumer demand.The national broadcaster’s annual auction of advertising slots is seen as a bellwether for the Chinese economy because of its dominant position in the market. CCTV accounted for close to 40 per cent of China’s total advertising spend and more than 50 per cent of the nation’s TV screen time share last year, according to Charm Communications. In past years, Chinese ad spending has been growing at about 150 per cent of the gross domestic product growth rate.In a 12-hour marathon of many rounds of frantic bidding, Chinese companies grabbed the top ranks among the big spenders for next year. As with last year, the alcohol and financial industries were the largest spenders. Moutai, the maker of the fiery liquor, topped the ranking, pledging to spend a total of Rmb498m on CCTV ads next year.“After the 2008 financial crisis many Chinese companies that had been focused on export started to try and use their manufacturing capacity towards the domestic consumer and slapping a brand on their products,” said Zhou Wei, chief financial officer of Charm, the largest agency by successful bids in the CCTV auction. “And many established brands such as the large state banks are becoming more sophisticated in their advertising as they are switching their attention from corporate to individual customers.”Bank of China, for example, grabbed the coveted first 10-second advertising slot after the daily 7pm news broadcast for the first two months of 2012 for Rmb76m.Some of the fastest increases in spending come from internet companies. The IT sector’s share in the total bidding amount jumped from 2.5 per cent last year to 8 per cent. Taobao and Jingdong Mall, China’s two largest online retail companies, which had not even registered in last year’s ranking, account for 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively of the total bidding amount in a reflection of fierce competition in the e-commerce sector.Foreign companies are much less prominent as their ad spending increases have not kept up with those of the budding domestic brands. P&G, which had been the top bidder between 2003 and 2008, is now down to number 43. Other foreign brands among the top 100 spenders on 2012 CCTV advertising are Nike, Toyota, the Taiwanese food brands President and Tingyi, Coca-Cola, Intel and Sony.CCTV’s 15 national channels make the broadcaster a key channel for reaching consumers beyond China’s largest cities, in smaller towns and the countryside. “Many international brands are only present in the largest cities, so this national spread is more important for local brands,” said Mr Zhou.

The Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies is to find ways of applying the kind of entrepreneurial skills made famous at Stanford, situated in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, to spur economic growth.Though one of the largest gifts ever received by Stanford University, it is just half the sum donated to the University of Chicago’s business school in 2008 by David Booth.The Stanford money has been given by Robert and Dorothy King, the former a graduate of the business school (1960) and a venture investor through his firm, Peninsula Capital. The couple say their interest in developing economies was fuelled when some of Stanford’s international students stayed at their home. One was a Chinese student who was instrumental in founding Baidu, a Chinese-language search engine, set up with seed capital from Mr King’s Peninsular Capital. Now an internet giant, Baidu employs more than 10,000 people in China.Providing seed capital or microfinance will not be the primary focus of the new venture, says Mr King, but there will be a focus on growing established businesses. “One of the challenges is to take businesses to scale. It’s the on-the-ground work that really excites me.” The institute will work with not-for-profit organisations, NGOs, and entrepreneurs in developing countries. Students on the Stanford MBA programme will be encouraged to participate in these projects between the first and second year of their two-year degree.The on-the-ground work is just one of three areas of focus. The other two are academic research and teaching, through courses for Stanford students, alumni and entrepreneurs from developing countries, who will be financed to study in California through the institute.For Garth Saloner, the South African dean of Stanford GSB, the institute should bring two benefits. “The end goal here is poverty alleviation and capacity building for Stanford University.”One of the most distinctive elements of the initiative is that although housed at the business school, every department at the university could be involved, including engineering, healthcare, law or public policy. The multidisciplinary approach is what distinguishes the centre from others in the US, says the dean. “I do think directionally that this (alleviating poverty in developing economies) is the sort of activity that people do not usually associate with a business school. “But issues such as sustainability, governance and water policy are areas where leadership and entrepreneurship can play a critical role, he argues.Of all top business schools it is Stanford that has been leading the way in developing interdisciplinary teaching, seen as critical as the world of public policy, law and regulation increasingly informs business decisions. At Stanford one in six MBA students study on a double degree programme – getting a degree in engineering as well as business, for example. Prof Saloner says he hopes to increase the number to one in every four MBAs.When the Kings approached the business school with their plan, Prof Saloner said that the school had already developed a group of faculty that taught regularly on issues relating to development and entrepreneurship. A proportion of MBA students had also worked on the ground in developing economies as part of a course called Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability.The Kings are no novices either. In 1995 they set up a venture philanthropy foundation, Thrive, to fund social ventures for young people in the US. “The experience we have had with Thrive has been the model for the institute.”The agreement between the business school and the Kings took 18 months to negotiate. The Kings have made a $100m gift to fund the institute and committed a further $50m in matched funding, to involve other donors in the project.Located in Palo Alto, Stanford University lays claim to having educated the creators of some of the world’s top entrepreneurial companies, including Google, Yahoo and Nike.Nike founder and chairman Phil Knight, a 1962 graduate, gave $105m to the business school in 2006, to support the building of a new campus for the school. At the time, the Knight gift was the largest ever donation to a business school, but in 2008 investment specialist David Booth pledged $300m to the University of Chicago’s business school, subsequently renamed Chicago Booth. Mr Booth asserted that he built his fortune by applying the efficient market theories he learnt while a student at Chicago.

It is believed that they have been frustrated by the lack of communication from Twickenham about the management crisis.The RFU’s problems worsened when England returned home from the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand under a storm of criticism for their performance on the pitch and their indiscipline off it. A review into the debacle is under way but a separate inquiry set up by Mr Thomas has now been dropped.Some of the FRU’s sponsorships expire at the end of this season, and talks are under way over their renewal. Although the staging of the 2015 World Cup in England offers the RFU a strong reason to seek better terms from sponsors, the Twickenham crisis and the team’s abject showing in New Zealand was threatening to weaken its negotiating position.Ahead of the board meeting, Mr Thomas was already the subject of a disciplinary investigation into the board’s handling of the sacking in June of former chief executive John Steele.Mr Thomas quit as chairman as a result of his role in Mr Steele’s departure, but maintained his influence in Twickenham by taking on the chief executive role. He was also an RFU representative on the International Rugby Board and the Six Nations Committee, and chairman of RWC 2015, the tournament organising body.That sacking was investigated by Judge Jeff Blackett, the RFU’s chief disciplinary officer, who concluded that the governance at the top of the RFU was “broken” and that most of the board should quit.The RFU was also coming under scrutiny from sports minister Hugh Robertson. The RFU on Wednesday confirmed that Andrew Higginson, a former Tesco director, and Miles Templeman, former director-general of the Institute of Directors, would be joining the board as independent non-executive directors.
426;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-10-19T17:16:24Z;Going into battle for design;;"With fashion designers becoming ever more concerned about counterfeits (Those bags on the street corner! Those high street dresses! Those undies on eBay!) and the need to protect their work, lawmakers around the world are becoming likewise engaged in helping them to protect their intellectual property.At issue is the threat to high-end brand equity that occurs when a “copy” – be it obvious rip-off, slightly skewed logo (Niki instead of Nike), or less expensive “homage” – appears, possibly diluting not just the image of the product itself, but the values attached to its maker’s name. Though brands have been fighting this for years, governments are increasingly joining the battle.Just last week, for example, I received a notice from the United States Chamber of Commerce about a letter it had written to the chairman of the House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet (golly, that’s a long name) in support of the “Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act” currently before Congress.And then, today I discovered, via Harbottle & Lewis, the lawyers, that the UK patent office had created a “once in a generation opportunity to reform UK design laws and make them more suitable to protect Britain’s design community.”Onward, oh fashion soldiers!Specifically, the UK patent office has issued a “call for evidence:” a document that asks designers, both clothing and industrial, about their patent practices thus far, whether they feel protected, whether they have a fatalistic attitude to it all (“Oh, there’s nothing you can do to copyright a dress”), and so on. The results aim to help to form proposals “to improve the UK design system” which will be set out in a formal consultation on the UK design system next year.This was all initiated by a study written by Prof Ian Hargreaves (generally known as “the Hargreaves review of intellectual property”), which found that “design has an important contribution to make to growth, and it is unsatisfactory that we start from such a low base of understanding in considering how best to optimise the IP framework to support this growth”. Specifically, the Hargreaves review noted that “design contributes in many important ways to the UK economy; in fact £33.5bn was invested in design in 2008, which is 2.4 per cent of GDP.”And when design is ripped off by others, it results in erosion of brand equity, as consumers become confused about value and whether a design is good or shoddy, which leads to erosion of profits, which leads to less investment – which is bad for everyone.So why the interest? In the immortal words of Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign strategist James Carville: “It’s the economy, stupid.”"
427;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-10-10T15:17:10Z;Li Ning raises concerns for Chinese brands;;In the latest rankings of the richest people in China, Li Ning– founder of one of the country’s most famous retail brands – has tumbled from 64 last year to 291.The decline in fortune mirrors that of the Olympic gymnast’s self-named brand, which last year had overtaken Adidas for second place in the Chinese sportswear market. At that time, the chief executive was predicting it would be a top-five global sportswear brand by the end of the decade.But Li Ning has since seen its profits and share price plunge and is rethinking its ambitious branding strategy.Is this a temporary setback, or is there a bamboo ceiling that stops Chinese brands from becoming truly competitive even in their own market? The question is whether Chinese companies are strong enough in branding, marketing, innovation, design and quality to become something more than just copycats.With so few successful Chinese brands in the global marketplace, the trials and tribulations of Li Ning can be seen as a proxy for the fortunes of brand China.The founder, who lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is not only one of China’s top athletes but also among its most renowned entrepreneurs. His appearance at the Bird’s Nest stadium – which instantly linked the powerful nationalism of the event with his brand – must rank as one of the marketing coups of the decade.But those days seem long gone: Li Ning’s net profits fell 50 per cent in the first half year on year, and its share price has fallen 57 per cent since the beginning of the year.Last year Li Ning unveiled a new logo (which, like its original one, bears a resemblance to the Nike swoosh), and a plan to reposition the brand as a near-direct competitor with global brands such as Nike and Adidas.But with many consumers unwilling to follow a local brand upmarket, Li Ning appears to be returning to its cheap-and-cheerful roots. It still holds a slight advantage over Adidas in the China market led by Nike, but market analysts expect it to slip back to third place soon. Chinese customers in general do not want to spend extra for a domestic brand if they can afford a foreign one.“Li Ning has done really well to challenge Adidas, but it has done it by copying the model,” says Andy Edwards, head of planning at BBH, the advertising agency, in Shanghai. “Now Li Ning needs to build greater value, stop copying and find its own unique voice … and drive this through everything the brand does, especially the product.”Shaun Rein, author of a forthcoming book, The End of Cheap China, says Chinese companies are trying to build brands “but for every two steps forward there is one step back”.Three years ago, when Li Ning was a rapidly growing force, its “brand positioning wasn’t strategic enough”, he says. “They went from saying we are the best Chinese brand, to saying we are going to take on Nike globally, to going back to cheap again, over a three-year period. They didn’t keep consistency in their image.”Zhang Zhiyong, chief executive, admitted in a recent interview with the Beijing News that Li Ning had lost loyal customers when it raised prices. “I think we have to learn how to balance the price-driven and the quality-driven,” he said.At a Li Ning outlet in the Shanghai suburb of Hongkou, salesman Dai Quangang says his store no longer carries the high-end products. “This is a residential area and laobaixing [ordinary folks] prefer lower-priced products,” he says. The shop now stocks athletic shoes priced from Rmb339 to Rmb569 ($53-$90), compared with the Rmb580-Rmb1,180 shoes at the Adidas shop across the street.Meanwhile, Adidas is expanding aggressively into Li Ning territory in smaller Chinese cities, and aims to boost its presence from 550 to 1,000 cities by 2015. Colin Currie, Adidas head for greater China, says that, even in poorer cities, consumers are eager to trade up to foreign brands as their income rises.HSBC forecasts that local brands will lose market share in the coming year as wage rises pick up pace.“Chinese consumers tend to have low brand loyalty, especially in the lower-tier cities,” HSBC said in a recent report. “As Nike and Adidas are introducing lower-priced products, it comes into question whether the fans of domestic brands will continue to maintain their loyalty.”For its part, Li Ning is predicting two or three years of “short-term pain” as it moves to “better adapt to, and even lead, the long-term development of the sporting goods industry in China”.Those who track the progress of brand China will be watching to see if the company can break the bamboo ceiling once and for all.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
428;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Reebok settles exaggerated claims case;;"Reebok International, the US sportswear company owned by Adidas, agreed on Wednesday to pay $25m to settle charges and offer refunds for shoes that it claimed strengthened leg and buttock muscles.The US Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against the company, alleging that claims its EasyTone and RunTone shoes had a strengthening effect were deceptive and that they did not provide health benefits beyond those of traditional trainers.“The FTC wants national advertisers to understand that they must exercise some responsibility and ensure that their claims for fitness gear are supported by sound science,” said David Vladeck, director of the FTC’s bureau of consumer protection.The shoes sell for up to $100 a pair and Reebok claimed they provided 28 per cent more strength and tone in the buttock muscles, 11 per cent more strength and tone in the hamstring muscles, and 11 per cent more strength and tone in the calf muscles than regular walking shoes. By providing less stability than normal shoes, “toning” shoes are intended to make certain muscles work harder.Reebok advertisements for the shoes claimed that they had pockets of moving air in the soles that created “micro-instability”. The advertisements promised that the firming effect of the shoes would make men speechless and women jealous.The settlement comes as the FTC has been pursuing deceptive advertising more aggressively as part of its efforts to protect consumers.Sales of toning shoes peaked at $1bn in the US last year, according to the FTC, and the settlement could deal a blow to other shoe companies that have benefited from the fad. Skechers, a rival footwear company, helped popularise toning shoes with its Shape-ups, and New Balance sells Rock & Tone shoes.Nike resisted entering the market for toning shoes and mocked the trend last year with ads proclaiming: “This shoe works if you do.”Under the terms of the settlement, Reebok is barred from making claims that toning products strengthen muscles without scientific evidence and is not allowed to misrepresent such studies, the FTC said.Reebok pulled the ads during the FTC investigation but said on Wednesday it stands by the technology behind its toning shoes, which were inspired by balance ball training.“Settling does not mean we agree with the allegations; we do not,” the company said. “We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from thousands of EasyTone customers.”Reebok now claims on its website that EasyTone sneakers are “perfect for walking and everyday activities”."

Dayron Robles v Liu Xiang. Sebastian Coe v Steve Ovett. Like many of the great sporting rivals who endorse their products, Nike and Adidas tend to snap at each other’s heels. Over a decade, it is almost a photo-finish: Nike shares up by 290 per cent, Adidas by 270 per cent.Not surprisingly, robust first-quarter earnings from Nike last week prompted an almost synchronised uptick in Adidas stock. What impressed investors was the strength of Nike’s sales growth. Nike brand revenues were up 12 per cent year-on-year once currency fluctuations were eliminated, and its future orders stand 13 per cent higher (for the September-January period on a similar currency-neutral basis). Almost all regions kicked in, with emerging markets leading the way. But North America also posted a surprisingly strong 15 per cent revenue increase. Pressure on margins appears to be easing off, too. The one dull spot was western Europe, where sales were flat, although that was partly due to comparisons with World Cup-inflated revenues of a year ago. Future orders are slightly ahead.Many of these positive trends should benefit Adidas, too. It has already raised its 2011 sales forecast twice this year – most recently in August, when it predicted a 10 per cent currency-adjusted rise together with stable gross margins. Investors may worry, however, that in the long term, the German company is more exposed to trends in western Europe, which accounts for 30 per cent of revenues compared with
23 per cent of Nike’s. Moreover, like their running shoes, shares in both companies already come with a stiff price tag. Nike trades at 19 times prospective earnings, Adidas at 16 times. Given the global economic headwinds, investors should expect more of a marathon than a sprint, at least until after the next bend.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

It was down 6 per cent over the week to 882.18.Fears about Italy’s credit risk intensified after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the country’s sovereign debt rating on Tuesday. S&P subsequently cut the long-term credit ratings of seven Italian lenders and lowered its outlook to “negative” on eight more, including UniCredit, which lost 5.6 per cent this week to €0.68. Analysts fear that Italy’s largest bank may need as much as an €8bn funding boost to conform with Basel III requirements.French banks endured a torrid few days, amid investor nervousness about their exposure to Greece and Italy, and lingering liquidity concerns. The Financial Times revealed on Tuesday that Siemens, the German industrial group, recently withdrew more than €500m in cash deposits from Société Générale, which tumbled 12.2 per cent to €16.65 over the week.BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole were also down heavily, by 10.2 per cent to €25.32 and 10.1 per cent to €4.43 respectively over the week, in spite of an impressive rally on Friday afternoon in which BNP Paribas jumped 9.8 per cent and SocGen climbed 8.8 per cent.Worse hit still was Austrian lender Raiffeisen International, which lost 5.3 per cent on Friday and 20.4 per cent over the week to €19.19, its lowest level since March 2009. Erste Group Bank was also weaker after concerns about growth in eastern Europe and rumours of an imminent downgrade of Austrian sovereign debt.European carmakers were hit over fears that a global economic slowdown would diminish demand in the sector. France’s Peugeot lost 12.7 per cent to €16.11 over the week, while Germany’s Volkswagen fell 10.9 per cent to €92.97.Concerns about global economic conditions affecting demand for infrastructure also depressed Europe’s metal manufacturers. Paris-listed ArcelorMittal and Austria’s Voestalpine were among the heaviest losers, down this week by 14.1 per cent to €11.47 and 14.8 per cent to €21.04 respectively.Meanwhile, large losses by London-listed miners hit Europe’s mining and oilfield support services groups. Technip, the French oilfield services group, lost 3.9 per cent to €57.99 on Friday after incurring heavy losses on Thursday, resulting in a 15.06 per cent fall over the week.After issuing a profit warning on Tuesday, airline Deutsche Lufthansa lost 15.7 per cent to €9.36 this week. German utility company Eon shed 6.8 per cent to €14.56, in spite of an upgrade by S&P.There was good news on Friday for Bayer, the German pharmaceuticals company, which climbed 7.1 per cent to €39.42 on Friday, after European regulators recommended approval of its biggest pipeline drug, Xarelto, for use in the mass market of stroke prevention.
431;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Nike bucks trend with jump in US sales;;Nike, the US sporting goods group, underscored its position as a retailer that has been immune to the effects of the US economic slump as it reported quarterly sales up 16 per cent and profits up 21 per cent in its North American business.In an unusual reversal of recent corporate trends, Nike’s performance in its home region and Japan surpassed its growth in greater China and central and eastern Europe, two crucial emerging market regions, in the three months to August 31.Overall, the company – which owns Converse and Cole Haan as well as its eponymous brand – reported earnings before interest and taxes that were up 13 per cent to $852m, while sales climbed 18 per cent to $6.1bn.In North America, its biggest market, revenues hit $2.2bn and earnings rose to $534m.Its international results were boosted by currency effects but marred by weakness in western Europe, where profits fell from a year ago.Mark Parker, Nike’s chief executive, said its North American results partly reflected the initial benefits of the company’s five-year plan, announced early last year, to invest $500m-$600m in its own-branded stores and ecommerce businesses.Faye Landes, managing director of Consumer Edge Research, said: “This is yet another example, along with the success of Apple’s devices and of Amazon’s Kindle [ereader], of people reaching into their pockets and buying items that they want, which often feature ‘cool’ design, even in a challenging economic environment.”She said Nike’s best-selling items included $150 basketball shoes that were bought by young men, a group that in many developed countries is suffering from a high rate of unemployment.Nike’s gross profit margin, however, dropped 2.7 percentage points to 44.3 per cent due to the impact of higher commodity and freight costs. Nike said it expected margins to begin recovering toward the end of its current financial year, which began in June.The company’s Japan revenues rose 17 per cent to $191m, while earnings before interest and tax in that country increased 26 per cent to $34m.In greater China, sales improved 15 per cent to $528m and earnings rose 4 per cent to $171m. In central and eastern Europe, revenues rose 24 per cent to $334m but earnings were unchanged from a year ago at $70m.In western Europe, Nike’s second-biggest market after North America, revenues rose 14 per cent but were flat at $1.2bn excluding currency changes. Earnings fell 21 per cent to $223m, partly due to the difficulty of matching strong sales last year inspired by the World Cup.

The answer is no,” he said, adding that JD would continue to look for “appropriate acquisition opportunities” with the £19.2m cash on its balance sheet.However, the company has successfully poached JJB’s retail director Ron Rome, who will join as international retail director before the end of this year. He will be responsible for JD’s continued push into France and Spain, where it has acquired stakes in the Chausport and Sprinter chains. Analysts welcomed news that the company is to open JD Sports-branded stores in Europe next year, as half-year results showed that the UK market remains challenging.Underlying profits before tax and exceptional items fell 17.3 per cent to £16m in the six months to July 30, against the same period a year previously, on revenues up 14.6 per cent to £440m.The chain lost £700,000 worth of stock in the August riots, but is pursuing a multi-million pound insurance claim which includes repair costs for the 16 affected stores and compensation for business interruption. “Because we’re negotiating with the insurers at the moment it’s a sensitive figure,” said Mr Cowgill, who expects the claim to be resolved by the company’s year end and said it would not have an “adverse impact”.Having risen consistently for seven years, like-for-like sales across the group fell by 0.9 per cent in the period, excluding VAT. However, in the last seven weeks, like-for-like sales have risen 1.6 per cent against the same period a year ago.Reporting margin slippage of 20 basis points in the period, Mr Cowgill considered this an “excellent performance” considering input cost rises, guiding that he expected the full-year outlook to be broadly similar.Like the department store group Debenhams, JD’s 503 sports fashion stores have been helped by its higher-margin own brands, including McKenzie and Duffer of St George, which account for around 15 per cent of revenues. Some analysts think the margin outturn means that figure is getting higher.“It would appear that JD is pushing its own brands at the expense of key third-party brands such as Adidas and Nike who have been passing on price increases of around 5-10 per cent due to the high price of cotton, rubber and polyester,” said Peter Smedley, retail analyst at Charles Stanley Securities.JD’s 124 fashion stores, which trade under the Bank Fashion and Scotts names, reported stronger like-for-like sales but continued expansion caused operating losses of £3.4m in the period.On Wednesday, shares added 1.5p to 842p, a rise of less than 1 per cent.

434;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Revolt over risks of elite class of bankers;A mismatch of assets and liabilities lies at the heart of global finance;We don’t know what exactly was done by Kweku Adoboli, the man accused of being a “rogue trader” at UBS, but the bare facts of his life are significant in themselves. A 31-year-old Ghanaian, who went to school and university in the UK, worked in the City of London on an international equity derivatives trading desk for a Swiss bank.That career would have been highly improbable three decades ago but Mr Adoboli was born shortly after the 1979 election of Margaret Thatcher, who first abolished exchange controls and then deregulated the City, allowing it fully to regain its role as a global financial centre. His life and career are products of the three-decade-long rise of cross-border finance in London and New York.Mr Adoboli’s arrest may signal the high-water mark of that era. It came as Europe struggled to prevent the Greek crisis from bringing down French banks and forcing a break-up of the euro. Germans are unhappy at the idea that their country should further support Mediterranean countries with far higher debt burdens by backing the issue of eurozone sovereign bonds.In the UK, a commission headed by Sir John Vickers recommended that the UK “ringfence” the retail operations of high street banks such as Barclays to protect domestic deposits from being put at risk by an international crisis similar to that of 2007 and 2008. It wants UK savers to be shielded from the banking “casino” in the City.Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, told the Financial Times that the committee of international banking regulators that meets in Basel (one of UBS’s home cities) was being “ anti-American” by imposing higher capital standards for banks such as his that are “too big to fail”. The US should, he insisted, be prepared to withdraw from Basel to protect its sovereign interests. The common thread of this week’s events is that national depositors and taxpayers are revolting against the idea that they should bear the risks of international finance and permit an elite class of global bankers such as Mr Adoboli – or the feckless citizens of other countries – to take the rewards. As they draw back, global financial regulation is creaking at the seams.In some ways, this is a shame. It is the financial equivalent of the trade protectionism that erupted after the 1929 crash, when the US and other countries raised tariffs. But it is not surprising. Investment bankers in the City and on Wall Street have done little to earn back favour after the recent bail-outs.Banks traditionally do their best to match their assets and their liabilities – to ensure the money they borrow from depositors and markets matches the loans it used to fund. When there is a mismatch – the two are in different currencies or at another interest rate, for example – trouble often follows.An enormous mismatch of assets and liabilities has lain at the heart of international finance for the past several decades. Retail and private bank deposits in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland and France have been used to support the expansion by banks such as UBS, Barclays, Société Générale, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan into global markets.This had benefits for global trade and commerce, which have grown hugely in that period. It has made it easier for US and European companies to attract investors from other countries. Companies such as Apple and Nike have been able to finance and assemble global supply chains, creating jobs in Asia and lowering their prices.But the useful functions of global markets have been accompanied by a vast increase in risk-taking and a bonus culture that most outsiders find abhorrent. For every hedge fund manager who has made billions in this era, there are millions of depositors for whom the benefits are far smaller and less tangible. They regard all traders as rogues.The euro was emblematic – a cross-border project supported by the political elite and by businesses about which many ordinary Europeans had doubts because they could not see what use it was to them. But they tolerated it as long as it appeared to work, just as the growth of global investment banking was regarded as irrelevant to most people’s day-to-day lives.This period of recent history is ending with a bang. The fact that the $2bn hole attributed to Mr Adoboli has opened up in the balance sheet of UBS – an institution that has repeatedly suffered massive losses in its international banking operations – is a sign of how little has changed there.Oswald Grübel, the respected former head of Credit Suisse brought in to clean up UBS after it lost billions in the 2008 crisis, imposed new risk controls and told his traders not to lose money. Yet despite all the safeguards, the Delta One trading desk where Mr Adoboli worked, it seems did precisely that.UBS will withstand the loss by itself but Swiss taxpayers are sick of being lenders of last resort to their international banks, and German taxpayers are tired of being asked to finance Greek debts. They do not see why they should assume the liability for someone else’s lossmaking assets and outsized rewards.The Vickers report on UK banking is, I believe, not only sensible but also the only politically viable option in a world where international finance has exhausted most people’s patience. If taxpayers are going to be forced to support their banks in future financial crises, it will need to be only the ones from which they gain tangible benefits.Mr Dimon believes it is unfair that his capital burden is rising sharply as global regulators try to ensure that such institutions do not need to be bailed-out again. He may have a point on details but, on the bigger principle, his time is up.
435;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
436;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-09-12T02:25:52Z;Ethical labour standards are good for business;;From Mr Brendan Barber.Sir, Michael Skapinker (“Time for Apple to open up its factories”, September 8) is right. Openness about where the goods that multinational companies and their customers buy are made is vital to ensuring that ethical standards are upheld, workers are not exploited and the environment is protected.What Nike has found to work, and what Mr Skapinker urges for Apple, is also true for Locog, the body which is running the London Olympics. Following discussions with the Trades Union Congress-backed Playfair 2012 campaign, Locog has taken positive steps to ensure mascots, T-shirts and other branded goods are made by workers who enjoy decent wages, good health and safety, and can join unions. It has written the base code of the Ethical Trading Initiative – principally adherence to the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation – into its contracts.But so far Locog has been wary of revealing where the goods are made. Between now and the start of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, I hope it will have the courage Nike and others have shown – and that your columnist urges on Apple – to open up. Transparency is good for workers, good for customers, and part of the Olympic ideal.Brendan Barber, TUC General Secretary, London WC1, UK
437;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-09-09T18:55:12Z;Man City chief resigns over leaked e-mail;;Garry Cook, chief executive of Manchester City, has resigned over a leaked e-mail that appeared to make light of the cancer suffered by a player’s mother.The football club boss had been under pressure since the publication of the message intended for a colleague but sent to Anthonia Onuoha, mother and agent of Nedum Onuoha, who was negotiating a new contract while ill with cancer.Mr Cook had claimed the email was sent by someone who hacked into his computer but on Friday admitted to “an error of judgment”.The club said there was “foundation to Dr Onuoha’s allegations” and has apologised for any distress caused.Khaldoon Al Mubarak, chairman, said the resignation was accepted with regret. “Garry has made a remarkable contribution to Manchester City Football Club over the past three years,” he said, and would “always be welcome” at the club.Mr Cook arrived when Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled former Thai premier, owned the club. The former Nike executive stayed on when Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family bought it in 2008.Last season the club qualified for the Champions League for the first time and won the FA Cup, their first major trophy in 42 years.Mr Cook was credited with improving and professionalising the operation of the club, leading to a big rise in commercial revenues. It still makes huge losses, underwritten by Shiekh Mansour, because of its large wage bill and transfer fees to assemble a squad capable of winning the Premier League.He improved the experience for fans and had concluded a sponsorship deal with Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based airline, worth almost £400m over 10 years that renamed City’s stadium.He has kept a low media profile since describing Mr Shinawatra as a “good guy” to play golf with.
438;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Time for Apple to open its factories;It is hard for companies to keep track of the kinds of damage their sub-contactors might do;"The head of a leading sportswear company once told me a contractor had introduced pregnancy testing at its factories.That sounded good, I said – manufacturers taking care of their female employees. He gave me a pitying look. The factory had introduced the tests so it could fire pregnant workers before they could claim maternity leave. He had asked them to stop.It is hard for companies to keep track of the kinds of damage their sub-contractors might do to their reputations. Most big brands use hundreds of manufacturers, which could be anywhere from Egypt to El Salvador, Chile to China.The contractors often operate in countries where inspection is lax or non-existent. They may pay less than the local minimum wage or force long-standing employees to sign short-term contracts in violation of national laws.In one case, mentioned in a recent report by the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation, a factory in Indonesia allegedly locked workers who had not reached their production targets in an unventilated room without toilets, food or water for more than three hours.So Apple was in familiar straits when it faced accusations that some of its Chinese contractors were causing widespread pollution. The allegations were particularly damaging. The campaigners accusing Apple were Chinese, not westerners who could be depicted as outside busybodies.Defenders of international manufacturers sometimes say it is wrong to apply developed country labour standards to emerging markets. When western trade unions complain about the treatment of workers in far-flung factories, critics allege they are simply trying to protect their own jobs. But no one can defend environmental degradation, which is attracting growing local opposition in China. (No one should defend violation of local labour laws either.)Apple takes contractors’ behaviour seriously. Its most recent supplier responsibility report says it has audited 288 contractors’ facilities since 2007. It pays particular attention to employees who work outside their home countries. Many pay large fees to labour agencies, which mean they have to work for months to pay off their debts. Apple says it has limited recruitment fees to one month’s net wages and has forced suppliers to reimburse $3.4m to workers who had paid more.Apple says it monitors supplier factories for their environmental performance too. But it could do much more. A few of Apple’s suppliers are known, sometimes for the wrong reasons. An explosion in May at a Foxconn factory in Chengdu, China which was producing the iPad 2, killed three workers. Apple has admitted that 137 workers were poisoned by a cleaning chemical at a factory in Suzhou run by Wintek, like Foxconn, a Taiwanese-owned manufacturer.But Apple does not generally say who its contractors are. The Chinese campaigners said they used public information and court documents to come up with a list of 20 suppliers.The clothing and sportswear industry has done it differently. In 2005, Nike posted the names and addresses of its suppliers on its website. Levi Strauss and Adidas have done the same.It wasn’t an easy decision. David Doorey of York University in Toronto says Nike spent some years resisting student protesters who demanded to know where their campus clothing was made. Nike was worried that campaigners would uncover even more abuses at its factories and that competitors would steal its intellectual property.In fact, Prof Doorey says, once the information became public and rivals realised they were using the same factories, they found that they could co-operate to enforce common standards. Suppliers whose locations were published had an interest in abiding by those standards too.Nike still gets targeted; it was one of the companies named in the textile union report, although no specific allegations were made against it. But Hannah Jones, its head of sustainable business, says these criticisms have become the basis for useful conversations.Apple might argue that an iPad is more complicated than a running shoe, but competitors can take either apart once they have them. Opening your factories to the world is a statement that you would prefer to know the truth and that those who uncover dark secrets will be thanked for their trouble rather than vilified.michael.skapinker@ft.com"
439;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-08-10T12:15:55Z;Hollywood: more is less for Chinese consumers;;"When Transformers: Dark of the Moon entered production in late 2009, marketing executives saw opening before them a new frontier for product placement. Why not cram a truly American plot with Chinese products? OK, so the film has nothing to do with China. But surely Chinese consumers were ready to see their favourite brands on the big screen? And wasn’t Hollywood ready for the likes of Meters/bonwe, a Chinese clothing brand which Shia LaBeouf’s character sports at the start of the film?Well, that was the thinking. But some vocal Chinese film-goers aren’t buying it.There’s little doubt the film’s opening in China was a success. In its first four days in July, Paramount and IMAX took in $3.7m – or $120,000 per screen, the most ever for a US film in China.But it seems at least some viewers were less than receptive to the branding deluge awaiting them. Among more than 60 brands on view in the film, a least four are Chinese and their placement is, for some viewers, heavy handed – particularly one scene in which LaBeouf’s character is told to finish his Shuhua Low Lactose Milk, made by Yili, one of China’s biggest dairy companies.On one Chinese chat forum, Douban (H/T ChinaHush), user JiShan1000 sums up the film:In the beginning: Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, Hermès, Nike, Lenovo, YiLi, Apple, Double A, Ferrari, DODGE, Hummer, Maybach, Bingley. (long lasting rumble of fighting scene), conspiracy, knife, sword, axe, shit. shit shit, humans win. OVER.Another forum member, icebloom, complains: “the countless produce placement advertisements are outrageous.”And another, Haitao, writes: “This is totally the evidence of Chinese enterprises’ power.”Not perhaps the impression that Paramount and IMAX were hoping to leave. Didi Zhang from the advertising firm Ogilvy & Mather, which helped to place Lenovo in the film, told the FT’s Kathrin Hille: “The main motivation is to expand their brand recognition in foreign markets, but for others the focus is on the domestic market because the effect with foreign movies is better.”Not so, according to another Douban member named Fio大虾na: “May I finish my Shuhua milk first!!!??” This is so stupid!!!!!! +_+”For some increasingly discerning Chinese consumers, it seems, less is more.Related reading:

440;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-08-09T18:33:30Z;Football media dispute deepens;;A deepening dispute between the press and football’s governing bodies in the UK is threatening to disrupt media coverage of the Premier League, which kicks off this weekend.Talks between the Football League, the Premier League and News Media Coalition, a trade body that represents newspapers and large news agencies, collapsed last week over a failure to agree on what rights reporters and photographers covering Premiership and Football League matches should have.The licensing agreement that maps out which journalists can attend these matches and how and when they can report has expired. The football leagues have offered a temporary extension, but NMC has rejected the offer, claiming the agreement is too restrictive.“The media landscape has moved on in terms of the speed of delivery to the consumer. Currently, for newspapers, there are only eight precise publishing windows that restrict when and how much is published on websites,” said one person familiar with the negotiations.The existing deal dates back to 2004, two years before Twitter was launched.However, another person familiar with the negotiations said newspapers were not being given the full facts by the coalition. “The position over Twitter and social media has been totally misrepresented by NMC. Journalists will have greater freedom to tweet et cetera under the proposed new agreement.”Newspaper coverage of the start of the football season last weekend was disrupted as journalists were shut out of football grounds. A number of national newspapers scrapped their match reports or left out mentions of sponsors’ names. Some football clubs have since broken ranks and plan to give reporters access this weekend.“We see this as a dispute between the Premier League, the Football League and the sports media in the UK. Therefore, we are not taking sides,” said a spokesman for Barclays, the official sponsor of the Premier League.Lucozade, the official drinks partner of the Premier League, declined to comment, as did Nike, the official ball sponsor. Npower, the energy company and title sponsor of the Football League, said it hoped negotiations would be concluded swiftly.The Newspaper Publishers’ Association, which counts the Financial Times, Trinity Mirror, News International and Guardian News & Media as members, falls under the NMC umbrella.The Times newspaper referred to the dispute in a Monday leader column where it called the opening weekend a “farce” and said football administrators “could not be more inept”.“Instead of encouraging maximum coverage of matches on a marquee weekend, football’s ruling bodies have minimised the projection of their product, to the detriment of fans and sponsors alike,” the paper said.While some smaller news agencies are thought to have accreditation for this weekend, larger agencies including Reuters and the Press Association hope to secure a last-minute deal but have already warned publishers that their coverage is likely to be disrupted.Titles owned by Richard Desmond, including the Daily Star, Daily Express and Sunday Express, are expected to cover matches as normal as they are not NPA members.
441;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-08-04T16:20:49Z;Adidas raises 2011 forecasts for second time;;Adidas has raised its sales and profit forecasts for 2011 after shrugging off rising raw materials costs and hailing Japan’s recovery from its severe earthquake.Europe’s largest sporting goods company by sales said business was better than expected in the first half of the year, with sales up 14 per cent adjusted for currency fluctuations.Sales in China and in European emerging markets such as Russia led the growth, rising 38 per cent and 23 per cent respectively during the first half of the year.Adidas also benefited from shifting a greater share of sales into its own stores where it can expect higher profit margins. The company’s gross margin increased year-on-year in the second quarter, helping to offset rising production costs that are hitting many consumer goods companies.Annual sales this year were now expected to rise by 10 per cent when adjusted for currency fluctuations, Adidas said, compared with the high single-digit range previously outlined. It is the second time this year that the company has raised its sales forecast.The performance from Adidas follows profit growth and bullish estimates from rivals Puma and Nike in recent weeks.Sales in Japan – one of Adidas’s top five markets – had been expected to fall between 15 per cent and 25 per cent for the rest of 2011 after the disruption caused by the tsunami. Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said Japan, whose Adidas-sponsored women’s football team won the World Cup last month, had shown “considerable resilience”, with half of the most affected stores operating again and second-quarter sales down only 1 per cent, meaning Adidas had won market share.While some currency movements against the euro were affecting results in the short term, Adidas was still on the way to “record sales and earnings” in 2011, Mr Hainer said.Revenues in the second quarter rose 5 per cent to €3.1bn while net income rose 10.7 per cent to €140m. Adidas said annual earnings per share of at least €3.10 were now expected compared with a previous estimate of between €2.98 and €3.12.Christoph Dolleschal, an analyst at Commerzbank, said there were doubts over whether Adidas could maintain strong growth in 2012. “We believe that the trend seen this quarter will be the development going forward: US and eurozone with little or no growth and China having to compensate. That could prove to be a risky bet,” he said in a note.Adidas shares rose early but ended 0.6 per cent lower in Frankfurt at €48.54.

Mr Zeitz, who led Puma for 18 years, will remain Puma’s chairman while also heading a “sport and lifestyle” division at PPR, Puma’s French majority owner.Rising commodity prices and higher wages in Asia – a main production centre – are set to continue to affect gross margins, which dipped quarter-on-quarter in the company’s main footwear and apparel segments. But Puma will maintain its marketing and product development spending and said it had “thus far shown an ability to keep its gross profit margins at the highest level within the industry”.Sales rose 9.4 per cent in euro terms in the quarter to €673.5m, and more than 11 per cent to €1.4bn during the first half of the year, with growth strongest in Asia and the Americas. Sales in Japan had rebounded more quickly than expected after the disruption caused by the country’s earthquake and tsunami, Puma said.Quarterly net earnings rose 10.6 per cent to €37.6m while diluted earnings per share rose from €2.25 to €2.51. Operating expenses rose 10.3 per cent to €279.9m during the quarter and Puma said higher operating costs were “in line with overall strategy”.Earnings should increase this year in the mid-single digit range.Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear group by sales, also last month reported strong sales and earnings growth. Adidas, Puma’s local rival and Europe’s biggest sportswear company, reports quarterly earnings next week. Herbert Hainer, Adidas chief executive, said this month he was “confident we will deliver another year of strong financial performance in line with the guidance we have provided”.Puma shares were unchanged at €218.90 in Frankfurt.

444;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-07-21T15:25:25Z;Venezuela’s vinotinto – out, but not down;;"For Venezuelan football fans, the dream of finally winning the Copa America, the regional football competition for national teams, faded away on Wednesday night when their team was knocked out by Paraguay – which will meet Uruguay in Sunday’s final without having won a single game (it got through the knock-out rounds entirely on penalty shoot-outs).But the team’s sponsors will still have been delighted at seeing Venezuela reach the semi-finals for the first time.Companies like Banco Mercantil, Empresas Polar, and Movilnet cannot have imagined South America’s former whipping boys would get that far.After all, even though they have improved hugely over the last decade, Venezuela is still the only South America side never to qualify for the World Cup finals and until this week it had never got past the Copa America’s quarter finals.Now, despite Wednesday’s defeat, those companies look set to be joined by others who want to be associated with the vinotinto, as the Venezuelan side is known.“I can’t say names but I had been after this big company and just this week they came here to negotiate,” said Elvia Mijares, the head of marketing at the Venezuelan football association. “I think more will come. The vinotinto is like a big cake and everybody wants a piece of it. Venezuela was always a baseball country but we’ve worked very hard for more than a decade to promote football and are very much heading in the right direction.”Venezuela gets a flat sum from sponsors plus bonuses depending on how far it advances in international tournaments like the Copa America. Although it won’t reveal exact sums, Mijares said Adidas pays it less than a quarter of the reported $40 million Brazil gets from shirt sponsor Nike.Venezuela’s sponsors are certainly getting more bang for their buck than the continent’s footballing powers. Hosts Argentina and current holders Brazil were dumped out the tournament on penalties at the quarter final stage, by Paraguay and Uruguay, respectively.That setback didn’t deter Adidas. Two days after Argentina were knocked out, Adidas extended their shirt sponsorship deal until 2022 for an undisclosed sum.But Brazil’s shock elimination to a Paraguay side that didn’t have a shot on goal until the 88th minute of the match was a blow for Brazil’s commercial partners.The five-time World Cup winner is sponsored by foreign multinationals such as Gillette, Volkswagen and Nestle and also by home-grown giants like Itau, Ambev, Tam airlines and Seara.Those sponsors cannot be happy at losing the exposure to Latin American markets they’re keen to conquer.The companies probably see such setbacks as inevitable and it is unlikely to affect their future relations with the national side.Their eyes are on the bigger prize – hosting the 2014 World Cup.For now, they’re no doubt taking each game as it comes.Related reading:

445;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-07-19T21:24:00Z;BM&FBovespa to issue depositary receipts;;Brazil’s BM&FBovespa will next week start offering depositary receipts in Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevron and seven other large US companies as the stock exchange struggles to lure more investors to the market.Concerns over inflation and government intervention in local companies such as Vale, the iron ore miner, have weighed on Brazil’s equity market over the past few months, making foreign stocks an attractive option.Itaú-Unibanco, Brazil’s biggest private sector bank, will emit from Monday so-called unsponsored Brazilian depositary receipts (BDRs) in 10 US-based companies, aimed at institutional investors.“This gives Brazilians a good way to diversify their investments and gives them access to top-notch global companies here in Brazil,” said Julio Ziegelmann, equity products managing director at BM&FBovespa.Unsponsored depositary receipts have become more popular than traditional BDRs since they are emitted by banks and do not require the underlying foreign company to comply with local regulations such as publishing financial results in Portuguese.After unsponsored BDRs were introduced late last year by Deutsche Bank, 30 US-based companies will now be traded in Brazil via this instrument as of Monday. By the beginning of next year, BM&FBovespa expects to offer about 100 unsponsored BDRs, including in European companies, Mr Ziegelmann said.However, volumes in this market remain very low. In May, only R$236,450 ($151,182) was traded via unsponsored BDRs.Brazil’s stock exchange has been under pressure to attract more investors to the whole market, with the index currently trading around a 14-month low. After hitting R$6.48bn last year, average daily equity volumes fell to R$6.07bn in May and R$5.91bn in June.“The market is worried about the inflation scenario and has started to bet on a more prolonged cycle of interest rate hikes … favouring fixed income instead,” said Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist with CM Capital Markets in São Paulo.Greater state interference in Brazil’s biggest companies has also weighed on the market, he said.“Concerns over Vale and Petrobras and the government’s intervention in their management have definitely also reduced investor appetite,” Rostagno said.

Meanwhile, the outdoor element of the campaign involves gritty posters and street art.It’s an effective way to stir national passions and the pirate crossbones logo captures the swashbuckling spirit of a tournament in which teams boasting some of the world’s best players can often be humiliated by lesser rivals.However, the campaign can strike the viewer as a little confusing – as if Nike’s “Copa Barrio” is some kind of spin-off amateur tournament or an attempt to rebrand the main event.

This time the whole sector isn’t just under pressure, it has fallen off a cliff.Reuters reports:China Dongxiang said over the weekend that it expected revenue to decline 45 per cent year on year for the first half, and its profit margin attributable to shareholders to fall to 17-19 per cent, from 37 per cent a year earlier, as it cuts back on sales to distributors in China to reduce inventory at the distributors’ end.And here’s what the sector is doing (charts are all for past 6 months):Li Ning’s troubles are relatively well documented – it has problems with distribution, and has billed itself as a relatively upscale brand where it has tried to compete with the global champions like Adidas and Nike, a tough sell for a Chinese brand.Its rivals too have distribution problems, but they could at least rely on the fact that they were cheaper, and so were competing less directly with the international brands.But while Dongxiang and Li Ning issued warnings to the market, ANTA came out with a positive affirmation of its targets in a July 7 conference call. Yet its shares have been as badly hit as the rest of the sector – falling almost 10 per cent on Monday.Perhaps in an economic environment characterised by rising inflation and slowing growth, a new pair of basketball sneakers might be the first thing crossed off the shopping list.
448;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-07-02T02:44:10Z;Marketers target web mavens and connectors;;It is often a few key people who have the power to spread a message far and wide. On Facebook, and in our living, breathing lives, we know those who are always up on the latest trend and quick to share their opinion about it. We also know people who really do seem to have 953 friends, ranging from corporate executives to Buddhist meditation gurus.Author Malcolm Gladwell described these two personalities in his book The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, and Facebook has taken note. The “maven” character he describes is an expert in a certain field, be it technology, music or cleaning products. A “connector” is a person with many friends and acquaintances in disparate yet overlapping social networks. Working together, connectors have great power to spread the advice and opinions of mavens.On Facebook, this power is amplified – with just a few keystrokes from a few key people, opinions about Nike running shoes and videos of double rainbows go viral, reaching huge audiences in next to no time.This is critical for marketers who want to identify those few people who share opinions with hundreds of thousands of others. Facebook has indicated that it is working on locating mavens and connectors in the vast social graph of Facebook users. This is information that brands will be hugely interested in knowing.“You can’t think of Facebook as a messaging medium,” said Charlene Li, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “You have to think of it as an influencing medium.”Marketers often refer to the 80/20 rule: for example, 20 per cent of shoppers write 80 per cent of product reviews that end up on Facebook, said Brett Hurt, chief executive of Bazaarvoice, which hosts product reviews and helps market brands on social media.Knowing who those 20 per cent are can significantly accelerate a marketing campaign and cut its cost, or help solve a problem before a negative message reaches the masses. Mr Hurt gives the example of 3M, the conglomerate that owns the Post-it Notes, Scotch Tape and Scotch-Brite brands. They noticed negative reviews on Facebook of a dish scrubber – users complained that the rubber bottom was leaking soap. 3M recalled the scrubbers and fixed the problem in its manufacturing. “That process normally takes 12 months,” he says. “Now it takes three.”Marketers want to harness this power proactively, too, in advertising campaigns. If they can identify the specific section of the population that knows, cares and posts Facebook messages about their product, they can tailor a campaign specifically to them, then let the network effects take care of the rest.
449;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
450;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-06-29T19:58:42Z;Europe’s banks buoyed by Athens ‘yes’ vote;;European equity investors on Wednesday built on the gains made in the previous two sessions, but the Greek parliament’s approval of fresh austerity measures met with mixed reactions.Relief that Greece should now receive a further €12bn in aid, together with the efforts of the region’s banks to roll over the maturities on their holdings of Greek debt, helped keep the main equity indices at session highs.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended up 1.7 per cent at 1,098.71. But the Athens General index gave up some ground in afternoon trade, ending just 0.5 per cent higher after a day of volatile trade, against the backdrop of violence on the streets.Greek banks, which had been higher in anticipation of the “yes” vote, were sold off during the afternoon as investors were pleased to book some profit from the sector. National Bank of Greece finished 1.8 per cent lower at €4.81, while EFG Eurobank lost 1.5 per cent to €3.21.Europe’s primary banking stocks hung on to gains, however, as their efforts to address the crisis with plans to roll over their holdings into longer maturities met with some approval.“Although of course it does not provide new funds to Greece, it potentially provides the element of ‘private sector participation’ needed to give political cover to official bail-outs,” said Daniel Davies at Credit Suisse.In France, BNP Paribas rose 1.7 per cent to €52, while Société Générale added 2.6 per cent to €39.82.Resource stocks gained some welcome relief from recent selling on the combined fears of globally slowing growth and falling commodity prices.French mining group Eramet was the Eurofirst leader, climbing 6.3 per cent to €224.65, while Swedish zinc and copper group Boliden gained 4 per cent to SKr113.90.Higher oil prices helped lift the region’s energy producers and explorers. Swedish oil explorer Lundin Petroleum gained 7.2 per cent to SKr83.95, while Norwegian rival DNO International rose 4.8 per cent to NKr5.82.The region’s sportswear producers climbed, continuing their favourable reaction to better than expected results from Nike of the US, which said on Tuesday it was increasing its prices as margins fell.Shares in Adidas climbed 2.2 per cent to €54.95, while smaller domestic rival Puma added 2.4 per cent to €215.40.
451;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-06-28T20:32:21Z;Wall St gains prompt hopes for larger rally;;"Nike led the consumer discretionary sector higher after the sportswear retailer reported strong quarterly earnings, while the wider markets saw another positive session leaving some commentators asking whether US equities were in now the early stages of a larger rally.Nike was up 10.1 per cent to $89.90 after reporting a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, bringing the stock back into positive territory for the year.The results came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter due to higher commodity costs.Nike reported strong sales growth in China and the US despite increasing its prices earlier in the year, raising hopes that other high-end retailers may also be able pass on higher costs.The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.9 per cent, one of the best performing indices on Wall Street, while the S&P retail sector climbed 1.6 per cent.Among the other stocks in the retail sector to perform strongly were Home Depot, which was up 2.4 per cent to $36.06, and Tiffany, which added 2 per cent
to $77.93.These gains helped the S&P 500 index put on 1.3 per cent to 1,296.67 in a low volume session, adding to the 0.9 per cent rise on Monday.The 2.2 per cent bounce in the S&P so far this week comes after nearly two straight months of losses on the index, prompting some commentators to argue that US equities may have found their bottom.“The markets may retest the lows of last week, but I think we have reached a bottom and the worst of the declines are over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The “risk-on” trade dominated in the session, leading the materials, energy and technology sectors sharply higher along with the consumer discretionaries.The technology sector was helped by a number of ratings upgrades, leaving the sector up 1.3 per cent.LinkedIn, the business focused social networking site, was up 11.2 per cent to $84.91 after a raft of banks put “buy” and “outperform” ratings on the stock as they began coverage following its initial public offering last month.Monster Worldwide added 9.9 per cent to $14.91, also lifted by a number of positive analysts reports.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Microsoft put on 2.4 per cent $25.80, adding to the 3.7 per cent gained in the previous session, as the company unveiled an online version of its Office software suite.The S&P energy sector was the best performing on Wall Street, rising 2.7 per cent as Schlumberger was up 4.6 per cent to $84.32 while Halliburton put on 5.3 per cent to $48.70.Among the materials stocks to gain were Freeport-McMoRan, which added 3.6 per cent to $50.45 and Cliff Natural Resources, which climbed 2.1 per cent to $89.21. The S&P materials index was up 1.8 per cent, benefiting from a rise in commodity prices.These gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.2 per cent to 12,188.69 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite add 1.5 per cent to 2,729.31.Overall sentiment was also helped by hopes that the Greek parliament would vote to approve some key austerity measures on Wednesday.Economic data from the session was mixed. The Case-Shiller index recorded a rare monthly rise in home prices in April on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in house prices may have abated somewhat.But the index was down 4 per cent from the previous year and it was not clear how much of the gain was due to recent higher temperatures. “It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather,” said the report from Case-Shiller.Still, the S&P homebuilding index up 1.2 per cent in the session and Pulte group , the largest US housebuilder by sales, added 2.7 per cent to $7.89.In other economic news, data from the conference board found that US consumer confidence had fallen in June to its lowest since November 2010.The Vix volatility index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 5.4 per cent to 19.45 in the session, as traders turned more optimistic.In corporate news, Accenture gained 3.2 per cent to $59.66 after Standard & Poor’s said the consulting company would replace Marshall & Ilsley in the S&P 500 index next month when the regional bank’s takeover by Bank of Montreal is expected to close."
452;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-06-22T22:48:56Z;“Brands are over-obsessed with fans,” says Facebook adsales chief;;Facebook’s Carolyn Everson, its vice president of global marketing solutions, put on an impressive display before the admen at the Cannes Lions festival on Wednesday, addressing many of the issues about which marketers have been concerned.As well as announcing a new “client council” to guide Facebook’s monetisation strategy, ahead of its expected initial public offering next year, Ms Everson talked about new ad formats, acknowledged some of the company’s shortcomings in providing metrics and accessibility to its “small” staff, and argued that Facebook – despite its modest, unintrusive ad formats – was a great platform for creativity.“Facebook is one of the most incredible platforms for creativity out there – I don’t want you to think about it as just a display ad,” she told the Don Drapers in the audience. Facebook won’t do homepage takeovers (in spite of being asked repeatedly to do so) but it is a medium for “telling stories”, she said.“Brands have asked us a lot: ‘Is this really about display advertising? Do I just buy ads on Facebook?’ When they ask that question I realise we have so much education to do.”Ms Everson made one of the most impressive pitches I’ve seen at Cannes in four years of covering the Lions.She showed off case studies from the likes of JetBlue, Samsung and Nike, whose “Write the Future” campaign saw 2.5bn “ad views”. In a canned video, one of Nike’s digital marketing folk called Facebook’s Like button “the most valuable thing on the internet”.But in a humble moment (Facebook has in the past been accused of arrogance by agencies) Ms Everson admitted that putting harder figures than these around the returns from Facebook campaigns is something the company needs to improve.“The measurement has to go beyond the click. That is a very 10-year-old display-ad-oriented model. It is much more than that. We need to be measuring brand affinity, awareness, intent to purchase.”But if not the click, is it the fan that’s important? Surprisingly not:“The basic level [of marketing on Facebook] is getting your page and getting fans. I think some brands are probably over-obsessed with fans and just focus on numbers of fans. As an industry we need to move away from that. Fans are totally important, of course they are – you want to know people who love your brand. But there’s more – people expect more from a brand, they want to have a conversation.”As Facebook works with its client council and other ad agencies to figure all this out, Ms Everson reassured Cannes delegates that it would not go into competition with them, a criticism sometimes levelled at arch-rival Google:“We are not going to be building an in-house agency. We are not going to compete with you. One of our mantras is to stay small. We want to empower you.”If Facebook can live up to the expectations set by Ms Everson, it could be very empowering for both the company and its clients.
453;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-06-14T11:29:10Z;Sports lifestyle sector hot to trot;;VF Corp’s $2.3bn acquisition of Timberland, and the fact that it sees the brand as one way to increase its “apparel content,” as CEO Eric Wiseman said to Women’s Wear Daily, has my trend sensors all-aflutter. After all, it was one thing listening to François-Henri Pinault talk about his acquisition of California surf brand Volcom earlier this year in a bid to increase the “sports lifestyle” component of PPR. But now there’s another big group getting pro-active in the sector. We have competition!Seems to me, some far-sighted execs have the idea that literal sportswear may be the next big thing in consumer communities: names with a set of values attached (and perhaps values more in line with a large chunk of the post-recession world than those of the high-end), a slightly lower price tag to the products, and hence potentially mega volumes. Nike has pretty much owned this space for a long time, king of its west coast castle, but now it seems others are attempting to scale the walls. I’m going to watch this space. How about you?

455;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-06-07T17:24:14Z;Foxconn, worth less than toilet paper;;"Ouch. First the suicides. Then the plant explosion. Now Foxconn International, the scandal-hit Taiwanese company that toils in the shadow of high-profile clients such as Apple, is being stripped of its blue-chip status after it was dropped on Tuesday from Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index.In its place will be AIA, Asia’s largest listed life insurer and Hengan, a company best known in mainland China for its Space 7 brand of sanitary napkins and its Anerle brand of baby diapers. Hengan is also a major producer of toilet tissue.The demotion caps a stunning reversal of fortunes for Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, which at its peak in 2006 had a market capitalisation of over HK$194bn ($25bn), when its shares were changing hands at HK$27 a pop.On Tuesday, the stock closed at HK$3.90 a share.Foxconn made its fortune on the back of the ‘Made in China’ model, producing goods for export at ultra-low costs in high volume and in quick time. But this business model came unstuck last year after a spat of highly publicised suicides at its Shenzhen campus forced the company to rise wages and put an end to its factory-town model. Both of these moves have squeezed the company’s narrow margins. Rising commodity prices have done the same.As a result, the company posted a net loss of $218m (£135m) in 2010, compared with net income of $38.6m the year before.Foxconn is the not the first export-focus company to be demoted from the Hang Seng.Yue Yuen, another Taiwanese company that no one has heard of, but which makes a third of the world’s shoes for brands such as Nike and Timberland, was relegated from the index in 2009.This leaves, Li & Fung, which sources goods for the likes of Wal-Mart, as the only export-focused company left on the index. But for how much longer?Li & Fung’s stock is easily one of the worst performing on the Hang Seng so far this year, having dropped some 23 per cent since January.Unlike Foxconn, Li is not a contract manufacturer. Instead it makes its money from commissions taken from both the companies from which it sources products and the mainly western retailers it supplies with those same products. Yet it has not been immune to some of the ailments that have afflicted Foxconn. As the FT reports, retail sales in Europe and the US have slowed, while rising labour costs in China – the source of almost three-fifths of its goods – and worldwide inflation in plastics and cotton prices have put its suppliers under pressure.It is telling then, and perhaps a sign of the times, that Foxconn will be replaced by AIA and Hengan both of which target China as a market for their products rather than as a place to make goods cheaply for export.Related reading:

I’m sure it will help re-evaluate the sport and inspire more youngsters to play tennis,” Sun said after Saturday’s final.As with many other sports, such as soccer and volleyball, Chinese male players lag far behind their female compatriots. No Chinese man has ever played in a Grand Slam and the highest-ranked male Chinese player is Bai Yan, ranked number 354.Ms Li is now ranked number 4 in the world and is almost certain to be offered a string of new endorsement deals, in addition to her existing contracts with the likes of Nike and Haagen-Dazs ice-cream.Her victory may also lead to a rethink of the way the Soviet-style Chinese state sports machine develops national sporting stars for individual sports like tennis.In 2008, Ms Li and a handful of other promising players were released from the onerous duties imposed by the official state tennis system and allowed to choose their own coaches and support team.They were also allowed to keep more of their winnings, with the cut going to the official Chinese federation reduced from 65 per cent to just 12 per cent, which means Ms Li will be able to keep the bulk of the €1.2m in prize money from Saturday’s final.The lure of riches, on top of national glory, will be another factor promoting the sport of tennis in China.Related reading:

457;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-05-30T17:41:52Z;Adidas forecasts £100m of 2012 Games sales;;Adidas, the official sportswear partner of the 2012 Olympic Games, said it is expecting to sell £100m worth of Games merchandise.This amounts to one-10th of the London Organising Committee’s (Locog) expected sales for 2012 merchandise and surpasses sales of Adidas’s 2008 Beijing Olympic merchandise.Adidas has not revealed its sales figures from the Beijing Games, saying only that its merchandise sales would be higher in 2012 given the “different scope” of its marketing and merchandising rights.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said: “For the first time we not only have exclusive rights for the official launch products but we also have the rights for the non-branded products, which obviously gives us the opportunity to be more commercial and to sell the products through other distribution channels.”Branded products featuring both the 2012 and Adidas logos will be sold through traditional channels such as sports retailers and department stores, but event-branded products without the Adidas logo will be sold through additional channels such as airport and tourist shops, as well as supermarkets.Mr Hainer said he hopes to use 2012 as a springboard to overtake Nike as the sportswear market leader in the UK – one of Adidas’s four largest markets in Europe.Adidas has about 15 per cent of the UK sportswear market, trailing Nike by about 2-3 per cent, said Adidas’s UK managing director, Gil Steyaert.In addition to outfitting the volunteers, technical staff and officials for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Adidas is supplying the uniforms for Team GB and has appointed Stella McCartney as creative director, hoping to add to the “desirability” of the brand in the UK.“When we talk about the Olympics and engagement, we’re not talking about the 17 days of the Games. We take it as a four-year period,” said Mr Hainer.Adidas became a domestic tier one Olympics sponsor in 2007 and is investing about £100m in its marketing activities for the Games over a five-year period.The company is specifically looking to grow its share of the London market and the running category. Mr Steyaert said it aims to capture the top spot in the UK market by 2015 “at the latest”.Europe’s largest sporting goods company is hoping Team GB will build on its success at the Beijing Games to help drive visibility and sales, and says one advantage it will have in 2012 is being closer to its retail partners in Europe, enabling it to react quickly to market needs.Locog has said it expects total London 2012 merchandise sales to be about £1bn and is hoping to raise £80m from merchandise and licensing to fund the staging of the Games.Mr Steyaert said, “We’ve probably never had a plan of this magnitude and of this innovative level.”
458;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-05-29T19:33:09Z;GPG sales put Coats in an enviable position;Incentive package for thread supplier’s executives;Senior executives at Coats, the world’s leading supplier of threads to the clothing trade, stand to make up to $100m under an incentive scheme when the company re-emerges on the London Stock Exchange after its 2003 delisting.Owner Guinness Peat Group, the corporate raider that took Coats private nearly a decade ago, has agreed to a stepped incentive package which offers its subsidiary’s chief executive Paul Forman and other senior employees up to 15 per cent of any increase in the company’s value above $1.35bn over the next three years.Coats, an original FTSE 30 constituent, was acquired by GPG for £414m ($683m) in 2003 but was only valued internally at about £320m at the end of December 2010. Mr Forman, formerly chief executive of Low & Bonar, the FTSE Small Cap industrial materials maker, took over as Coats chief executive at the end of 2009.Blake Nixon, director of Coats who expects to move from an executive to a non-executive director’s role at GPG in July, said the total amount available would be capped at 9.9 per cent of GPG’s own capitalisation at the time of the scheme’s close on 31 March 2014.This would create a maximum pay-out of about $100m for top executives should Coats perform successfully as the sole operational interest of GPG following its controversial decision to sell off its remaining assets in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.Mr Nixon defended the generous terms of the incentive scheme, describing it as typical of those enjoyed at many private equity firms or at the riskier end of publicly listed companies. He added that if top managers hit the top limit it would represent a “win-win situation” for shareholders.He said the early completion of asset sales by GPG could see the name of the remaining listed entity being changed to that of the rump Coats business.The sell-off strategy was agreed after a number of boardroom splits over the past two years and a shareholder revolt in the wake of a fall in the valuation of its business in 2008 and 2009.GPG continues to trade at a discount of about a third to its own valuation of £993m for its investments, which apart from Coats spans interests in financial services, food processing, building services and food distribution. More than half the portfolio by value is held in companies based in Australia or New Zealand.GPG is committed to returning £75m from asset sales to shareholders this year. Among UK investments being prepared for sale by GPG are stakes in Newbury Racecourse, brewers Young’s and Co, Daniel Thwaites and Shepherd Neame, car delivery company Autologic and Nationwide Accident Repair Services.Under its current owners, Coats – an early investor in China, Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific centres of textile and clothes making – has reduced its exposure to the US and Europe.GPG argues that Coats, which supplies threads to 22 per cent of the global apparel market, can continue to improve sales and profits.Last year turnover rose from $1.41bn to $1.58bn with pre-tax profits jumping from $36m to $107m,Gap, Levi Strauss jeans, Adidas, Marks and Spencer, Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch are among those brands using Coats threads and yarns, which are used in the manufacturing of clothing, sports shoes, furniture and bedding as well as airbags and safety belts in cars, and parachutes used by Nasa space vehicles.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
460;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-05-27T22:36:55Z;Man Utd players shine as Glazers stay in shade;;How much is Manchester United worth? One year ago, England’s best-known club faced problems. The trophy cabinet displayed just the minor prize of the League Cup.Fans were in mutinous mood, disgruntled with the Glazer family, the secretive owners, and draping themselves defiantly in the club’s original colours of green and gold. Off the pitch, wealthy supporters were contemplating a takeover offer. Concluding that the club’s value was in decline, they thought an offer of more than £1bn ($1.65bn) was appropriate.Things look somewhat different now. The Premier League title is won and on Saturday United face Barcelona at Wembley in the Champions League final. Success on the pitch has stilled the protests. Rumours of a sale have died away, which is just as well. It is thought the Glazers now believe the club to be worth more than £2bn – not because United are playing well but because the club is starting to exploit its brand value. The club is not for sale anyway.The Florida-based Glazers, who will be at Wembley in force, will never be popular. Their ownership will for ever be associated with the £790m leveraged buy-out that six years after their takeover and a year after refinancing, still leaves the club with gross debt north of £500m.Andy Green, a United blogger and noted Glazer critic, says: “The club has been appalling, noticeably at trying to communicate any positive image. If people like me are wrong, why not engage with us?”Last year’s £500m bond issue was the most public unveiling of the family’s strategy but it also exposed them to charges that cash could be used to pay down their debts, among them the onerous high-interest payment-in-kind notes.These were repaid at the end of last year, though exactly by whom is not known. As far as the Glazers are concerned, it is no one else’s business. United declined to comment.The Glazers are not ones to change tack because of unpopularity. But the hiring of a PR agency suggests they are sensitive to criticism that they have failed to explain their vision.The owners may not find a more opportune time to creep out from behind their cloak of silence. They bought United because as owners of a sports franchise in the US, they believed they had the knowledge to tap its brand commercially. With a team of 70 sales and marketing staff in London, the United brand is on the move, scouring the globe, cutting deals with companies eager to piggyback on its global recognition.United have 14m subscribers to its Facebook page, a database of 10m and a fan base that at its core may number 140m. In addition to Aon, its shirt sponsor, and Nike, its technical partner, the club has 11 official sponsors in sectors such as tour operators, airlines, automotives and beer. Categories to fill include energy and handsets.It wants to exploit its MUTV broadcasting operation, which it brought back in-house last year, and push content such as highlights through digital media.Commercial deals other than Aon may hit £40m, compared with £24m last year. United is also about to recover the rights to financial services it gave to AIG, its former shirt sponsor.That means a revenue share for the club for every United credit and debit card sign-up fee and transaction. And it will see the upcoming renewal of the Nike contract as an opportunity to extract better terms.Other revenue streams are less flexible. United will make £60m from its cut of English and European TV rights deals but these are in the negotiating hands of others. Gate receipts are not immune from recession – the strategy is to hold what it has.Mr Green acknowledges that the commercial revenues are “very useful” – “but it doesn’t change the fact that you have £40m-odd walking out the door just to pay the interest”.United’s cash position is heading towards £150m, from which the club should have £60m to disperse as it sees fit.Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager, may like to get his hands on some of that. But the prospects of the Glazers taking dividend payments that the refinancing made possible are scarce, says Mr Green, given the adverse reaction it would generate. “The green and gold campaign had an effect,” he says.One area in which the Glazers will not mind spending some cash is the bonuses players will get if they win at Wembley. Might victory prompt some family members to stand in front of a TV microphone to thank the fans for their support? That would be a stretch.
461;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-05-25T20:42:30Z;Big hitters put Li Ning in trouble;;Li Ning, the Chinese sportswear brand, has run into trouble with its strategy of challenging the dominance of foreign brands in the domestic market, with the unexpected departure of three senior executives this week adding to concerns about slowing sales.Li Ning’s shares have fallen 9 per cent in Hong Kong since the company said on Tuesday that its chief operating officer, chief marketing officer and the head of e-commerce had resigned to pursue “personal career development”. Despite protestations from the company that the departures would have no impact on operations, they were seen as further evidence of problems with the company’s rebranding strategy.The company, which changed its logo and slogan last year as part of a brand “revitalisation”, is struggling to maintain its strong position in the highly competitive Chinese sportswear market. Wei Xiaopo, China sportswear analyst at CLSA, says management expects third-quarter pre-orders to fall by high single-digits at Li Ning, while rival Anta will see pre-order growth of 20 per cent for the same period.Named after the gymnast who lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Li Ning last year tied with Adidas for second place in the Chinese sportswear market after Nike.Li Ning’s decision to take its products upmarket and compete head to head with foreign brands is viewed as an important test case for Beijing’s ambitions to rebrand China as more than just a cheap manufacturing base. Chinese sportswear brands such as Li Ning and the more downmarket Anta – which increased its sales from almost nothing in 2004 to nearly Rmb6bn ($924m) in 2009 – have made great strides to improve their profiles in recent years, analysts say.But Li Ning “are the only one of the Chinese sports brands that tried to play against the big guys, and they are just getting hammered by it,” said Paul French of Access Asia, a retail consultancy in Shanghai. The company is also struggling to restructure its inefficient distribution network, which includes too many small operators, according to analysts. By the end of the year, Li Ning is expected to consolidate about 400 of more than 1,700 distributors that only operate a single franchised store.Forrest Chan, consumer analyst at CCB International Securities, said both the restructuring and the rebranding are depressing performance in the short term.Mr Wei of CLSA said it would take time to deal with these challenges. “Li Ning’s effort to elevate its brand calls for a set of fundamental yet challenging transformations,” including a transformation in products, retail channels and inventory flow management, he said. “In our view, it takes time and high costs to achieve such multiple and challenging tasks in a synchronised fashion.”Li Ning’s problems also reflect broader difficulties with the sportswear sector, says Tan Heng Hong, research analyst at Access Asia. “The high-growth era of the sports apparel business has finally come to an end. Consumers, especially in major cities, are turning to casual wear and this is where money can be made, not sportswear.”With additional reporting by Shirley Chen

The first item in his in-tray will be how to respond to the rise of e-readers and tablet devices, which he knows only too well are hampering physical book sales. Still, his last role did contain some lighter moments. Last May, Mr Sim oversaw the launch of the new Waterstone’s logo, helping devise the slogan “Feel every word”.

When he took over from his combative predecessor Willie Walsh in January, he struck a conciliatory tone in a letter sent to the airline’s staff, telling them they were at the heart of the BA brand.Mr Williams, who joined BA in 1998 from Reckitt & Colman as group treasurer and head of tax, has since seen the airline go through industry turbulence.He was heavily involved in restructuring the airline’s finances after the 9/11 attacks and, as Mr Walsh’s right-hand man, helped steady the cockpit, selling off businesses, negotiating BA’s tie-ups with Iberia and American Airlines and dealing with its £3.7bn pension deficit.After studying history and archaeology at the University of Liverpool, Mr Williams trained as an accountant with Arthur Andersen. He has held several senior management roles and was treasurer for Apple Computer Europe, based in Paris, and Boots.Married, with two grown-up children, he enjoys the theatre and cinema.people@ft.com
463;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
464;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-04-29T19:22:50Z;Global sports groups circle Titleist golf brand;;Global sports groups are circling the Titleist golf brand, which sponsors European Ryder Cup player Rory McIlroy, ahead of a May deadline for bids for the business, which is being sold by Fortune Brands of the US.Adidas and the Japanese owner of the Srixon golf brand were expected to submit offers for the unit, which trades as Acushnet Company, by the May 9 deadline, said people familiar with the process.Callaway, the US-listed golf company, may also team up with a private equity group to submit a bid.Acushnet, whose Titleist balls are used by two-thirds of professional golfers, was expected to generate interest from other private equity buyers, said people close to the deal.The business could be valued at between $1bn to $1.2bn, although some cautioned that those estimates were the top-end of the likely range.A smaller group of sponsored players use its clubs, gloves and Footjoy shoes, including 21-year old Mr McIlroy from Northern Ireland, who missed out on winning the Masters tournament in Augusta this month when having led the competition, his final round went awry.Fortune Brands, Adidas, Callaway and SRI Sports, which owns the Srixon brand and is itself owned by Japan’s Sumitomo Rubber Industries, declined to comment.Fortune, which also owns Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark bourbon and has a housing products division, said in December that it would split itself into three, having come under fire from activist investor Bill Ackman.The company said this week that its plans were progressing well.The golf business has been earmarked for a sale or spin-off, followed by a separation of the home and security business.The standalone spirits business would then trade as Beam Inc, the company said, adding it had no plans to change the Acushnet name, which came from the Massachusetts town where the first Titleist ball was made in 1935.Fortune Brands’ stock has risen more than 20 per cent during the past six months, as investors cheered the plan to split.The shares were trading at $65.03 on Friday afternoon.People familiar with the matter said the golf business made about $100m a year in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Achieving the discussed price for the business would rely on potential buyers believing they see significant growth in the popularity of golf, they added.The business tends to fluctuate with the economic cycle, but buyers may also see opportunity for growth in countries such as China, as the emerging middle class embraces golf as a leisure and networking pursuit.

The likes of Twitter and Facebook are now actively used by the world’s biggest companies as sophisticated marketing tools. It is not just that customers are targeted for campaigns and promotions or that behavioural data can be mined. Numerous studies have shown relationships between online activity (the cyberspace equivalent of word-of-mouth) and consumer behaviour.For example, the volume of internet chat has been shown to predict book sales (Gruhl, Kumar, Nova and Tomkins). Another study last year (Asur and Haberman) concluded that short-term box-office sales can be forecast from the rate at which people tweet about a film. A recent research paper by Arthur O’Connor at Pace University goes a step further, finding a correlation between the fan counts of Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike on social media sites and those companies’ respective share prices over a 10-month period.The positive spin for marketers who might leap on such studies is that growing fan counts are a sign of increased brand loyalty and, thus, brand performance and ultimately revenues. Other things remaining constant, higher revenues should boost stock prices. Perhaps. Research is in its infancy on how social media affect customer knowledge, retention, motivation, and decision making. At the very least, advertising and marketing departments can get closer to, and gather more information about, their end customers than ever before.But correlations are one thing and causality quite another. Perhaps a company’s share price is rising at the same time as it is adding thousands of new Facebook followers because of a huge marketing push elsewhere. Also, do social media reduce the chance of a brand surviving a big negative shock? The internet is unambiguously good for consumers. But it remains a double-edged sword for companies.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
466;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Barclays Private Equity buys into The Mill;;Barclays Private Equity has agreed to buy a majority stake in The Mill, a London-based provider of digital visual effects for television and internet ad campaigns including Nike’s “Write the Future” and Lynx’s “Even Angels Will Fall”.The Mill is being sold by Carlyle Group, the US private equity firm, in a deal valuing the London company at £119m ($193m).Set up in 1990, The Mill received early backing from the rock band U2. It has grown rapidly in the past few years as more big consumer brands have turned to software providers to produce TV, internet and other moving image campaigns to save costs while still creating dramatic special effects.It is the second time in a month that a London-based, post-production digital effects company has changed hands. In March, Carlyle agreed to buy a majority stake in The Foundry, whose software helped to create special effects for films such as Avatar, from Advent Venture Partners and other shareholders.Robin Shenfield, chief executive and co-founder of The Mill, said the group had benefited from the recent rebound in TV and internet advertising and a push by brands to create more uniform and globally consistent ad campaigns. He said a push further into the US, where it now makes about 40 per cent of its sales, had also paid off.Steven Silvester, director at Barclays Private Equity, said The Mill would seek to exploit opportunities in Asia and Latin America and was well positioned to take advantage of expected growth in moving image ads on smart phones and in video games.Carlyle bought The Mill from 3i in February 2007 for an undisclosed sum that analysts at the time estimated to be more than £50m. Revenues have nearly doubled in the past four years, rising from £40m in 2007 to £74.2m in the year to December 2010. The Mill has 625 staff across offices in London, New York, Los Angeles and Singapore.Robert Easton, managing director and co-head of Carlyle Europe Technology Partners, said that having been very bullish on the digital effects industry as a whole, he had still been impressed by the rate of growth at The Mill.As well as working with advertising companies such as Omnicon, WPP, Publicis and Interpublic, The Mill has won plaudits for its work on films and TV dramas such as the BBC’s Doctor Who.Mr Shenfield, co-founder, Pat Joseph, chief creative officer, and the rest of the management team will stay on at The Mill and retain a “significant minority stake” in the company.Mr Shenfield said The Mill had helped produce 24 of the ads for this year’s Super Bowl in the US.It has also recently worked on Ford’s global launch of the new Focus, which used one advertising campaign worldwide.

Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed but one person familiar with the deal said that Publicis made a modest profit on the sale.Mr Freud sold a 50.1 per cent stake to Publicis in 2005 in a deal that valued his company at €70m-€80m, according to people familiar with the situation at the time. Revenues grew 23 per cent to £33.0m last year.The agency, the UK’s largest consumer PR firm, has clients including Asda, Sony and Nike. The FT first reported that the deal was in negotiations in November last year.“I enjoyed working with Matthew and I have a lot of respect for his skills,” said Olivier Fleurot, chief executive of MSL Group, Publicis’ communications and events network. “We wish him success in his future endeavours.”Nicola Howson, chief executive of Freud Communications, said: “We are grateful for the support of Publicis Groupe as a shareholder since 2005 and look forward to our future as an independently owned company.”The deal is not the first time that Freud Communications has been taken over by a larger marketing services group, only to extricate itself several years later. The agency was bought by Abbott Mead Vickers, a British ad agency, in 1994. After AMV was acquired by Omnicom, Mr Freud and his team bought back the agency in 2001.Mr Freud did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month saw the departure of another senior British executive from Publicis when Richard Pinder, chief operating officer of Publicis Worldwide, its largest agency, was replaced by Jean-Yves Naouri. Maurice Lévy, Publicis Groupe chief executive, told the FT that Mr Naouri “is clearly in a leading position for winning the race” to take over as chief when he steps down in the coming years.

469;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-04-08T16:40:32Z;Towering example of endorsement;;At 6ft 8”, LeBron James stands head and shoulders above the other stars of US sport.With annual earnings from endorsements alone of more than $40m from a range of sponsors that includes McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, Mr James also packs a financial punch few can match.His biggest deal is with Nike, which has had a relationship with the 25 year-old since 2003, when it signed the then teenager to a seven-year contract worth $90m.In Mr James, Nike saw the perfect replacement for Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls star who propelled the company to global recognition and success simply by wearing its shoes on the basketball court.Adidas and Reebok also courted Mr James but Nike won his signature after presenting him with a ready-made shoe bearing his name and a short commercial made by Spike Lee.Since then, he has blossomed into the most exciting player of his generation, with one of the most fearsome dunk shots in the sport.But he has yet to win a national title. This was the motivation behind his move last year from his home town team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, to the much better equipped Miami Heat.He agonised over the switch for weeks, entertaining offers from teams in New York and Chicago. He even received personal pleas from, among others, Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, such is his appeal.Fenway Sports Group will hope some of that stardust translates into financial success for Liverpool Football Club. “LeBron is more than just a great athlete, he’s a brand,” says Paul Wachter, who advises the star on finance and investments.Basketball players have more clout than other sports stars, he adds, and there is no bigger star than Mr James. “Basketball is different. It’s cool, it appeals to kids and there are only five guys on the court. It has a natural appeal for endorsement.”
470;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-04-07T01:41:53Z;Basketball star takes Liverpool FC stake;;LeBron James, the Miami Heat basketball star who is one of the world’s most bankable athletes, has become an unlikely part-owner of Liverpool football club, after striking a deal with Fenway Sports Group, the company that owns the team.James’s LRMR Marketing & Branding group will take a “minority interest” in the club as part of a sponsorship deal agreed with Fenway Sports Management, a subsidiary of FSG. Financial terms were not disclosed.English football has received a wave of investment from the US, ranging from the Glazer family, which owns Manchester United, to Randy Lerner, who owns Aston Villa.But the deal between James and FSG, which acquired Liverpool last year for £300m ($490m), marks the first time that a top-tier athlete has joined the soccer fray.Tom Werner, chairman of FSG, told the Financial Times that bringing the star together with Liverpool football club would open up new Asian markets and potential partners for the company.“This will only increase the awareness of Liverpool around the world,” he said. “When we [take Liverpool] to Asia this summer we can also talk to companies about LeBron. It’s another way to enter the conversation.”Maverick Carter, James’s business partner, told the Financial Times that the star was well aware of Liverpool’s heritage and history as one of the most successful clubs in English football.“We’ve seen the fans singing ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ on YouTube,” he said. “FSG own and operate big global sports brands,” he added, pointing to FSG’s ownership of the Boston Red Sox and Roush Fenway Racing, a Nascar team. “We fold right into that.”While Liverpool’s fortunes have waned, FSG aims to re-establish the club as a force to compete with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea.As part of its deal with James, the company will work on global marketing and sponsorship opportunities for the star, who made headlines last year when he moved from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat.The switch became a national event, with Mike Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, issuing a personal appeal to the star to move to the New York Knicks instead.James, seen by many in basketball as the heir apparent to Michael Jordan, the sport’s biggest ever star, has one of the most lucrative sponsorship contracts in sport, with Nike paying him more than $90m to wear the company’s shoes.
471;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-04-04T19:52:04Z;China consumer goods: Left on the shelf;Multinationals face growing problems in the world’s most sought-after consumer market;"Hair damp and skin aglow, women stream out of a nondescript Communist party-owned block in a drowsy Shanghai neighbourhood where the most colourful attraction appears to be the Disney-branded English lessons on offer on the building’s lower floors.But the women too are the object of a big multinational’s attentions: they have just been given a cosmetics pampering by Unilever. The diligent market research undertaken by the Anglo-Dutch consumer group is just one testament to changes in the way multinationals tackle the world’s most sought-after consumer market.Where once multinationals shipped out tubs of creams and potions invented in the US or Europe, they are now taking their cue from Chinese consumers – in some cases bringing the resultant products back to the west. From how Chinese make soup to the way they wash their hair is thus the stuff of increasing commercial scrutiny. Hence the mock-up salon the women had been invited to in central Shanghai.All these questions will only become more acute as multinationals embark, more or less en masse, on the next step of what Patrice Bula, until recently Nestlé’s top man in China, refers to as “the last big industrial adventure”.The hunt for new consumers is shifting west, away from the multinationals’ relative comfort zone of the big coastal cities and into areas where distribution, logistics and consumer behaviour are all less than certain. Nationwide, the question is whether the western groups’ juiced-up research and development budgets and consumer insight efforts are enough. Competition in China is escalating – and some of the strongest rivals are local companies that barely featured a few years ago.Domestic groups are eating into multinationals’ market share, in part by playing to national pride and claiming superior knowledge of local consumers – but partly also by taking a leaf out of the foreign rivals’ books, poaching their staff and ramping up their own research, development and marketing.Many of these local groups have deep (sometimes government-backed) pockets and equally big ambitions: witness Bright Food’s appearance as bidder for foreign food groups from United Biscuits of the UK to France’s Yoplait. Further proof of multinationals’ determination to make a go of China emerged last week when Unilever bowed to pressure from Beijing to rescind planned price rises in the interest of reining in inflation.“There’s a big change in the landscape,” says Mr Bula, now back at Nestlé’s Swiss headquarters as head of strategic business units. He points to the rise of “powerful” mainland companies such as Wahaha, the beverages group, and Taiwan’s noodle-maker Tingyi. “If we want to emulate [anyone] and rally the troops at Nestlé, we compare ourselves with these people, because they have some of the competences and skills we want to have,” he says.No wonder. A cursory glance around any supermarket is enough to show China is shaping up to be the world’s biggest grocery market within just three years. The choice, even by western standards, is staggering. At a hangar-proportioned Carrefour outlet in suburban Shanghai, there are enough soft drink varieties to allow a customer to try something new every day for a year – and still not have exhausted the different herbal teas, flavoured milks, fruit and vegetable concoctions or slimming beverages on the shelves.“Can Chinese companies innovate? The evidence is, sure they can. They are incredibly entrepreneurial,” says Mitch Barns, China president of Nielsen, the information and analytics group.They can also win the hearts and stomachs of Chinese consumers – throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Alan Jope, Unilever’s ebullient chairman for China. Elsewhere in the world, he says, Unilever ranks number one or two in laundry. In China, however, both his group and Procter & Gamble, its US rival, play second fiddle to a brace of formerly state-owned domestic manufacturers. Nice Group and Guangzhou Liby Enterprise control a combined 35 per cent of a sector including powdered and liquid detergents, by Euromonitor’s numbers, while Unilever and P&G have around 8.5 per cent each.The story is similar in tea. Guangdong Strong’s kookily named U-loveit instant tea helped that group rack up tea sales of Rmb4.2bn ($642m) in 2009. The youthful group doubled its market share to just under 20 per cent in two years. Unilever, by contrast, has seen its share virtually halved since 2006 to below 4 per cent.“These locals are increasingly sophisticated, not at all cheap-and-cheerful,” says Mr Jope. In ice cream – another category where Unilever and Nestlé are outranked by locals – they are “highly innovative”, he says.…Unsurprisingly, the locals concur. Shanghai Jahwa United has had a chequered history but Ge Wenyao, its chairman, reckons the cosmetics maker’s time has come to knock foreign rivals off the shelves. “P&G entered China in the 1990s when consumers did not have much choice, so thought they liked the brand. But now there are multiple brands and they cannot tell whether another brand is good or not,” he says. “Now Chinese companies have grown and learnt a lot from foreign companies. They now have better marketing and feel much more confident. Look at our Herborist brand [of skincare]. It is priced higher than P&G’s brand and last year our sales revenues increased by 50 per cent.”There is other evidence. Multinationals are losing their allure for employees, suggesting citizens, too, increasingly see their future with local companies. The number of candidates preferring to work for foreign-owned companies dropped 10 percentage points in the past four years to 73 per cent of jobseekers, according to a survey by Manpower.This reflects narrowing pay differentials, as local companies enhance salaries and benefits. But there is also a sense of greater opportunity. Joseph Tcheng, managing director for greater China at Diageo, the UK drinks group, tells of how he recruited a marketing director from Nike of the US: one year later he was out of the door because a local sports company with big ambitions lured him away with the promise of equity in its planned initial public offering.“He said: ‘I love working for you but here’s an offer I cannot refuse: I get shares and to work with a local entrepreneur who wants to take his company global.’”Indeed, vibrant competition is putting pressure on virtually every link of the chain, beginning with the supply of raw materials. If commodity price inflation is a scourge across the globe, in China the issue is even more acute. In an effort to source inputs from potatoes to sugar in a country where agriculture is woefully inefficient and farming is far from a top career choice, multinationals are themselves turning to the land.PepsiCo’s Chinese farms supply roughly 40 per cent of the potatoes used in its Lay’s crisps. Nestlé counts 25,000 dairy farmers among its suppliers – all of whom the Swiss group deals with directly – and Associated British Foods’ Chinese operations are so focused on procuring sugar beet that Tony Cheung, managing director for the British Sugar unit, says he regards the farmer as his top priority. Poaching of suppliers is rampant as farmers jump ship for a bigger cheque.The scars of competition show through, too, in advertising, distribution and, ultimately, landing a place in shoppers’ baskets. Multinationals spend about 50 per cent more on advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales in China compared with the rest of the world. Unilever globally, for example, spends about 15 per cent of sales on advertising and promotion; in China it is half as much again. P&G, media analysts say, spends 25 per cent of sales. “It’s a land grab, right?” says Unilever’s Mr Jope. “Everyone’s investing today for share tomorrow and that’s what drives up media rates.” Media cost inflation, analysts say, is running at around 20 per cent.…All these dynamics are shifting, however, as multinationals embark on their next big step in China – taking them away from the relative comfort zone of big coastal cities such as Shanghai and Beijing and into mushrooming metropolises deeper in the country. That means tackling virtually virgin terrain where populations are big and getting richer but where the pipework – logistics, distribution and modern retail – lags behind.“Third- and fourth-tier cities are twice as big as the first- and second-tier ones in terms of population, and the growth rate [is] twice as fast. So that’s where the big opportunity is,” says Nielsen’s Mr Barns. “China is going to add more megacities in the central and western parts of the country and urbanise 200m more people.”L’Oréal of France is among those striving to sell more face potions and shampoos in these cities, which it plans to do in part by following the big international retailers including France’s Carrefour and Walmart of the US, as well as using smaller cosmetics stores and third-party distributors. Alexis Perakis-Valat, L’Oréal’s chief executive, enthuses about a recent trip to Anshan in the north-eastern province of Liaoning; in the week he was there, two huge department stores opened. “There was so much dynamism,” he says. “And there are 300 Anshans in China.”But access is tough beyond the top 30-40 cities, says Ted Hurley of Nielsen. “It’s a pure distribution game. Get your product on the shelf any way you can. But getting a foot on the ground takes a lot of time and money.” Otherwise it means an increasing reliance on third-party distributors – and thus an element of ceding control. Multinationals’ products turn up in the most unlikely mom-and-pop stores – in places where the usually ubiquitous cars are absent and children look goggle-eyed at foreigners. But it is also true that you can pick up a flat bottle of Coke or a chocolate bar well past its expiry date.It also requires new consumer insights: the Shanghai office worker with her swishing hair is a long way from the farmer in the north-east who has no more than a bucket of water – and probably substantially less time – to complete her ablutions.Besides, in fast-changing China, even the Shanghai consumer recruits for trying out cosmetics could prove an endangered species. Andrew Steel, director at Unilever’s consumer research institute – where 30,000 Chinese a year try everything from soup to shampoo and where staff include anthropologists, psychologists and sociologists – has his problems too. “Now people are living in condominiums, it’s much harder for agencies to go knocking on doors to find consumers for testing.”"

The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
473;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-03-18T00:10:50Z;Commodity costs squeeze profits at Nike;;Nike, the US sportswear company, said that it would raise prices on many of its products as higher commodity prices dented third-quarter profit margins.The company said on Thursday that its net income rose 5 per cent to $523m, or $1.08 a share, up from $497m, or $1.01 a year earlier. The results failed to meet the expectations of Wall Street analysts and sent Nike shares down nearly 6 per cent to $80.59 in after-hours trading in New York.Higher freight and product costs cut away at Nike’s gross margin, which fell to 45.8 per cent.“You’ll see us increase prices for many of our products to help offset some of the downward pressure on gross margins,” Charles Denson, Nike brand president, said on a call with analysts. “Over the coming seasons, we’ll approach these pricing actions on a style-by-style, market-by-market basis.”Nike said that in the past, it has been more “surgical” with its price increases but this year would take raise prices more aggressively on a wider variety of products.Revenues remained strong in the latest quarter, rising by 7.1 per cent to $5.1bn. Sales in emerging markets rose by 19 per cent, outpacing those in the US and Europe.Nike’s fastest growing market was China, where sales surged by 21 per cent, driven by strong demand for apparel.Mark Parker, Nike’s chief executive, said that China and other developing countries were demonstrating “vigorous growth”, while the US and Europe lagged behind.“It’s clear that consumers remain under pressure from high unemployment and emerging inflation,” Mr Parker said. “While no one has a crystal ball, we do know higher costs will continue to affect our profitability in the near term.”
474;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-02-28T22:42:48Z;Big groups back global eco-label scheme;;Some of the world’s biggest clothing and footwear manufacturers and retailers are working on a scheme to allow shirts, trousers and shoes sold globally to be labelled with tags depicting to what degree the items’ production and usage would impact the environment.The scheme amounts to one of the most ambitious efforts to create a set of standards for different types of manufactured products that would measure the effect on the environment of the steps involved in the production of an item of clothing.Companies backing the scheme include Walmart, Gap, JC Penney, Levi Strauss, Nike, Marks and Spencer, Adidas, H&M and Li & Fung, a big textile supplier.Alex Tomey, vice-president of product development for clothing at US retailer Walmart, said: “No one company has got all the answers in terms of pulling together the correct way of measuring all the variables involved, which is why we decided on a collaborative approach.”He said Walmart hoped one of the results of the programme would be to create a “credible” system for devising ecological labels for products that could be attached to items in retail outlets within the next five years.Under the plans of the companies backing the scheme, the labels could be used to inform consumers about how much impact the production of an item has on the environment. One idea, for instance, would be to draw up a set of indices to cover areas such as the energy used in different stages of production and to what degree toxic chemicals were used at any part of the manufacturing chain.Other parts of the scheme would look at the impact of discarding items of clothing after they are used, and how much this affects the environment, such as through adding to landfill sites or polluting the water supply.Lorrie Vogel, an environmental expert at US sportswear producer Nike, said that she felt the labelling idea was “feasible” although it would take “a lot of work” to create the correct appropriate methodology.John Elkington, chairman of Volans, a UK-based environmental group, said he welcomed the general principles behind the project. But he added: “For the scheme to work as well as it might this will require the companies involved in the programme to be willing to be extremely open about their manufacturing processes.”

476;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-02-14T22:00:38Z;Why Project Merlin was a banking triumph;Bankers have ensured that none of them suffers any competitive disadvantage;When companies get together to deal with an outcry over their behaviour, they usually have three goals: to get the public off their backs, to head off government action and to ensure that any sacrifices they make are shared by their competitors. All three are difficult to achieve and most corporate collaborators settle for one or two.My own industry’s attempt at collaboration is a self-regulation body called the Press Complaints Commission. It has done little to reduce public distaste for the profession. A recent survey by Edelman, the public relations company, found that only 22 per cent of people in the UK trusted the media. Nor has the PCC tamed the rougher practitioners of the trade. Competition for scoops drives some to excess, as the mobile phone hacking scandal shows. But the PCC’s existence has, so far, dissuaded successive UK administrations from introducing privacy laws. (Governments’ fear of the press turning on them helps too.)Organisations such as the Fair Labor Association, set up in 1999 to end sweatshop conditions in factories worldwide, have done better. There are still occasional protests over working conditions, but by pointing to the FLA set-up, which includes unannounced visits by outside monitors, companies can argue they are taking action. Proposed US legislation prohibiting the sale of sweatshop-made goods has not got anywhere. And because competing companies – signatories include Nike, Adidas and Puma – have signed the same code, they have some assurance they will share whatever costs compliance brings.The UK banks that started Project Merlin, whose outcome was announced last week, knew the scale of their task. The Edelman survey showed that the British despised the banks even more than they disliked the media. Only 16 per cent of those surveyed trusted banks, down from 46 per cent in 2008.Some bankers seemed to grasp why. Stephen Green, then chairman of HSBC, said in 2009: “The perception that some have taken pay and bonuses in vast multiples of the remuneration of ordinary hard-working and socially valuable people – for indulging in an alchemy which has blown up in their faces and required huge bail-outs at prodigious cost to the taxpayer – has ignited fury around the world.”The banks involved in Project Merlin – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland – said in their statement last week that they “understand the public mood” and would “show responsibility on pay in 2010”. But with Bob Diamond, Barclays’ chief executive, and Stuart Gulliver, head of HSBC, expected to receive bonuses of close to £10m, the public mood they claim to understand is unlikely to soften. Indeed, people will probably conclude that Project Merlin has allowed bankers to escape scot-free.The UK government claimed to have got something in return: an undertaking by the banks to lend significantly more, especially to small and medium-sized businesses, than they did last year. But few believe the targets laid out in Project Merlin will be reached, with one banker describing the idea as “completely barking mad”.So if Project Merlin is unlikely to defuse public anger, will it manage to head off government action? There has already been some: the government pre-empted Project Merlin by increasing the levy on banks’ balance sheets by £800m to a projected £2.5bn. And while bankers’ ability to earn huge sums seems unaffected, the way they take their bonuses will be subject to Europe-wide restrictions, with only 20 per cent payable immediately in cash.The bankers have, however, triumphantly achieved the corporate collaborators’ third goal of ensuring that none of them suffers any competitive disadvantage: they will all continue to be handsomely remunerated.Could it have been any different? Auret van Heerden, the FLA’s chief executive, says collaborative efforts require a strong third party if they are to succeed. In his organisation’s case, it was then-US-president Bill Clinton who got the companies together at the White House and “held their feet to the fire”.There was another party to Project Merlin – the UK government – but its power proved limited. The British bankers regard themselves as part of a global industry. With US rivals such as Lloyd Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs, and James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, receiving bonuses valued at $12.6m and $7.4m respectively, they were never likely to settle for much less. The bankers would have countered any attempt to force them to do so with threats to depart for Switzerland or Hong Kong. They got most of what they wanted, except getting the public off their backs. And while that may be hard to bear, money is a powerful analgesic.michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/michaelskapinker
477;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;JD Sports in talks to buy rival JJB;;JD Sports Fashion has confirmed it is in talks about a possible takeover bid for rival JJB Sports, pushing shares in the troubled sportswear retailer up more than 17 per cent.Bury-based JD Sports said on Wednesday that it was in “early stage discussions with the board of JJB Sports”, but added there was “no certainty that an offer will be made …nor as to the terms”.Struggling JJB has been the target of takeover speculation for some time, while its shares have fallen 80 per cent in the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalisation of just £30m.JD Sports has a market capitalisation of more than £400m and roughly twice the number of JJB’s 250 outlets, which sell sports clothing, shoes and equipment.“The highly preliminary nature of these discussions is such that there can be no certainty that any offer will be made or as to the terms of any offer,” said JJB.In a separate announcement, JJB announced a long-awaited placing to raise £31.5m from shareholders.The placing, which is not underwritten, will give the business enough cash to continue as a going concern until the end of March. After that, “the company could experience a funding shortfall”, it said.Slightly more than half of the placing proceeds will be used to make “immediate payments to creditors” with the balance funding trading losses and enabling the purchase of new stock.Quarterly covenant tests on its £25m facility with Bank of Scotland have been waived following placing letters pledging support from JJB’s five main shareholders, which include US fund Harris Associates and activist investor Crystal Amber.The emergency fundraising comes only a year after JJB staved off administration through a £100m equity raising and renegotiated leases.JJB admitted its previous business plan, which assumed that a further £110m could be raised to fund the group for the next 12 months, was “unlikely to be fundable”. Its lenders have set a deadline of February 24 for a revised business plan and the company said it was considering “a number of restructuring options” including store closures and a further company voluntary agreement to be implemented by the end of April.JJB also updated the market on Christmas trading, revealing an 11.1 per cent drop in like-for-like sales in the five weeks to January 23. That compares with a robust performance from JD Sports, which saw analysts upgrade profit estimates after it reported a 2.5 per cent like-for-like sales rise in January.JD Sports shares fell 3½p to 844p, while JJB Sports added 0.8p to 5.4p.
478;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-01-21T19:37:03Z;Li Ning;A neat illustration of China’s struggle to build brands of its own;"“China’s Nike”? Not exactly. If Li Ning continues on its current trajectory, the similarities will start and end with the swoosh-alike logo.Named after its gymnast founder, the Beijing-based sports manufacturer/retailer increased revenues by nine times, and earnings-per-share by ten, between 2002 and 2009. By January last year, though, as Li Ning opened its first US store in Portland, Oregon – Nike’s backyard – the flaws in the routine were becoming obvious.Li Ning had built the biggest sports brand sales network in China, with 7,748 outlets. Just 474 were managed directly, though; 60 per cent of the remainder were run by about 2000 inexperienced retailers who were reluctant to cut prices to shift old inventory, leaving little room for new, higher-priced products. In June, confronting persistently weak order books, Li Ning gave itself a slightly different logo and a new slogan, “Make the change”.Investors did just that, selling not just Li Ning (down 42 per cent since then) but rival manufacturer/retailers with similar distribution problems like Anta, Xtep and 361 Degrees. The only Chinese sportswear stock in positive territory over that period is pure retailer Pou Sheng (+37 per cent), a big outlet for Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Puma.Handing favoured franchisees another few percentage points of wholesale discounts could protect Li Ning’s market share while it rationalises domestic distribution over the next two years. But Nike will also be spending heavily in what is easily its most profitable territory. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse data on Chinese sportswear consumption shows the scale of Li Ning’s challenge. Preferences switch from domestic brands to foreign as monthly household income exceeds Rmb7000 ($1000). In sneakers and vests, as in bigger-ticket items, China’s would-be global champions seem a long way from conquering their own turf, let alone anyone else’s.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
479;NKE;Nike Inc;2011-01-07T22:02:47Z;Next big trend: 3D eyewear;;"With 3D set to take over the entertainment world this year (33 leap-off-the-screen films are already penned for release), it is bound to become part of our style experience too.Eyewear group Marchon is this month transforming the low-fi cardboard image of previous 3D eyewear via a new line of stylish, multifunctional sunglasses created in collaboration with Nike, Calvin Klein Eyewear, and Nautica brands (from $195) each capable of viewing 3D images and also being worn day-to-day.David Johnson, president of Marchon3D, says: “It’s not so much that 3D is an eye-popping experience, it’s that it enhances the entire process of viewing anything. There’s more impact and viewers are much more personally involved.”Johnson says the glasses have been two years in the making. “We had the challenge of making the lenses curved and not disturbing vision,” he says. “Pretty soon 3D will be a part of everyday life. 3D movies already generate more than $300m a year. Ninety million new LCD TV sets are sold at the moment each year. The possibilities are endless.”Marchon isn’t the only fashion company getting excited about 3D. This month Gucci is also introducing 3D glasses ($225) in its US stores, although they are only designed for use in the theatre (apparently there’s a market for people who still want to look good, even in the dark).Brands have been enthusiastic over the marketing and consumer possibilities of 3D for a while, including it in everything from their online retail sites to their store windows.“3D is a way of adding texture and interactivity,” says Manfred Abraham, director of strategy at Interbrand, the branding consultancy. “For fashion brands, online retail particularly has never done justice to what’s in store. This narrows the gap between reality and the screen.”This autumn designer Marc Ecko has tapped actress Lindsay Lohan (in hologram form) to appear in his online campaign.Last February Burberry streamed its London catwalk show live in 3D to stores in New York, Los Angeles, Dubai, Paris and Tokyo, prompting a slew of other brands to follow. Last month Saks Fifth Avenue used state-of-the-art projection technology to create a 3D snow scene as a holiday window display.In September, London-based gallery Haunch of Venison hosted KM3D-1, a short 3D film by director Baillie Walsh featuring Kate Moss throwing Swarovski crystals dramatically at the screen (this can be viewed online at LVMH’s web-zine nowness.com); Gucci Guilty’s recent ad campaign directed by Frank Miller was launched with a 3D screening; director Wim Wenders has collaborated with Rolex on a 3D sponsored film; and Armani A|X Exchange has introduced a 3D music video for its autumn campaign (accompanying 3D print ads appeared in magazines, complete with non-fashion 3D glasses).Ralph Lauren has gone further, hosting a 4D (3D but with scent) event last November to celebrate the anniversary of its online store. In front of a 1,000-strong audience at both its Bond Street and Madison Avenue flagships, the brand projected a 3D film on to the buildings, adding moving models that exited the boutiques and seemed to walk out into the audience. It also featured a hologram of Ralph himself waving from an upstairs window and a giant bottle of the brand’s Big Pony fragrances, which appeared as spritzes of the scent were simultaneously pumped out to the audience.“It helps that 3D is much cheaper and easier to produce now,” says Interbrand’s Abraham. “It used to be expensive but now 3D effects can be applied to anything.” Even what you wear. Did you see it coming?"
480;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-12-27T19:33:49Z;Open innovation powers growth;;Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, is an acknowledged global industry leader in new consumer product innovation. According to data from IRI, the market research firm, it produced five of the top 10 US non-food product launches in 2009. But as it pursues its drive to add another 1bn customers to the estimated 4bn it already reaches, Bob McDonald, its chief executive, says that the road to more innovation should increasingly embrace other people’s good ideas.“We need bigger innovations that create more value,” Mr McDonald told this year’s annual gathering and awards event for companies and research institutions that work with P&G. “We want you to come to us with your big ideas first.”It is now commonplace for consumer goods companies to work with outside partners and to pursue “open innovation” (see panel). But P&G may be the one that has made the largest deliberate effort to expand its reach since the launch of its Connect & Develop programme in 2001 by A.G. Lafley, its then chief executive.In an attempt to open up the company and to end its resistance to innovations “not invented here”, Mr Lafley said he wanted at least 50 per cent of its new products to involve an outside partner. The company met that goal four years later and the share is now about 60 per cent.External co-operation has delivered a stream of successful “big idea” products. Last year’s IRI list included Tide Total Care, a premium version of its Tide detergent, which was number two by sales on IRI’s 2009 top 10 non-food products launch list. It was developed with external research from Sweden’s University of Lund and from two small chemical companies. P&G’s Always Infinity feminine care brand was at number eight – it uses a patented absorbent foam material from a manufacturing process developed with an external partner.P&G’s list of partners includes other large corporations, such as food groups ConAgra and General Mills, and rivals, including its Glad brand plastic bag joint venture with Clorox, set up in 2003. Its most unexpected government research partner may be the Los Alamos National Lab, the US defence technology research centre. Los Alamos initially helped P&G to regulate the production of the absorbent gel used in nappies, using theoretical data analysis systems developed for weapons technology.But part of P&G’s challenge is now learning how to work better with small and medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs. “That to me is the largest barrier,” says Bruce Brown, P&G’s chief technology officer who also oversees about $2bn of spending on its internal R&D. “How do we really learn to work better with some of the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs?”Jeff Weedman, head of the Connect & Develop programme, says: “It’s normal for new partners to have a concern that they will be overwhelmed” and that “some small entrepreneurs don’t have the patience to work through” P&G’s exhaustive procedures.Even when the company begins to explore potential co-operation, it may still decide a proposed partnership does not work. “We most often say no thank you, even in proactive searches,” says Mr Weedman. “Fairly routinely . . . we’ll refer them on to other companies, up to and including competitors. We never want them to have an excuse to not call us first.”Mr McDonald has now called for the value of the Connect & Develop programme’s contribution to annual sales growth to triple by 2015, so that products launched with outsiders account for $3bn of annual sales growth, up from $1bn now. At current growth rates, the target would raise the share of new annual sales growth from the initiative from about 25 per cent to more than 60 per cent.Mr Brown says the target marks a second stage in the programme’s development, after a first stage that managed to create the cultural change sought, but risked becoming a “tick the box issue”.“Instead of just focusing on the number [of external partnerships], let’s focus on the value we can create,” he says.“When we get those really, really big ideas, we want to scale them more quickly across the company and use them in more places across the company.”Shekhar Mitra, head of research and development for P&G’s global beauty and grooming business, recalls that a decade ago P&G was not even regularly scanning related research work.“When we started to change our culture, we found out ‘Holy cow! There’s a world of minds out there that can bring innovation to us’,” he says.He was involved in one of the programme’s early success stories, the creation of its Olay Regenerist anti-ageing creams, which was built around molecular peptides developed by Sederma, a French company, part of the Croda group.“As a small company, we had little chance of getting in there until P&G switched its policy,” says Karl Lintner, who headed Sederma at the time.Sederma has worked with many of P&G’s global rivals too, and says that potential partners with large corporations need to realise that “sometimes – like with most bigger companies – things take longer than you think, so it’s a bit frustrating”.The Olay brand is also involved in one of the company’s latest product launches, in partnership with Syneron, an Israeli technology company, that has developed a patented anti-wrinkle beauty salon treatment called ReFirme. After four years of joint development with Syneron, P&G’s business in Canada has started selling its Olay Professional ReFirme treatment for C$250 (US$248).P&G is also seeking approval for the product in both the US and the UK, a demonstration of what Mr Weedman says is its ability to deliver the kind of rapid growth and scale that would have taken a smaller company years or decades to attain on its own.“When we decide we are going to take something global, we have the wherewithal,” he says. “If you get through working with P&G and it makes sense, when we go global, you will go global. And it will be very quick.”
481;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-12-23T19:15:22Z;Collective is striding into new territories;;Chinese consumers have already demonstrated that they will pay more than $100 for a pair of Adidas or Nike sports shoes. Matt Rubel, chief executive of Collective Brands, the US shoe brands company, is hoping they may be prepared to spend about half as much for children’s shoes.“We look at China as an emerging market, but an emerging market of people that have money,” Mr Rubel says of the decision to launch its Stride Rite children’s shoe brand in China.The first Stride Rite store in China opened this month in Hong Kong, run by Li & Fung Retailing, a private entity not linked to the listed sourcing and branded company of the same name, under a partnership that plans to expand across to mainland China.Marketing in the mainland will not focus on price – the shoes sell for about $50 a pair in the US – but on the assumption that Chinese parents will be encouraged to spend on a brand that has built its reputation around safeguarding children’s feet with proper fitting shoes.Collective’s plans come as a flurry of foreign consumer product brands are expanding in the Chinese market, hopeful of benefiting from China’s rising domestic spending. A survey by Boston Consulting Group identified apparel and shoes as one of six product groups on which middle class and affluent Chinese consumers plan to spend more.Bata, the multinational low-cost shoe group, already has a large presence with close to 250 retail outlets around the country.Collective’s China launch is part of a wider drive for international sales growth. This summer, the company, whose other businesses include the Keds, Saucony and Sperry brands, and Payless ShoeSource, the US discount fashion shoe retailer, opened a new European headquarters in Amsterdam, and a new showroom for wholesale customers in London.It is also planning to open at least 700 new franchised Payless stores over the next five years in emerging markets, more than doubling the number of existing international stores.The drive is in part a response to the limits of domestic growth. Christopher Svezia, analyst at Susquehanna Investment, an equity research company, says that the mature state of the Payless business in the US is likely to lead it to remain focused just on remodelling its stores, whilst shuffling and also shrinking its retail properties.But while Payless competes with Walmart, Target and other discounters on both price and its “fashion forward” styles, in many emerging markets it is regarded as an aspirational brand. The performance of its Latin American stores also outstrips the US, with operating margins of 10.5 per cent over the past year, compared to 6 per cent domestically.“For Payless, the theme is to find the emerging market who are moving from a lower income consumer to a middle income consumer economy, where the infrastructure is built, and where the local shoe retail market has not consolidated,” says Mr Rubel. But Collective has decided not to take Payless to China, where its low-cost fashion shoes would be up against intense competition from hundreds of local brands. Instead it will focus there on launching Stride Rite, a more expensive brand.After opening in the Gulf and Middle East in 2009, and in Russia and the Philippines this year, in 2011 new franchised Payless stores will open in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and in Mexico. In Mexico, its plans should result in 41 franchised stores opening in the next three years, with up to 300 in the country in the longer term. In the three south-east Asian countries Collective estimates it could eventually open at least 400 stores, in what it calls its “largest franchise market opportunity to date”.Mr Svezia says that with just a handful of franchised stores open, it is still too early to assess their likely impact on Collective. In the meantime, Wall Street remains focused on the company’s core US business, which has been hit by the impact of the economy on its lower income customers. Its shares are trading at about $21, down just over 5 per cent from the start of the year.
482;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-12-22T22:00:12Z;US stocks rally on economic data;;"US stocks closed at levels not seen since the crash of Lehman Brothers after data showed the US economy had grown faster than previously estimated in the third quarter.US economic growth rose at an annualised rate of 2.6 per cent, above the previous estimate of 2.5 per cent but below economist forecasts for an increase to 2.8 per cent. Investors chose to focus on the possibilities for future growth and Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, was optimistic about the prospects for growth in 2011.“At this stage, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter looks to be tracking at about a 3.5 per cent pace, and the first quarter is likely to enjoy even better growth owing to the initial beneficial effect of the payroll tax cut,” he said.He added that 3.5 per cent growth in the fourth quarter next year would not be “unreasonable”.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,258.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,559.49 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,671.48.Financials continued to lead the rally and were up 1.1 per cent.“They have been laggards throughout the year but there’s been a pick-up in M&A [mergers and acquisitions] activity in financials,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, who added that larger banks would benefit from an improvement in the US economy and a steepening of the yield curve.JPMorgan surged 2.8 per cent to $42.16 and Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.38. Regional banks continued to outperform their bigger brothers with Regions Financial soaring 7.1 per cent to $6.91, the most in the S&P 500, and Fifth Third Bancorp gaining 2.9 per cent to $14.71.Meanwhile, Nike was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, dropping 5.7 per cent to $877 after the sports brand’s future order figures were below analyst expectations, even though they forecast orders would rise 11 per cent. The company also said that it might have to increase prices on some items to offset the rising cost of cotton, labour and transport. But it added that while this would weigh on results in the second half of this fiscal year, the pressure should ease over the next 12 to 18 months.But earnings beat expectations in its second quarter. Analysts at FBR Capital Markets reiterated their “outperform” rating for the stock and raised its price target from $90 to $98.“Strong sales momentum and margin expansion continued in [the second quarter] as Nike exploits the power of its business model and brand strength to drive growth, not only through continued penetration of emerging global markets, its greatest opportunity, but also through impressive strength in mature markets,” they said.They added that the strength of the Nike brand should make it easier to pass along cost increases to the consumer.Walgreen jumped 5.5 per cent to $38.85 after the pharmacy chain posted a first-quarter profit that beat expectations. Prescription sales rose while the retailer opened stores at a slower pace, controlling costs.In technology, Dell edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $13.88 after it continued its expansion into cloud computing by buying medical archiving company InSite One for an undisclosed sum. Red Hat became the latest tech group to report its quarterly results. The seller of the Linux operating system slipped from its 52-week high, slumping
2.5 per cent to $46.70.Third-quarter revenue rose 21 per cent and earnings per share matched Wall Street’s expectations.The software maker followed Adobe and other technology companies and issued an optimistic outlook, forecasting profit and revenue above the average analyst expectationsElsewhere in technology, Microsoft said it was working on a version of its Windows operating systems for devices including tablet computers. Microsoft added 0.4 per cent to $28.19.But shares in Intel dipped 1 per cent to $20.89 because it was reported that Microsoft has plans to run the new version using chips from Intel’s UK rival Arm Holdings. US-listed shares in Arm surged 3.3 per cent to $20.43."
483;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-12-12T16:57:06Z;Collective Brands targets Indonesia;;US footwear group Collective Brands, which owns the Payless shoe stores chain, will open 15 franchised stores in Indonesia next year and is shifting a chunk of production away from China to south-east Asia’s largest economy, executives said.The stores are part of a big push by foreign companies, including Unilever, Nestlé and Toyota, to target Indonesia’s growing middle class, while the expansion of production reflects the strong rebound of the manufacturing sector after a decade of decline.Collective Brands has begun sourcing from Indonesian producers to reduce dependence on China, where costs are rising. Matt Rubel, chief executive, said the company expected steadily to raise output from subcontractors in Indonesia to about 12m pairs a year by 2015. “The utopia for one-stop sourcing for quality and low price has been China …but utopias never last,” Mr Rubel told the Financial Times in an interview. “Today we have to do more work in redeploying to wherever we can.”With China’s share of output at about 80 per cent, Mr Rubel said he expected that to fall to about 70 per cent over the next two years, and then to about 60 per cent. Collective Brands sold nearly 170m pairs of shoes in 2009, with revenues of $3.3bn.Nike, the world’s largest shoe brand company, has divided production among China, Vietnam and Indonesia since the 1990s. But China’s share has also edged down over the past three years, with Vietnam now accounting for 37 per cent of its sales, China 34 per cent and Indonesia 21 per cent.New Balance and Adidas also source millions of pairs of shoes from Indonesia every year. Moves such as Collective Brands’ could help the country surpass Vietnam this year as the world’s second-largest shoe manufacturer after China.Collective Brands, which operates 4,500 Payless stores in the US, reached a franchise agreement with PT Mitra Adiperkasa in October. The first Indonesian businesses will open in the second quarter of 2011 in Jakarta and Denpasar, Bali, according to Fetty Kwartati, corporate secretary. Stores are also planned in Malaysia and Singapore.After being virtually wiped out by the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia’s manufacturers are bouncing back, with the economy growing at 6 per cent. Shoe production is back at pre-crisis levels. In 2010, Indonesia is expected to make 300m pairs worth $2bn-$2.5bn, said Gita Wirjawan, head of the investment co-ordination board.But Indonesia’s production surge is not limited to shoes. Leading food and household product makers are aggressively ramping up in the country. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, will invest more than $400m by 2013.Nestlé of Switzerland is pouring $200m into Indonesian facilities this year.Astra International, which has roughly 50 per cent of the domestic car and motorbike market, is set to spend approximately $200m in 2010 and 2011.

He is married to Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch. Close to leading members of the Conservative party including David Cameron, he hosts famed Christmas parties, attracting guests including Mick Jagger.Mr Freud has made similar bids for independence in the past. In 1994, Freud Communications was acquired by Abbott Mead Vickers, then an independent UK advertising agency. After AMV was acquired by Omnicom, the US marketing services group, Mr Freud and his management partners bought back the firm in 2001.He also owns stakes in M&C Saatchi and Engine Group, two of the UK’s leading independent advertising agency groups.Freud Communications and Publicis Groupe declined to comment.
486;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-11-17T22:01:23Z;Another form of creative thinking;;Open innovation is one of those terms that is harder to explain the more you try. At first, it seems obvious: the phrase suggests the antithesis of buttoned-up research and development units or the “not invented here” mentality of big corporations.It resonates with the barrierless world of internet-based communication and information sharing. For some, it im­plies Wikipedia and Linux, the open-source software platform, vast bodies of knowledge assembled by armies of distributed innovators and creators – all driven by their own particular set of incentives.Henry Chesbrough, the Haas Business School professor who coined the term in 2003, is more specific. He says open innovation is a process that starts with looking outside the organisation as you think about things to do inside. It is about “using other people’s wheels” to get you moving. Or, to quote Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, it is a way of dealing with the fact that “not all the smart people in the world work for you”.Seven years after he came up with the idea, Prof Chesbrough says open innovation has gone through three significant phases. The first was the simplest, and involved bringing external ideas into a company’s own innovation process. This has become fairly widespread. Examples include Apple’s App Store, which allows developers to work on the iPhone and iPad platforms and thereby increase their value to users.Last year, Netflix of­fered $1m to anyone who could im­prove the quality of its film recommendations to users. The X Prize Foundation is running similar contests to stimulate advances in genomics, private space travel and alternative energy. Both contests try to draw the best minds in the world to problems they might otherwise ignore.During the past decade, Procter & Gamble has involved and acquired innovative products and processes from outside the company. It boasts that it has moved from “not invented here” defensiveness to an enthusiasm for “proudly found elsewhere”.The most glaring challenge to the open innovation model has been the development of Boeing’s Dreamliner 787 passenger aircraft. To cut costs, Boeing syndicated much of the design to outside companies, whose R&D spending would be recoup­ed as they became subcontractors to Boeing.Unfortunately, Prof Chesbrough says, “there were a lot of technical risks in the plane. When they put it all together, the plane didn’t fly. It wasn’t just a matter of control but of complexity.” Trying to be too open with such a complex project led to unforeseen integration problems.The second phase in open innovation involved companies making their unused ideas and technologies available to others. John Willbanks, who runs the Science Commons project at Creative Commons, a non-profit group that aims to make it easier to share and build on other people’s work, consistent with copyright laws, says: “In traditional innovation systems, big university departments or industrial R&D units generate research, then there is a systematic process to assess what to do with it.”But what happens in the majority of cases where the research fails to lead to commercialisation or even publication?“Big companies have so many worthwhile products that don’t go forward because they don’t move the needle financially,” he says. And moving these products out to a broader audience often seems more effort than it is worth as it involves lawyers, confidentiality and even the unpicking of patent law.Sage Bionetworks, a Seattle-based non-profit outfit, was spun out of Merck to try to do just this. Merck had spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars running data-driven models on disease and drug responses. When it realised no single company could either generate or make sense of all the data, it created Sage to take advantage of the best of open innovation.Sage in­vited groups of biologists to share its data in order to speed up the discovery process and produce more accurate forecasts. Companies can commission research from Sage but on condition that the results of that research go into the public domain after a year.The idea is that you take an area as rule-bound and difficult as pharmaceuticals research and speed it up by allowing people to share their research in the hope of one day maximising its financial and social return.Nike is pursuing a similar strategy with GreenXChange, which shares some of its technological innovations with others who might find uses for it. If Nike comes up with a marvellous new rubber for shoes, for example, it wants them to use it to make other life-enhancing products, without the usual contractual and IP hurdles.Hannah Jones, vice-president of sustainable innovation at Nike, says open innovation makes sense for the company as it tries to “solve complex issues that go way beyond our footprint”.Ten years ago, Nike found that some solvents used in making its shoes were toxic enough to require factory workers to wear protective gear. But not all did. To guarantee their safety, Nike could either in­­crease monitoring or make a harmless solvent. It did the latter and shared the recipe for the new solvent across its industry. “We’ve found there is a huge benefit to collaboration around clear, systemic issues,” she says. “We can compete in different ways. There has been a shift in the architecture of where we compete and where we collaborate.”Ms Jones admits that managing open innovation remains a work in pro­gress, a balancing act between the rigour required in any big corporation and the looseness inherent in open innovation.How do you ignite mash-ups and swarms around particular problems, and then make sense of the results? How do you decide where to invest when innovations are popping up everywhere?“All this is nascent,” says Ms Jones. “We shall embrace the failures and experiment wholeheartedly.”Gerald Barnett, director of the research technology enterprise initiative at the University of Washington, says managing open innovation is like “the Zen thing of holding fast or letting go. It is easy to hold on with white knuckles to your own process, and it’s also easy to just chuck it all over the fence to see what others can do with your work. But it’s in between that you have to use your judgment, and find out how you build a community of practitioners that finds value in what you have done and will give back.”Nike, he says, is “putting in play inventions it doesn’t have to”, in the hope that people can improve on them and that, one day, the company may reap some benefit, tangible or intangible. This, he adds, is exactly the right attitude.The final phase in open innovation, according to Prof Chesbrough, is new business models arising from opening up the process. He cites Bharti Airtel, the Indian mobile operator, which rather than building its own network of communication towers, shares those of its rivals. This model allowed it to build a bigger network with lower fixed-cost investment.Threadless is an American T-shirt company that invites people to design their own shirts and allows visitors to its website to vote on their favourites, which are then made and sold. Prof Chesbrough says investors have put a $100m valuation on the business. This model of customer communities driving a business is an example of what happens to business models when you open up innovation.Imagine the kinds of business that would emerge, says Mr Willbanks, if everyone had access to accurate data on biotech research around the world – or, say, energy consumption? If we could gather all the data on just the loss of energy in transmission lines, then make it freely available, hundreds of small service companies could enter the market providing energy-efficient solutions. It would create thousands of jobs and transform an industry.It is at this point that open innovation will become a truly revolutionary force.

DMMs do not get to see incoming orders before others, as specialists once did.But they are required under an “affirmative obligation” arrangement to buy shares in a falling market and sell in a rising market under certain circumstances, determined using a formula that is triggered under certain market conditions.DMMs also trade shares using their own funds - which is typical of proprietary traders such as Getco, which also engage in high-frequency trading strategies.Chicago-based Getco became the first proprietary trading firm of its kind to become a DMM in February, when it bought 350 “assignments” – that is, stock names or other types of securities linked to listed companies – from Barclays. The UK-based bank had itself just bought LaBranche, a long-standing DMM, but had to divest some of its assignments as part of that deal.Of Getco’s assignments, 234 are company stocks such as Nike, Bristol Myers Squibb, Mastercard, RBS, GlaxoSmithKline, Domino’s, Sotheby’s and Philip Morris International, for which Getco has market-making obligations.

Grossman has taken HSN from its roots in cheap jewellery and “yell-and-sell” presenters into an era of celebrity endorsements and tactical alliances, such as the recently announced deal with Sony Pictures to market products from the blockbuster Eat Pray Love.With a career marketing and strategy setting for upmarket brands including Polo Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger, Grossman has introduced glitz to the dowdy home-shopping scene. Within her first year, she dumped 12 brands she had never heard of and began to develop exclusive products for the channel.First-quarter sales rose 9 per cent on the same period in the previous year to $519m, still leaving HSN well below market leader QVC. Grossman has never seen size as her only benchmark: “I’m more a Mac than a PC,” she told BusinessWeek earlier this year.

Initially this will be in municipalities with as few as 500,000 people and then, by 2015, in cities with a population of just over 50,000, company officials said in Shanghai on Tuesday.“We will be in seventh tier cities by 2015,” said Christophe Bezu, Adidas managing director for greater China. At present, the company has 5,600 stores in 550 cities.The product mix in smaller cities will be chosen so that the entry price for consumers would be 15 per cent less than in Adidas’ existing shops in larger cities, he added. The company would be targeting “middle affluent” consumers with average disposable income of Rmb5,000 ($753) a month.Herbert Hainer, Adidas chief executive, predicted that the strategy would allow the German group to regain the number two market position that it recently lost to Li Ning, the Chinese sportswear manufacturer.Li Ning, named after the Olympic gymnast who lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, recently announced plans to take its brand upmarket to compete more directly with foreign brands like Adidas and the market leader Nike.Li Ning’s move up to second position could prove a seminal moment.Retail analysts see it as one of the first signs in the retail field that Chinese products can rebrand themselves as not just cheap but desirable.Li Ning has strong sales and distribution networks in the lower tier cities that Adidas hopes to penetrate.Mr Hainer dismissed Adidas’s recent problems in China as a purely temporary phenomenon related to overstocking in the run-up to the Olympics.Adidas China sales returned to growth in the third quarter, with currency-neutral sales rising 9 per cent year-on-year in China compared with 10 per cent for the group as a whole, he said.Mr Hainer predicted double digit sales growth in China over the next five years.Adidas made optimistic projections before the Beijing Olympics, predicting its China sales would exceed €1bn ($1.4bn) by this year. Mr Hainer now says that target will be reached next year.

Verdict: ()When basketball superstar LeBron James announced he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat, his fans were apoplectic. Their top player, who had spent all his professional career at the franchise, was turning his back on them.For him, it was about joining an NBA title contender. For Nike, it was a brand-building opportunity. Rather than drop a spokesman who had betrayed a portion of its consumers, they put him in a video aired on YouTube and TV. In the slick and witty production, the player asks repeatedly “What should I do?”, linking neatly to Nike’s strapline, Just Do It.Rise follows a Nike ad that featured golfer Tiger Woods in April. That effort, in the wake of scandal in his private life, was seen as manipulative and in bad taste – the “apology” featured the voice of the golfer’s dead father.Perhaps we can thank Nike’s relationship with footballer Eric Cantona for sowing the seeds for this sort of brand exercise. In 1995, Cantona kung-fu kicked a fan who had verbally abused him during a match. Nike’s response: an ad in which the player attacked racism in sport.Well done Nike, for taking ownership of these situations, and reminding us that this is one sports brand that knows how to squeeze every last drop of value out of its spokespeople."
491;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Chinese groups winning battle for talent;;"Multinational companies are losing their image as China’s best employers and are increasingly struggling to compete for local staff with mainland Chinese groups, according to research by Manpower, the US employment company.Management and human relations professionals in China say it is harder for foreign companies to attract and retain senior managers who are Chinese.In a study to be released on Wednesday, Manpower reports a sharp increase in Chinese job-seekers who say they prefer to work for Chinese companies.The news that Chinese groups are increasingly winning the talent wars comes at a time when many foreign companies complain that it is harder to do business in mainland China, because some government policies favour local companies and because domestic businesses are becoming more competitive.“With a reputation as ‘golden brands’, foreign companies have long been regarded by Chinese workers as highly desirable places to work. However, all that is starting to change,” says the report. The percentage of Chinese job seekers surveyed who said their first choice was a foreign company fell 10 per cent from a previous Manpower survey in 2006.Sixty per cent of management-level employees said a Chinese private-owned company would now be their first choice as an employer. “Foreign companies no longer have a reputation as the highest-paying employers,” the study says, noting that 43 per cent of job seekers view “better compensation” as the primary reason to favour a domestic company.Kent Kedl, of business consultancy Technomic Asia in Shanghai, said money was not the only reason. “Local companies are starting to gain market share in every industrial sector in China, and that makes them an exciting place to work,” he said.Many Chinese companies offer better career prospects, according to some mainland Chinese professionals. “It’s well known among Chinese staff working for foreign companies that there’s a ceiling in our career paths; when you reach a certain level you have little chance of being promoted further,” said one human resource professional who said he left General Electric when he hit that ceiling, and switched to a Chinese company.But Wilson Lam, senior HR director at Alibaba.com, who worked at Nike, said he thought the nationality of the company was not the deciding factor: “When you get to a senior level, people are not asking if you are a Chinese company or a western company, they are asking …whether the position itself is interesting.”Additional reporting by Shirley Chen"
492;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-11-08T23:29:20Z;Adidas targets US youngsters for sales;;Adidas is making US schoolchildren one of the main targets of its marketing drive as Europe’s biggest sporting goods maker tries to make up ground on Nike, its biggest rival.“We want to win the hearts and minds of high school kids,” Herbert Hainer, chief executive of Adidas, said on Monday as the company set out plans to increase annual sales by more than half to €17bn ($23.6bn) in the next five years.At an investor day in Germany, Adidas said it could increase profits more rapidly than sales, lifting earnings by a compound rate of 15 per cent annually until 2015, and would raise its operating margin – 9.6 per cent so far this year – to a sustainable level of 11 per cent.The ambitions sharpen a keen rivalry with US-based Nike, which Adidas said it would outgrow over the next five years to “lay the foundation for leadership in the sporting goods industry”. Mr Hainer said Adidas was in “a global two-horse race”, implicitly dismissing any threat from Puma, a rival from the same town and family origins as Adidas and which has its own growth plans under the ownership of PPR, the French luxury goods group.Adidas had sales of €10.3bn last year, which the company last week said should rise 8 per cent in 2010 to more than €11bn. By contrast, Nike had sales of $19bn in its most recent financial year to the end of May, while Puma wants to raise sales to €4bn within the next five years.Mr Hainer admitted Adidas was still “underdeveloped” in the US, one of three markets that are slated by Adidas to bring half of its sales growth, along with China and Russia – more usually thought of as emerging markets. “In the US we definitely have the biggest potential,” said Mr Hainer.The US had more than 16m high school students who spent far more than older students and accounted for 20 per cent of industry spending, Mr Hainer said. Adidas will push more of its products into shopping malls and target more spending at high school sports teams.Nike recently replaced Reebok, a brand owned by Adidas, as a sponsor of the US National Football League but Mr Hainer said Adidas needed to “build up from the bottom” in the market.In China, where Adidas’s growth stalled after 2008, Mr Hainer said Adidas had improved its store network and could regain market leadership in 2015. Adidas will open 2,500 stores over the next five years.Mr Hainer also said Adidas was “not interested in buying or acquiring an outdoor company” but wanted to increase its share of this market, particularly in Russia, where Adidas will open 300 stores over the next five years.Adidas shares rose 1.5 per cent to €46.98
493;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-11-04T09:49:25Z;Adidas confident of 2011 growth prospects;;Adidas, Europe’s biggest sports goods maker, gave its first indications of how economic recovery will extend into next year, saying it expects earnings growth of up to 15 per cent in 2011 after raising its guidance on 2010 earnings for the third time.The German company, which vies with Nike for leadership of the global sports goods market, said sales were up 10 per cent in the third quarter while operating profits rose 22 per cent.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said Adidas had “made an explosive comeback in 2010”. While there would be “headwinds” in 2011 from higher costs and currency volatility, earnings per share should increase by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, Adidas said. Sales growth is expected to be slower than that.A strong increase in sales at Adidas’ own retail stores – up 16 per cent year-on-year in the quarter – helped the company to improve its gross margins and operating margins. Adidas is expanding its own-store network and said sales from retail would rise this year at “a mid-teens rate”, having previously indicated a low-double-digit increase.Retail is the smaller of Adidas’s sales channels, accounting for about 20 per cent of group revenues. Wholesale sales, up 8 per cent so far this year without taking into effect the euro exchange rate, would rise in 2010 at a mid-single digit rate, Adidas said.Earnings per share would be between €2.68 and €2.70 this year, Adidas said. It had said in June that earnings would rise to at least €2.50 per share, having started the year estimating as little as €1.90 per share.Adidas’s gross margins were also helped by lower input costs and fewer clearance sales. The outlook for earnings is also being helped by lower interest charges, as Adidas’ net borrowing declined, and a lower tax rate than last year.Adidas said it grew in every market, including China, where it has struggled recently because of high levels of destocking of inventory. Sales in Europe’s emerging markets rose 16 per cent while North American sales were up 14 per cent, including a 25 per cent increase for Adidas’s once problematic Reebok brand.“The third quarter met our high expectations,” Mr Hainer said.So far this year Adidas sales are up 8 per cent to €9.1bn while net income is up from €226m to €560m.

495;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-10-26T20:52:22Z;An office looks good by looking simple;Too many workplaces smack of self-indulgence;"Is a workforce more productive in a wonderful building, or are the surroundings almost an irrelevance? When I visit someone in a splendid new office, two thoughts strike me: first, how pleasant it must be to occupy such comfortable accommodation; and second, how very expensive.As a business owner, spending your own cash on the rent and fit-out of an HQ, you should be acutely aware of the relative expense of good-looking space. It is the classic fixed overhead – and usually a long-term rigid commitment. In an era of relentless competition, stagnant revenues, rising costs and squeezed margins, lavishing large sums on palatial surroundings feels like a bad idea.As a case in point, in 2007 the highest office rent ever in London – and possibly the world – was paid by an Icelandic business for an office floor in Mayfair. That company is now bankrupt and being investigated by the police for suspected financial crimes.Yet there is a cohort of reputable brands that do feel the need to have super funky workplaces – and obviously feel they can afford them. A recent book, I Wish I Worked There!, describes the extraordinary offices of companies such as Google, Hasbro, Nike, Sony Music, Virgin and Urban Outfitters. Apparently, their environments “stimulate, enable reflection, promote collaboration and encourage play”. I accept that decent working conditions help in recruiting and retaining talent. But do on-site massage and basketball courts have such a positive influence over the efficiency and creativity of an enterprise, or are they just self-indulgent? It would be fun to labour on a campus like that – but I’m not sure I would get much work done.More typical are glittering tower blocks. They may look imposing, but I think they lack character and tend to crush the individuality of those slaving away in them. As Noel Coward said: “The higher the buildings, the lower the morals”. The managers of such facilities appear to be obsessed with security – entering some is as exasperating as travelling through an airport. And negotiating repeated layers of receptions, then waiting endlessly for elevators is tedium itself. The entire impression is of a bland, impersonal edifice, the epitome of a corporate anthill.It is curious how service organisations such as investment banks, accountants, lawyers and advertising agencies tend to lease ostentatious premises with profligate foyers, magnificent views and extravagant meeting rooms. Visiting clients must surely think: “My fees are paying for all this grandeur – am I getting good value from my supplier?”Basics such as location, size, heating, lighting and price are ultimately more important than appearance. The cleverest entrepreneurs with whom I’ve partnered have always taken space below their company’s means, because status symbols matter less to them than operating a lean business.Start-ups often find the best bet is shared space, incubators or serviced offices. They may not be plush, but they are flexible, and when you are focused on survival, you watch every penny and each long-term obligation. Moreover, in the digital age, many staff can work from home or on the move, with hot-desking a common feature of many outfits. Such circumstances are unlikely to be relaxing, but they are economical.I like well-designed commercial structures , and I appreciate high-quality offices. But too often such workplaces are an architect’s folly, built by developers to appeal to the vanity of conceited business leaders and planning officers. I do not think offices should be ugly or shoddy. But at heart such buildings are 21st-century workshops, which must be functional and ergonomic in all aspects.The head offices of my most successful investments included a metal shed on an industrial estate, a converted textile mill and a mezzanine floor in a warehouse. Hardly prestigious, but they did the job – and meant more cash could be ploughed into winning customers, launching products, hiring the best people and owning the finest machines. It’s all a question of priorities.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts"
496;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-10-19T14:41:52Z;PPR looks from LVMH to Nike, boosts the C-suite;;"PPR is putting luxury on hold and charging forward into sportswear and sustainability. Yesterday, the French conglomerate displayed its trademark dispassionate ability to end (or suspend) industrial dalliances it feels may become less than productive by announcing the creation of — and concentration on — a new “sport and lifestyle” division run by Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz, who has also been promoted to executive chairman of Puma.Last year PPR announced plans to divest themselves of their retail properties (FNAC, Conforma and Redcats), and general industry wisdom was they would use money from those sales to buy another big luxury name — Hermès, Armani, Bulgari and Tiffany have all been mooted as possible targets. Now, however, it seems the group has decided to spend the money on more mass brands, which may have less costly brand value (the equity associated with names like Hermes and Armani is enormous). Put another way, apparently they’ve moved their sights from LVMH to Nike.It’s an interesting change, but not unprecedented (PPR originally focused on the timber and building materials businesses, but segued to retail in the 1990s, and then luxury at the turn of the millennium). For the moment — until the sport war heats up — I’m more struck by the lead the group buried: the fact Mr Zeitz is becoming not only Puma’s executive chairman and head of the division, but also PPR’s chief sustainability officer. Google has one of these, as does Cisco Systems, but as far as I know, most luxury groups don’t – which either demonstrates the group’s move away from luxury, or a backroom strategy for remaining on top of one area of the glossy world. Who wants to bet on how long it takes LVMH to appoint a CSO of their own?In any case, the title joins the recently invented chief creative officer, as awarded to Burberry’s Christopher Bailey and Jimmy Choo’s Tamara Mellon, in padding out the 21st century C-suite. It also clearly indicates PPR’s belief that: 1) the ability of brands to incorporate green and ethical concerns into their basic structure will become increasingly important not only to mass and luxury consumers but also employees; and 2) a cross-group, organized strategy needs to be developed to do this efficiently and convincingly. I expect we’ll hear all about their new packaging soon."
497;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Puma chief to head new PPR division;;Jochen Zeitz, Puma’s chief executive, is to head a new “sports and lifestyle” division at parent company PPR, the French luxury goods and retail conglomerate, amid a shake-up of the German sporting goods group’s corporate governance.Mr Zeitz will also become executive chairman at Puma and oversee the search for a new chief executive for the company, which is to be at the centre of PPR’s plans to build a bigger portfolio of sports and leisure brands.Puma will be converted into a societas europaea, or SE, with a one-tier board that will include François-Henri Pinault, PPR’s chairman and chief executive, who is currently Puma’s supervisory board chairman.Since 2004 companies from European Union member states have been able to convert to SE status, a form of corporation that uses cross-border company laws.Puma said SE status would allow it to have a more flexible management structure than allowed by a dual tier of management and supervisory boards. It said employees would be represented on the new board. PPR owns 71 per cent of Puma, the world’s third-largest sports goods company, after Nike and local rival Adidas.Mr Pinault said on Monday the changes would strengthen the organisation of Puma’s management team and put Mr Zeitz in charge of creating a portfolio of sports brands. He said they were not designed to presage a complete buy-out of Puma’s minority shareholders.He said Mr Zeitz would pass on “day-to-day operational responsibility” to a chief executive at Puma once the changes were implemented, expected to follow a vote at Puma’s annual meeting next year.Mr Zeitz has headed Puma since 1993, when he was the youngest chief executive of a listed German company at the age of 30.His successor will inherit a five-year plan to increase Puma’s sales from an expected €2.5bn ($3.5bn) in 2010 to €4bn in 2015. Mr Zeitz and PPR are to disclose more details of the strategy next week along with Puma’s quarterly financial results.Mr Pinault said PPR was targeting “brands with global potential” but declined to discuss targets and said he did not intend to make significant acquisitions before completing the sale of at least one of the retail companies it has put up for disposal.PPR is selling companies including Fnac, the high street book and music retail chain, the Conforama furniture stores and Redcats, a catalogue group.It will concentrate on luxury goods, centred on its Gucci brand, as well as the sports and lifestyle division.There was some surprise among analysts at the timing of the announcement, ahead of next week’s presentation of Puma’s five-year plan. This led to speculation that there could be an imminent sale by PPR of one of its retail businesses, such as Conforama, which has attracted interest from private equity groups and Steinhoff, the South African furniture maker.Additional reporting by Scheherazade Daneshkhu in Paris
498;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-10-12T20:35:18Z;Nike strips NFL ball from Adidas;;The National Football League will drop Reebok as its official provider of licensed sportswear starting with the 2012 American football season in favour of Nike, bringing an end to a 10-year contract that was agreed before Reebok was acquired by Adidas of Germany in 2006.The shift is likely to cost Reebok about $350m of its $565m in US apparel revenues, according to Kate McShane, a Citigroup analyst.For Nike, which already generates $4.9bn in revenues from sales of sportswear, the importance of the NFL contract is as much bound up in its sponsorship opportunities as in the incremental sales that will be generated by the deal.In a statement, Charlie Denson, the head of the Nike brand, said: “With this relationship, Nike’s position in our largest market in the world will be stronger than ever.“We believe our agreement with the NFL enhances the Nike brand, and provides a significant opportunity to drive growth across the business – both in our performance products and sportswear.”The NFL, which draws massive television ratings in the US every weekend from September through to early February, culminating in the Super Bowl, is one of the most sought-after sports media properties in the world.The new contract – which will last five years instead of 10 – will result in Nike’s “swoosh” logo appearing on the uniform of every NFL player.Unlike the Reebok contract, which also provided for team caps and assorted headwear to carry the company’s logo, the new NFL contract grants headware rights to other vendors, New Era and ‘47 Brand.The NFL would not comment on the dollar value of the licensing contract, but the cost to Nike is believed to be less than the $1bn-plus that Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to pay for a six-year deal to be the league’s official beer sponsor starting next year.The new licensing contract takes place in the shadow of a recent Supreme Court decision overturning a lower court’s ruling that allowed the NFL to award licensing contracts that were binding on all 32 teams.In May, the Supreme Court reversed a decision against American Needle, a manufacturer of baseball caps that had complained that the NFL’s agreement with Reebok on behalf of all 32 teams violated anti-trust laws.As a result of the reversal, American Needle’s case was returned to district court, where the maker of caps will once again be able to argue that it should have the right to bargain with individual NFL teams for the right to manufacture headwear.

How did you get your current job?I didn’t get a job – I got a client and started a consultancy 23 years ago. My first client was Monty Don when he was in retail and I have never looked back.

Do you work in a specialist area?The consultancy specialises in consumer, retail, travel and leisure. Our clients include Sainsbury’s, Apple, Liberty, Nike, Virgin and Jamie Oliver Enterprises.
What is it about headhunting that appeals to you?I bring solutions to companies via the people that I bring in. I love what I do because it makes a difference to organisations, which is most satisfying.

How often do you “capture your prey”?To me, the process itself is as important as landing a candidate at the end of it – it’s about quality of delivery not quantity.

What was your best placement?My first plc board placement in 1993. I could not believe it when I got my first opportunity to work at board level. Liam Strong, the then chief executive at Sears plc, was an inspirational client who really changed the way we worked as a consultancy and gave me the opportunity to begin my career competing on an international, big playing field.

What is the most effective mode of communication?Even in this age of new media, speaking to people, preferably in person or on the telephone, remains the best and most effective method of communication.

How do you see the role of social media, such as LinkedIn?It’s just another tool – for us, personal communication and relationships are key to the process. A major part of this job is networking so that we can identify likely candidates through a combination of knowledge, recommendations and research.

How do you approach the big phone call?I have been working in this sector for 23 years so I know many of the people I am calling. And I only call people when I think I’ve got something they’ll want to know about.

Are executives in some sectors more receptive to calls than others?Retailers are very busy and are often not at their desks as they are in their stores. I don’t find it difficult to identify candidates as I have a natural curiosity and genuine interest in people. Because I have been doing this for such a long time, many people are recommended to call me – and others I have tracked for over 20 years. I often just meet people out of interest as you just never know.

What are the “tricks of the trade”?I never persuade reluctant movers – it has to be right on both sides or it will not work.

Your best piece of advice for anyone contacted by a headhunter?Always listen – you never know what opportunity might present itself – and what it might do for your career.

How can people best develop their relationships with headhunters?As Nanny McPhee says: “There is something you should understand about the way I work. When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go.” In other words, don’t just think about an immediate need. Headhunters can often help you. It is interesting that it is usually the most important and successful executives that talk to me for the very reason that they are often looking at where their next opportunity is going to come from."

Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery. Caterpillargained 4.6 per cent to $79.73 and Cummins added 2.9 per cent to $90.86.Housebuilders, which were yo-yoing all week in response to mixed data on the housing market, soared 3.1 per cent after new-home sales remained steady, at a low 288,000, in August. The financials sector, which has suffered after some analysts lowered their projections for quarterly bank profits, advanced 2.8 per cent, wiping out the week’s losses.Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $25.15, Goldman Sachs rose 1.6 per cent to $147.28 and Citigroup jumped 2.7 per cent to $3.90.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index added 2.6 per cent, lifted by news from Nike. The world’s largest manufacturer of athletics shoes beat expectations with its first-quarter profit and offered a positive outlook. Earnings per share were $1.14 compared with predictions of $1 per share after strong demand in China and the US.Sales soared 8 per cent and future orders jumped
13 per cent. Shares in Nike added 2.5 per cent to reach an all-time high of $79.57.But also in athletic apparel, retailer Finish Linefell 9.2 per cent to $14.25 after it missed estimates because it failed to restock popular items quickly enough.The technology sector, which has been the biggest riser so far in September, up 12.6 per cent, advanced 2 per cent. Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."
502;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-09-19T21:46:13Z;Bidders line up for AKQA;Private equity owner assesses several approaches;The private equity owner of AKQA is weighing up bids for the advertising agency, beginning a process which could see the last large independent digital specialist taken over by a strategic buyer.Several bidders have approached General Atlantic, which bought a majority stake in AKQA in 2007, according to people familiar with the discussions. Those people said that Morgan Stanley had been working with General Atlantic to handle the interest in the business. The process was at a very early stage, they said, but was being considered as a possible alternative to floating AKQA on the stock market in the next few years.AKQA employs around 800 staff. It was founded in London in 1995. Its clients include many of the world’s largest advertisers, including Nike, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Microsoft.AKQA, Morgan Stanley and General Atlantic declined to comment.Dentsu, the Japanese advertising group, is among the companies to have expressed interest in AKQA, after it missed out on acquiring two digital agencies, iCrossing and Razorfish, in the past two years. It did not respond to requests for comment.“There are multiple conversations happening at the moment,” said one person familiar with the discussions. “It’s not just one or two. There is a lot of inbound interest.”Digital assets are among the most sought-after properties in the media world, as traditional groups seek to acquire talent and technology in the fastest-growing part of the market.One person familiar with the process said Dentsu had offered more than $550m for AKQA, which equates to over three times its estimated revenues of around $165m this year.Sales have been growing at 25 to 30 per cent per annum, according to people close to AKQA, well above the industry average. Nonetheless, one executive at another agency said the reputed $550m price was “absurd”.Last year, Publicis acquired Razorfish from Microsoft for $530m, including a long-term media-buying commitment from the French group on Microsoft’s websites.Hearst Corporation, the newspaper and magazine publisher, acquired iCrossing, an agency specialising in search marketing, in June for around $325m.
503;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-09-13T09:17:24Z;Schools learn from the world of design;Schools are increasingly integrating design thinking into their MBA curricula;"In the late 1990s, the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, commissioned architect Frank Gehry to design a five-storey building to be the focal point of the school’s campus. Late in the design process, the size of the floor plan needed to be reduced.A Weatherhead faculty member flew to Mr Gehry’s studio in Santa Monica, California, to work out how best to trim the space with the team of architects. By the end of the third day, the plans were finished. But, as the meeting was about to adjourn, the project architect gathered the heavily marked plans and tore them into pieces. “We know we can do it,” he said. “Tomorrow, we can work on how we want to do it.”The Weatherhead professor was initially dumbfounded but the experience sparked an idea. “We learnt that designers dealing with messy problems across all kinds of domains have developed attitudes, ideas and techniques that are well suited to conditions that often face managers and organisation leaders today,” says Fred Collopy, professor of information systems at the school.In 2002, when the building opened, the school launched an initiative – “Manage by Designing” – that interlaces the disciplines of design throughout the curriculum and requires all students to take a year-long course in the subject. Today, Weatherhead is one of many business schools in the US and Europe trying to foster more creative thinking in MBA students by embracing some of the design industry’s teaching and working practices.The extent to which schools have integrated design thinking into their programmes varies. A handful of schools, such as Weatherhead and Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, have integrated the disciplines of design seamlessly into their curriculums, while others, such as Insead and Esade, have formed partnerships with art schools to create study exchange programmes and inter­disciplinary research opportunities. Others, such as Stanford, have taken a different tack. In 2005, the school established the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, which brings together about 350 students to work on innovative projects in the areas of law, business, education, medicine and engineering.No matter what the approach, the schools have a similar ambition: to encourage students to embrace inter-disciplinary teamwork, to hone their abductive reasoning skills and give them an appreciation for creative problem-solving and the role empathy plays in business.“There is something we [designers] contribute: a high tolerance for uncertainty, ways to grapple with visual representations and understanding problem-solving as an open-ended, playful process,” says Lucy Kimbell, a fellow in design leadership at Oxford’s Saïd Business School.The increased emphasis on innovation comes as companies are starting to view design as a strategic business issue. More Fortune 500 companies are raising the prominence of their internal product development teams as well as outsourcing some of their design needs to other companies. Organisations are also turning to designers to improve their services, operations and supply chains.At a time when opportunities in banking and finance have dried up, jobs in design and development are increasingly seen as a viable career path for newly minted MBAs.Design is no longer considered the “softer side of business”, says Pete Maulik, chief operating officer at Fahrenheit 212, a design company based in New York that has seen an 80 per cent rise in the number of MBA applicants from 2006. “It’s fundamental and drives top-line growth.”Insead has had a partnership with the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, since 2005. The collaboration involves an exchange of 10 students from the Art Center for the spring term of Insead’s MBA programme. Students take a course working in interdisciplinary teams to solve design-oriented problems.The goal, says Manuel Sosa, professor of technology and operations management, is to give students a taste of the tension that exists between a company’s management and creative department. Prof Sosa aims to give his MBA students an awareness of the value that designers contribute to an organisation.“Design is not just about making things look pretty,” he says. “It’s getting customers what they need.”Cultivating students’ abductive reasoning skills – which often involve creative leaps of imagination and visualisation – is another design discipline that business schools are beginning to embrace. Most schools view it as a complement to the traditional business curriculums, which put a premium on analytic and quantitative techniques, says Roger Martin, the dean of Rotman. “We want our students to use observation and intuition to imagine what could be, not just analyse things that are,” he says.Encouraging students to reframe questions and be more creative in their approach to problem-solving is another key attribute of the design process that schools are emulating. Often this involves using multiple models, says Prof Collopy.“The standard way we teach managers is to play their cards close to their chest until they really understand something. But industrial designers use multiple models to try ideas out rapidly and cheaply; they use many more back-of-the-envelope sketches and they fool around with numbers a lot more.”Some business schools are also striving to cultivate an empathetic view of the world among their students and equip these future managers with tools to better relate to their customers.“Designers have a deep understanding of the customer,” says Prof Martin. “Their goal is to delight the customer by giving them something they didn’t even know they wanted.”Prof Collopy adds: “Designers have empathy because they’re thinking about what will ultimately move their client. But managers often don’t have that. They think: ‘I don’t take a phenomenon seriously until it becomes statistically significant’.“By complementing the analytic with these generative skills, we bring the whole human being to the problems we face,” he says."
504;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-09-08T00:18:36Z;Luxury lodging makes a comeback;;Luxury lodging is back – but maybe not with all the frills hotel guests enjoyed pre-recession, says Frits van Paasschen, chief executive of Starwood Hotels.“It’s a nice try, but austerity is only cool for a while,” he says.The group behind Sheraton, Westin and St Regis and the boutique hotels W, Le Meridien and Aloft, was hit by the downturn harder than most rivals because of its concentration on top-end brands. But the 1,000-plus hotel operator now believes it has cause for optimism.In July, it beat expectations and recorded growth of 11.9 per cent in the industry benchmark of revenue per available room. Other lodging groups are also feeling more bullish.True, room rates were cut by on average 20-25 per cent during the downturn, and rates at Starwood started moving up only in the spring. Even then, the growth is more about a change in the mix of guests.But amid cautionary words on the recovery, Starwood declared in July “the Great Lodging Depression of 2008-2009 is behind us” and “The World Is Changing in Our Favour – We are Unequivocally Bullish on Long-term Prospects”.Mr van Paasschen doesn’t speak in initial capitals, but knows a thing or two about brands and how to sell them. Dutch-born but raised in Seattle, Mr van Paasschen, aged 49, worked at Disney before holding senior positions with Nike and becoming chief executive at Coors Brewing.“There is a parallel in some respects between what Nike did to the sneaker business and what W has done to the lodging business,” he says.“It brought lifestyle, it brought design, it brought personality, it brought attitude to a space that, once it was there it seems odd that it wouldn’t have always been there.” Mr van Paasschen has just returned from a European tour, opening a Brussels hotel for Aloft, the sister brand to W.Aloft, he says, is “the lodging industry’s answer to the Mini Cooper or Ikea or Top Shop, which is to say, style at a steal”.It is an interesting turn of phrase.In April 2009, Starwood launched a corporate espionage lawsuit against Hilton Hotels and two former executives responsible for Starwood’s luxury brands’ designs who had defected to Hilton.The case is ongoing – Hilton contests it – and Mr van Paasschen declines to discuss details, but he says Starwood is focused on ensuring that “the expertise that we’ve built up in a cumulative fashion is ours to bring to bear for our owners”.Starwood, he points out, is in some respects in the intellectual property business. It gives owners and developers a flag to put on their hotels and that creates value for them and for Starwood. “So we would guard our intellectual property in a significant way to ensure that we’re able to do that,” he says.Starwood was a pathfinder of branded boutique hotels (Mr van Paasschen prefers to call W, Aloft and Le Meridien “design-led contemporary brands”). Others treading down this path are InterContinental Hotels Group with its Indigo brand, Hyatt with Andaz and Marriott with Edition, in partnership with Ian Schrager, the godfather of boutique hotels.They must all chase W, which will have 50 hotels by 2011, and Starwood’s other luxury brands which, Mr van Paasschen says, have brushed aside the portents of the doom-mongers.“I was asked many times during the crisis whether I felt that luxury was dead and we maintained that once people felt more confident about their futures, once businesses felt better about their situation, that people would come back to luxury, and in fact at the beginning of this year we saw the greatest growth in luxury.“More has stayed the same than has changed,” he says.
505;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-09-06T19:53:42Z;England manager backs Rooney;;Wayne Rooney flew to Switzerland with the rest of the England football team, troubled by allegations about his private life that threaten his carefully constructed public image but determined to turn out for his country in Tuesday’s European Championship qualifier.The 24-year-old Manchester United striker, England’s most prized merchandise and the team’s only player with a world-class reputation, was confronted with Sunday newspaper claims he had cheated on his wife, Coleen, with a prostitute.Rooney, seeking to recover his footballing reputation after a dismal World Cup, was “ready to play”, said Fabio Capello, the England coach, at a press conference in Basel.“He wants to play and I’m sure he will play tomorrow very well. We are here to play, not to focus on the private lives of players.”Publication of the personal goings-on of England footballers have become wearily familiar. The Football Association, struggling to find new sponsors after the World Cup, must now seek replacements with its biggest box-office asset tarnished, said Tim Crow of Synergy, the sponsorship consultancy.“The FA will have their heads in their hands now,” he said.But Rooney’s alleged indiscretions could be especially damaging financially for one of the highest earners in football. They come less than a year after Tiger Woods lost a string of endorsements following ­revelations of the golfer’s private life.As well as a weekly wage said to be in the region of £100,000 and £760,000 of image rights earned in twice-yearly payments, Rooney has sponsorship deals with Coca-Cola, Nike and EA Sports. He also has a lucrative five-book deal with publishers Harper­Collins.He would have more sponsorship deals, but at a court hearing earlier this year his agent revealed that the number allowed by Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United manager, was restricted to five.Rooney shared top-billing in Nike’s three-minute World Cup television advertisement. Responding to the revelations, the sportswear manufacturer said it was a private matter, as did Coca-Cola.Nigel Currie, of sports marketing company Brand Rapport, said while sponsors were likely to stick with Rooney, the player and his wife had built a public profile as a couple along the lines of Victoria and David Beckham. That was now at risk.“They were the new kids on the block. As a joint brand they were absolutely massive,” said Mr Currie. “It was a potentially huge partnership and that is where the loss will be.”Rooney, something of a tearaway as a youngster, had worked on curbing his explosive reputation. He was a member of the welcoming party when a Fifa delegation was in Manchester last month as part of the governing body’s inspection of England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup.“Whereas Beckham is a national treasure, Rooney is the embodiment of England,” said one senior sponsorship expert. “He had the potential to be England captain and Manchester United captain. That has receded. It’s start-again time.”
506;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-31T20:55:42Z;An ambitious experimenter;;"If there is one phrase that encapsulates the Hiroshi Mikitani approach to running a business, it would be along the lines of the famous Nike slogan to “Just do it”.Asked about a string of bold overseas acquisitions launched in the past year by Rakuten, the online shopping mall he founded and heads, the 45-year-old says simply: “If we don’t take drastic action [the globalisation of Rakuten] is going to take forever. Either you do it, or you don’t do it,” he says, speaking in a spartan room in his office in central Tokyo.That combination of ambition and can-do attitude runs through the history of Rakuten. Over the past 13 years, Mr Mikitani has built it up from a six-strong operation into the country’s most widely recognised internet brand, with more than 35,000 merchants offering goods and services, and gross transaction volume of Y1,800bn ($21.4bn, €16.8bn, £13.8bn).Now Mr Mikitani has his sights on the global market. Before long, he wants to see the group operating in 27 countries and generating global transaction volume of Y20,000bn.As a first step, Rakuten recently acquired PriceMinister, France’s biggest online marketplace operator, following its acquisition of Buy.com in the US.Although Rakuten is almost un­known outside Japan, Mr Mikitani’s ambitions include surpassing its bigger overseas rivals such as Google, Amazon and Ebay. “I am confident that our business model is going to work in other countries,” he says. “Our ultimate goal is to become the number-one internet service company in the world.”That self-assurance and willingness to set ambitious goals has been crucial to Mr Mikitani’s success.Dismissing the conventional wisdom that Japan is not conducive to new ventures, he says: “I don’t think starting a business in Japan is hard.”He does, however, admit that “you need guts”. Indeed, Mr Mikitani must have had “guts” when he decided to leave a prestigious, secure job at the Industrial Bank of Japan to strike out on his own.Setting up an online shopping mall may have been timely in 1996, amid mounting excitement over the possibilities of the internet. But it was also fraught with difficulties. Much bigger companies with great­er brand recognition and deeper pockets were already offering online shopping and failing miserably.Moreover, the idea of selling goods on the internet was utterly alien to the kind of small merchants Rakuten wanted to sign up for its online mall. In the first few weeks of talking to potential vendors, Mr Mikitani and his five staff persuaded only five to sign up.Undeterred, however, they persevered, with optimism, Y20m in capital and plenty of ingenuity.Lacking the software tools Rakuten needed, Mr Mikitani enlisted Shinnosuke Honjo, his business partner when the company was founded, who was a novice in such matters, to develop them. He believed Rakuten’s eventual success would depend on setting tough goals and on people’s ability to achieve them through constant improvement.In Mr Mikitani’s book Principles for Success, published three years ago, he wrote: “At least in the business world, breakthroughs are only born when you achieve goals that seem unachievable. There is not much point in setting goals that are clearly achievable.”But it is equally clear that Raku­ten’s success rests on much more than mere ambition, guts and determination. Every big decision and initiative taken at Rakuten has been based on detailed strategic analysis and thorough reasoning – whether by the top management or by Mr Mikitani himself.In the early days, as a result of an analysis of the vendors Rakuten sought to woo, Mr Mikitani and his employees would walk at speed around the neighbourhood – or even do push-ups – before approaching the potentially sceptical small-business owner. The idea was that the business owners would be more likely to trust someone looking a little sweaty from hard work and who looked like he was trying really hard to win business than a slick salesman in a fine suit.As a result of analysing the failure of earlier online shopping malls, Mr Mikitani adopted a business model based on direct communication bet­ween seller and customer. Because of this, Rakuten is purely a mall – where vendors bring their wares and where customers find them – and does not take on inventory of its own.The direct interaction between on­line vendor and buyer means that “it’s more alive than the very serene marketplace of our competitors”, he says. “We have a more human touch. The reason why we created this company is to empower small and medium-sized businesses through the internet.”Rakuten’s online mall enables even the smallest vendors in the most remote regions to reach millions of potential customers; some, says Mr Mikitani, have transformed themselves from ailing operations into ones generating more than Y100m of sales a month.Rakuten has had its share of luck, too. Mr Mikitani started the company with his own funds, earned at IBJ and then through his private consulting business. But it was fortunate that he raised Y50bn in an initial public offering just before the dotcom bubble burst. Rakuten listed on Jasdaq, the market for start-ups, in 2000 and has since raised about Y230bn in four equity offerings.But listing has not changed the way the group is run by Mr Mikitani, who, together with family members, controls about 44 per cent of the shares and is still very much the dominant force.He has also brought in experienced outsiders, such as Kazunori Takada, chief operating officer, and Kentaro Hyakuno, head of global business – both from Toyota.Yet even as Rakuten has developed into a broad-based group that encompasses consumer credit and travel agency services, as well as online securities brokerage and banking, Mr Mikitani has continued to innovate and challenge the status quo.In 2004, when Japanese baseball was threatened by poor finances, Mr Mikitani started Japan’s first new baseball team in 50 years and ensured it made a profit in its first year. And in 2005, Mr Mikitani shocked the business community with an ultimately unsuccessful hostile bid for one of the country’s biggest national broadcasters, TBS, which he wanted to merge with Rakuten.He also guards against the danger of becoming hidebound by travelling overseas at least once a month, even if it involves a two-day round trip between Tokyo and Barcelona.Mr Mikitani heads JeBA, an association aimed at strengthening Japan’s competitiveness through the expansion of the internet and e-business. By taking Rakuten overseas and pledging to make it the world’s leading internet services group, Mr Mikitani is staying true to his own dictum that leaders must set high goals.Not only is going global a challenge for Rakuten, he says, but it is also a way for him to “pave the way for younger people” in Japan. After two decades of economic stagnation, they “are becoming very, very conservative, which is bad.“Obviously, I am doing this for my company …But at the same time, this is an extremely important experiment for Japan.”"
507;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-27T23:23:35Z;Is this the best polo shirt in the world?;;The Nike design team claims to have created “the perfect polo shirt”. Called the “Grand Slam” (prices from £35), it is made from piqué fabric to breathe better, with a flat-knit interior fabric to enhance smoothness, and precisely sized buttons that ease fluidly into the holes. Heck, even the trademark “tick” insignia is souped-up. But does it hold up to scrutiny? Five men put Nike’s promise to the test.On the polo pitchGuy Verdon of Lynt polo club, GloucestershireMy fellow polo players did laugh at me a little because my shirt was pink, but apart from that they thought it was quite cool. What they didn’t realise however, was that the shirt was by Nike. I played for an hour and I didn’t get as hot in it as I would in a normal polo shirt. The shirt was also stretchy and allowed me to move. Yes, the Nike version may be expensive in comparison to Fruit of the Loom polo shirts, but it is cheaper than a bespoke match shirt, which can cost £80. I’d never worn a shirt like this before, but I was quite impressed.In a magazine officeMorgan Rees, editor of Men’s HealthIn most offices, men’s summer dressing comes in but two portion sizes: too much effort and not enough. We either gamely swelter through the heat in suits bought in February, or, in offices with a more liberal dress code, become determined to test the limits of sartorial tolerance through Havaianas and cargo shorts (call me old-fashioned, but no one with management responsibilities should ever wear shorts – you can’t tell someone off if they can see your knees).Publishing tends toward the latter, although there are limits. Fortunately the Men’s Health crew are a style-savvy bunch who police themselves. At any one time, about half the office are involved in some fitness challenge or other so the smart-casual feel of the new Nike polo shirt was a welcome one. The fitted cut keeps it just the right side of smart – it looks at home under a lightweight blazer. Best of all, its discreet circular logo means it’s not easily mistaken for sportswear. The last quarter of this year beckons with its meetings, presentations and opportunities for dressing up. But right now the thing is to look comfortable. Try it, its versatility is infectious.At an investment bankJohn Davies, MD at a boutique investment bank in New YorkI’ve noticed many of the traders at our bank wear polo shirts to work – they’re an acceptable compromise, post-dress-down Fridays, between a collared shirt and a T-shirt. When I put my Grand Slam shirt on, although it was tight around the biceps, I liked the fit. The cotton also breathed well, so I went to work with reasonable confidence. It didn’t last long. One colleague liked the texture of the shirt (“it kind of drapes”), but was confused by the logo (“new Nike?”). Someone else was concerned that it might need special care (it doesn’t, apparently). In the end, although one peer did note it was an improvement on the shirts I normally wear, I had to conclude that while the Grand Slam might be perfect for the weekend, it clearly was not perfect for the workplace.On the tennis courtPeter AspdenMy earliest memory of watching tennis was during the era of the incomparable Rod Laver. They were different times: rackets were made of wood, backhands were one-handed, and no player would countenance wearing anything other than a crisp, white, cotton polo shirt. So to hear that Nike, the world’s mightiest sports manufacturer, had produced what it describes as the “ultimate” polo shirt put me in a retro reverie. I hatched a plan: I would turn up to my local club, slip the shirt on, and out-psych my opponent on sartorial grounds alone. It was, as advertised, well-cut and felt heavenly to put on, compared to the shiny, man-made garments that threaten to start a fire every time you pull one over your head. The logo was too clever by half, however: the circle of swooshes makes the shirt look like a commemorative prize from a Rotary club dinner. Nike cannot, in any case, compete with the heritage of brands such as Lacoste and Fred Perry. My opponent said my outfit looked “nice” but did not appear to be suffering any obvious psychic distress. We began to play. It was a close, sultry evening, and I began to sweat. And suddenly I was made aware of why cotton shirts went the way of wooden rackets and one-handed backhands. They get wetter and wetter, and heavier and heavier, then cold and slimy, and before you know it, your game has fallen apart and a couple of sets have slipped away from you. True, it never seemed to bother Rod Laver. But my advice is: stick to the weird polyester fibres, for match play at least. Cotton is for posers, and the giants of the past.At a wine-tasting partyNeil O’SullivanOne of the least-known but most definitive ways of assessing the claims of any polo shirt is to wear it to a wine-tasting event in the neighbouring village. Of course it is going to cut it on the tennis court or at the office but can it withstand scrutiny from a crowd that knows quality leisure wear inside out, and probably contains at least one person who belongs to a golf club?I am quietly impressed then, when shortly after my wife and I arrive, one of the women in our party nods at my slim-fitting navy blue cotton Grand Slam and says: “Nice shirt, Neil”.This type of unsolicited compliment doesn’t happen as often as it should to me but I try to pretend it does, nod acknowledgement and say “Thanks”.Manfully, I suppress the urge to explain that it’s meant to be “the best polo shirt in the world” until at least two glasses of wine later, when someone else says the colour is good and, before I know it, I have volunteered everything I know about the shirt.After that, it is really put through its paces. I have to stand up to show off the cut, and explain the cunningly disguised Nike logo (“Oh!”) at the same time as hold my stomach in (the fit is excellent but you can’t relax too much). To the Grand Slam’s impressive list of boasts can be added: good for keeping the conversation going.Back home, my wife says the shirt looked good. I say that it was amazing that one woman complimented it straightaway without knowing it was meant to be the best polo shirt in the world. “Don’t be silly,” she says, “I tipped her off when we got there.”
508;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-26T17:34:32Z;Asian rival makes big strides on Adidas turf;;"“Foreign monks give better sermons”. This traditional Chinese saying, from the mouth of a shopper in an Adidas store in Shanghai this week, captures the simple proposition on which global brands have traded profitably in China for decades: “foreign” is almost always assumed to mean “better”.When it comes to sports shoes, that has long meant Adidas is automatically assumed to be better than Li Ning, the domestic sportswear brand named after the Olympic gymnast who lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.But now Li Ning has pulled neck and neck with Adidas as the number two sports brand after Nike in China, a move which could mark a seminal moment in the history of Chinese innovation, and a sign that China can rebrand itself as not just cheap, but cool.But it is uncertain whether Chinese companies are ready to compete head-to-head on branding, marketing, innovation, design and quality with some of the strongest brands on earth.In China, only a rare domestic company can claim to do so: Lenovo in computers; Haier in white goods; and Huawei in telecommunications equipment, perhaps. Chinese sportswear brands such as Li Ning, and downmarket Anta – which in five years grew from almost nothing to nearly Rmb6bn ($882m) in 2009 sales – have made great strides to build their brands in recent years, retail analysts say.“A lot of westerners say Chinese can not brand and can not market. That’s not true,” says Shaun Rein of China Market Research in Shanghai. Li Ning has outpaced Adidas in some Chinese markets “because they are at a better price point but they are still an aspiration buy,” he says.Until now, the battle has not pitted foreign brands directly against local ones, so much as top tier brands of whichever nationality “and smaller brands you have never heard of”, says Xiaopo Wei, sportswear analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong.“Li Ning and Anta are not competing directly with Adidas and Nike but the pie they are eating is growing larger and larger, while Adidas’ and Nike’s pie is not growing at the same rate,” says Tom Doctoroff, head of JWT in China, which counts Anta as a client. Anta and Li Ning are proportionately stronger in smaller Chinese cities, which are growing faster.But now both sides appear bent on more direct rivalry. Li Ning, which announced first-half earnings growth of 11 per cent this week, will go upmarket to a price range within 15-20 per cent of that of its foreign rivals. Meanwhile, Adidas plans to expand downmarket to much smaller Chinese cities.Christophe Bezu, greater China head of Adidas, told the Financial Times that his company would dramatically expand market share in third to sixth tier Chinese cities. Its current share in such cities is 5-8 per cent, with local brands holding 60-65 per cent.Adidas also plans to develop products for the “affluent poor” in those markets, starting at Rmb350-400 for a sneaker. Nike and Adidas shoes typically cost Rmb500-Rmb700 in larger cities.Nike, too, has said it plans to expand in smaller cities, and will announce a new pricing strategy soon.Adidas says its recent slippage in market share is only temporary – the company overstocked for an Olympics sales spike that never happened and Chinese companies were more circumspect.“It certainly was a tough wake-up call for Adidas after the Olympics,” says Mr Bezu. “But we are coming back fast and taking market share,” he says.International brands evidently will not give up without a fight.Li Ning may temporarily pip Adidas at the post, but most analysts think the company has a long way to go to make that lead permanent. “The moment that a local brand can command the same price as a multinational brand is the day that a breakthrough has been made,” says Mr Doctoroff. That day is closer than ever before – but it has not come just yet.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen"
509;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
510;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-24T19:15:30Z;Puma extends sponsorship deal with Bolt;;Usain Bolt, the Olympic sprinter and world record holder, is renewing his sponsorship deal with Puma, extending his contract with the German sports wear company until beyond the London Olympics.Puma said the deal placed the Jamaican in the top bracket of global sports stars and was “by far the largest ever” for a track and field athlete, but declined to give details of the terms.Mr Bolt is thought to have earnings of about $1.5m a year from Puma, but industry experts believe this new deal will take him into a much higher bracket, on a par with the likes of Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who is sponsored by Nike.Mr Bolt, 6ft 5ins tall, gets a share of sales from Puma’s Bolt Collection apparel, which was launched last year and, in line with his previous deal, an element of his earnings from Puma is related to his performance.Winner of the 100m and 200m at the Beijing Olympics and world record holder in both events, Mr Bolt is signed up with Puma until the end of 2013, covering two world championships and also one Olympics.Puma will make him the focus of its global marketing campaigns and continue to develop product ranges.Mr Bolt’s victory celebrations at Beijing and his carefree demeanour have established the sprinter as one of sport’s most charismatic and followed individuals.“My contract is looking pretty nice.“This is what you work for, this is my job. I go there and work hard to make a good living, and it’s paying off,” he told the Financial Times on Tuesday.While acknowledging that athletics attracts less money than other sports, Mr Bolt said the climate was changing.“There are more sponsors coming in, little by little, and people are starting to earn their money in track and field.“I’m enjoying what I can get, and I’m working to earn as much money as I can before I retire.” Puma prides itself on having discovered Mr Bolt as a 16-year-old in 2003 and on its close links with the Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association.Mr Bolt repaid that in Beijing when he won the 100m, he took off his Puma running shoe and showed it off to the TV cameras.Jochen Zeitz, Puma’s chairman and chief executive, declined to say how much Mr Bolt was worth to Puma but he drew attention to media estimates that put it at hundreds of millions of dollars.“He is one of the very few truly global icons in sport,” said Mr Zeitz.Asked about the value of the deal, Mr Zeitz said: “I know pretty much what’s being paid for sports stars. Given his tremendous performance in the last few years, there was a significant increase in the contract.”
511;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-24T19:04:47Z;Investors take indirect route into China;The investment community looks for fresh angles for exposure;"With a stimulus-fuelled boom in domestic demand altering the composition of China’s breakneck growth, investors are increasingly looking at fresh angles to buy the dragon.Gaining exposure to China’s growth story can be a tricky prospect – China’s currency is still largely controlled by the state, its bond market is small and suffers from a weak legal structure, and Chinese equities have been a poor indicator of the country’s economic success.The Shanghai Composite index remains the second-worst performing major equity market in the world this year, after Greece, despite gross domestic product growth steaming ahead at 11.3 per cent in the first half of 2010.So it comes as little surprise that the investment community is looking at alternatives to gain China exposure from resources and currencies to debt and non-Chinese equities.A long-time China play has been through commodities and within the commodity basket, copper has been the traditional choice.The red metal is important both for infrastructure development and improving energy efficiency. In recent years it has been a decent proxy for Chinese industrial output, and that looks set to continue.In 2000, China bought 12 per cent of the world’s copper. In 2009 that had risen to 40 per cent, according to research from Macquarie. Similarly, lead is a substance in short supply but in high demand in China, says Kevin Norrish at BarCap. China now buys 43.5 per cent of the world’s supply, and recent efforts to reduce pollution in major cities have forced a number of smelters to close, helping to put pressure on domestic supply.China’s booming market for cars and electric bikes should guarantee strong demand, the key question is how much lead China can supply without the need for major imports.Morgan Stanley’s China commodity pick is coal – China’s growing demand has seen it turn net importer in recent years, while neighbouring producer countries, such as Mongolia, are looking into new projects to exploit that rising trend.In the agricultural sector BarCap favours corn. While China’s rising incomes haven’t seen its population significantly turn to coffee or chocolate – it has seen a rising appetite for meat. As corn is used both for human consumption and animal feed, it is a good proxy for changing dietary habits.“China has for many years been a net exporter of corn, but it is now starting to flip between imports and exports. We believe these are the first steps on a journey that will eventually see China shift to being an importer of corn on a structural basis,” Mr Norrish says.For China followers, commodities have a strong appeal as veteran investor Jim Rogers explains: “[They] are the best way to gain Chinese exposure, because one does not need to worry about central banks, corporate governance, financial statements, etc, and China must buy most commodities.”By contrast, corporate debt in China can pose major challenges for investors with recovery rates following default almost impossible to gauge.“When it comes to creditors’ rights for corporate bonds, China ranks the lowest in Asia,” says Esther Chan, debt portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. “The bankruptcy process for creditors is unproven, and past experience doesn’t give investors much comfort. Countries like Indonesia who have been through prior crises are more creditor-friendly”.Meanwhile, the few, well-established Chinese companies that issue debt are starting to look expensive, say analysts. Parkson, the department store chain, has seen yields drop from over 7 per cent to about 4.5 per cent. And less direct plays, such as bonds issued by Brazilian steelmakers, are starting to lose their China bias as the Brazil’s domestic growth story takes off.Instead, Ms Chan now looks for China exposure through bonds of property companies.“If you are willing to weather the volatility from policymakers’ attempts to slow real estate growth, keep a longer-term horizon and invest only in the top quality issuers of the Chinese real estate sector; the risk return profile of Chinese property bonds is very attractive and provides exposure to the growing wealth of the middle class in China,” Ms Chan says.In the currency markets, the Aussie dollar remains the most favoured China play (see chart). It is well plugged in to the development of China’s domestic economy – Australia provides the raw materials needed for construction and infrastructure, rather than the components used for exports, like nearby South Korea and Taiwan.For equity investors there are still some ways of buying into domestic growth, even in western markets, but investors are looking at individual companies.Recent research from Jonathan Garner of Morgan Stanley into macro-economic shifts in China points to a number of big multinational stocks that look set to benefit from rising wages and changing spending patterns in China.Those are mainly globally established brands, such as Nike, Yum! Brands, Unilever, H&M and L’Oréal, that target middle-income consumers. The potential for these companies is unprecedented – Mr Garner projects that by 2020, there will be more households with a disposable income of over $10,000 in Bric countries than in the US and the eurozone combined, with most of that growth coming from China.The message from the investment community seems to be that, while direct exposure to Chinese growth through the stock market remains tricky, there are still plenty of ways to buy the dragon.This is the fifth article in a series."
512;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-13T22:28:16Z;Will we see Woods for the bunkers and trees;;"Tiger Woods has not fallen all the way to the bottom, yet. The Nike logo is still on his golf shirt and two other corporate symbols on his cap. He has not yet been reduced to advertising Billy Bob’s BBQ on his gear.But last weekend everything else suggested the world’s greatest golfer was in disguise, down to the new goatee, at the Bridgestone tournament in Ohio, on a course he had won seven of the 10 times he entered. And no wonder; he finished last but one in the field, 30 strokes behind the winner.Golf is, above all, a game played inside the head. Even hackers like me know that on days when the biorhythms are right and the stars in alignment it seems almost easy. But there will be others when it is the hardest sporting endeavour on earth. Woods is lost in that awful alternate universe, contemplating the previously unthinkable that, not qualifying on his record, he might have to accept the captain’s discretionary selection to make the US team for the Ryder Cup to be played in Wales in October. (He said this week he would.)Clean-shaven again, a first round one under par, three early birdies but an indifferent middle passage, suggested better things at this weekend’s final major, the PGA championship. But if he does not follow through at Whistling Straights in Wisconsin, a fiendish course, all the talk will be of the greatest collapse in sporting history not brought about by age or injury. Bill Nack, who covered just about every sport for 30 years at Sports Illustrated, could only compare it with how Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran quit in the “no mas” re-match against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980: “He was never the same again.”The world knows why Woods is not the same – the serial affairs with bar girls and porn queens, bitter and expensive divorce proceedings from his wife Elin, the uncertain custody of their two young children, all tabloid fodder for nine months now, and forcing him to take a six-month break from competition.But the thought persisted that his steely determination and concentration – this was the man who won the US Open two years ago playing on one leg – would enable him to block it all out when he returned to the course. While he never threatened to win, fourth place finishes at the Masters and the US Open hinted he could do it. But it has been all bunkers and trees since.His playing peers all agree it is not a technical problem. His swing may be off, and he may have fired his swing coach, but no fatal flaw has been detected – unlike cricket’s Graeme Hick, the ultimate “flat track bully” who tore up the
English league but whose inability to play the short rising ball was exposed at international level, or baseball hitters beyond number who cannot hit the curve or lay off the high fast one.Sightings and reports of his private practice rounds at home are of big, straight drives and unerring putting, but when the tournament bell rings and the masses are there, all goes crooked. Even his once infallible putts are off line.Woods admits he is, or was, a control freak. Schooled by a domineering father and a tough Thai mother, he lived in a bubble from the age of two, but the bubble is burst, the father is dead and he has abandoned Buddhism. Ernie Els, the phlegmatic South African, has said he does not think he knows who he is any more, except that he has no sense of self-worth. (And if Nike does not think he is worth it any longer and drops him, then hello Billy Bob.)Mr Nack thinks he needs not a new swing coach but a “21st-century Freud” to restore some kind of “tranquillity”, which is another way of saying that the most electrifying player that the game, or perhaps any sport, has seen needs to become boring to win again. That is what most successful golfers are, but never, until now, the Tiger Woods who held the world in thrall.

Agency: Anomaly
Territory: Global
Verdict: ★★★★☆As sportswear labels try to market themselves as lifestyle brands, one well-trodden approach has been to enlist rock, pop and hip-hop artists as brand ambassadors in place of sports stars.Converse, which is owned by Nike, has been fortunate in that rock stars frequently wear its canvas trainers anyway. Arguably, then, all it needs to do is keep up with fresh talent.To that end, its “Three Artists, One Song” project brings together three musicians to create an original track and music video. Previous collaborators have included Julian Casablancas from The Strokes and Pharrell Williams.The latest track in the campaign – “All Summer” – features Vampire Weekend’s Rostam Batmanglij, the rapper Kid Cudi and Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino.In contrast to the bling-bling tone embraced by other sports brands, the “All Summer” video sticks these three musicians in a boho-style apartment and has them chuck breakfast cereal round while wearing outsized paper mock-ups of their own heads.The target market of cool indie kids will appreciate the song – throwaway but catchy – the setting, and the lack of a hard sell (there are no gratuitous shoe shots). Hats, or rather heads, off to all concerned."
514;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-08-04T22:23:21Z;Adidas rebounds after World Cup lifts sales;;Adidas has raised its profit forecasts for the second time this year after a successful football World Cup campaign bolstered a rebound in sales.The German company, which vies with US rival Nike for leadership of the sports goods market, announced the increase in expectations after confirming record first-half net income of €295m ($388m) compared with €13m in the same period last year.As a World Cup sponsor, Adidas provided referees and officials’ kit while also supplying 12 of the 32 teams including the winners, Spain, and Germany, which reached the semi-final. The shirts of Germany, Argentina and Mexico are among the company’s bestsellers. The best-performing team for Nike was Holland, which reached the final.While some of the star players sponsored by Adidas had poor tournaments, others including Spain’s Iker Casillas and Uruguay’s Diego Forlan won individual awards for their performances. Adidas also got plenty of exposure for its new Jabulani ball that was used in the tournament. The ball was criticised by a host of players for an alleged tendency to swerve unexpectedly.The interest in the World Cup is set to lift Adidas’s football-related sales to more than €1.5bn this year, surpassing the previous best of €1.3bn in 2008.Herbert Hainer, chief executive, said in a statement that the growth of Reebok in the US had also contributed to an “outstanding” six months. Reebok, which Adidas has struggled to turn round since it bought the brand in 2005, has shown signs of recovering thanks to shoe sales. Adidas said Reebok’s net sales in the second quarter rose 30 per cent in North America and 16 per cent overall.The company also said a “more favourable regional earnings mix” had contributed to a much lower tax rate for the period.Adidas, which gave key details of its quarterly results last month, said it was on track to report earnings per share of between €2.50 and €2.62 this year – equivalent to between approximately €520m and €550m of net income.At the start of the year it was much more cautious, saying earnings per share could be as low as €1.90. It raised estimates to between €2.05 and €2.30 in April.First half sales rose 7 per cent on a “currency neutral” basis to €5.6bn, growing everywhere except in China. The gross margin for the quarter increased by 4 percentage points to 48.9 per cent compared with last year, while the operating margin rose from 2.9 per cent to 6.7 per cent. Adidas said group sales on the same basis would increase at a “mid-single-digit rate” for the year.Adidas shares rose 0.5 per cent to €42.35.
515;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-07-22T18:30:50Z;US software group wins Premier League deal;;The Premier League made Electronic Arts, the games software provider, its official sports technology partner on Thursday, in the latest in a series of sponsorship deals with US groups.EA Sports, already the Premier League’s computer games licensee, will sponsor an enhanced player tracking performance index, giving fans data such as the distances players run, the speed of shots and the height they jump.The Premier League will install cameras at all stadiums to help gather the data, although it will take a season before the player tracking system is fully functional.EA Sports will receive on-screen branding rights when match statistics are shown, both in the UK and abroad.The deal extends the influence of US companies and individuals in football’s high-profile league. US interest in the Premier League has already led to deals with Nike, Budweiser and Wrigley’s, although the Budweiser deal has now lapsed.EA Sports, which has sold nearly 100m copies of its Fifa Soccer game worldwide, has also announced the renewal of its games licence for a further four years. The combined value of the deals is thought to be worth £10m-£15m to the Premier League.The extent of US involvement in the Premier League goes beyond sponsors, whose deals make up about 5 per cent of its £1bn annual turnover. ESPN, the US sports broadcaster, has a package of live Premier League matches and five clubs are owned or part-owned by US investors.Clubs have also made inroads into the US market. Manchester United’s kit and shirt sponsors are US companies and United and Tottenham Hotspur are on pre-season tours in the US.Tim Crow of sponsorship consultancy Synergy said: “The US is very much in the Premier League’s sights and has been for many of the clubs for a long time. United are getting hundreds of millions of dollars by their sponsorships. They’ve conquered it.”Football is less geared towards statistics than US sports such as American football and baseball, but Peter Moore, EA Sports president, said the increased use of data in the Premier League could help the sales of its football games in the US.“The US is a major market for us,” Mr Moore said. “Americans need to statistically analyse everything and this is where soccer befuddles many – it’s too fluid.”Richard Masters, the Premier League’s marketing director, said the greater use of technological data would help its growth in markets abroad.“We service 211 territories and we need to be presenting an enhanced product,” he said.“The broadcast enhancements through data and statistics will feed through in the next three years. The demand is coming from a number of different places.”He added that the sports technology sponsorship, its first new category since 2002, attracted “quite a lot of interest” from other technology companies.
516;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-07-04T22:31:35Z;England seek a substitute sponsor;;Marketing departments will have to weigh the benefits of being associated with the England football team now that Nationwide is set to end its sponsorship deal after 11 years.The country’s largest building society is unlikely to renew its £20m, four-year contract with the Football Association after the two parties were unable to agree a price.Nationwide said its decision had been taken before the World Cup started but its expected withdrawal will leave the national team looking for a new sponsor before the qualification rounds for Euro 2012 begin in September.The exclusive deal is regarded as one of the more high profile in British sport but not the most lucrative. By contrast Aon, the US insurance company, has just begun sponsorship of Manchester United that could be worth £100m over four years.While potential England sponsors would not be able to advertise on the national team shirt, they would get branding rights on all training kit, the team bus, media interview backdrop boards and ticket and broadcast sponsorship rights.However, analysts have suggested England’s poor performances and humiliating 4-1 defeat to Germany have shifted the market against the seller and in favour of the buyer.Nationwide had made a similar financial offer for the next four years before the World Cup. The FA has hired external consultants to find new backers, with reports suggesting it wanted £30m for the right to be official team sponsor, £10m more than Nationwide was prepared to offer.Sponsors always face a risk that goes with backing sports teams and individuals. Nike’s high-profile campaign for the World Cup suffered something of an own goal with its six most-marketed stars either failing to make the trip to South Africa or badly underperforming, while the French team’s implosion led to a backlash by sponsors.Other brands rumoured to be interested in sponsoring England include BlackBerry and Orange.Still it is not all doom and gloom for the FA. McDonald’s will sponsor the association until 2013, while Carlsberg and Nivea have also signed four-year deals this year.Nationwide, which has sponsored the Football League in the past, is expected to retain its deals with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football teams.
517;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-07-01T18:04:22Z;Sponsors get a kick out of the World Cup;;A new Coca-Cola sign hangs from the roof of Joe’s Butchery and restaurant in the poor black township of Alexandra, a few miles from the centre of Johannesburg. Inside, afternoon drinkers eat grilled beef and sausages and watch Paraguay take on Japan on a giant screen framed in the soft drinkmaker’s colours.“We are a Coke house,” jokes William Mathebula, a music promoter who runs the restaurant with his niece, Laly.As well as supplying the flat screen television, Coca-Cola has provided myriad decorations. All are branded in its colours, part of a World Cup-related initiative to extend sales of soft drinks in low-income areas. In total, 1,000 South African places like Joe’s Butchery have been kitted out as sites to allow customers to view World Cup games.And the scheme seems to be working, if sales at Joe’s Butchery are any guide. “Three years ago we used to sell three cases a week,” says Ms Mathebula. “Recently it has been up to 35 cases.”Coca Cola’s efforts in areas such as Alexandra are part of a much broader marketing drive linked to the World Cup. At its heart is a big sponsorship deal signed with FIFA.The soft drinks company is one of FIFA’s six “partners”, which have paid on average more than $100m (€88m, £73m) to sponsor the tournament.Each of the six (Visa, the payments company, Emirates, the airline, Hyundai, the Korean group that makes Kia cars, Adidas, the European sportswear company, and Sony, the electronics company, are the others) receive about nine minutes of advertising time per match. Eight other international sponsors pay about half that, receiving in exchange 4½ minutes per game, while eight so-called national supporters pay less for less coverage.Overall, the tournament, Africa’s first World Cup, attracted nearly $1bn in sponsorship.“This is of huge interest to a lot of brands,” says Nigel Currie, of the Brand Rapport sponsorship consultancy in London. “The consumer market in Africa is so big and so untapped. And these brands are all desperate to get a foothold.”The companies, unsurprisingly, insist that their outlays are cost-effective.Visa says spending by international visitors to South Africa on Visa branded payment cards was 65 per cent higher in the first 3½ weeks of June, compared with the same period of 2009. Over the same period visitor numbers rose about a fifth. Sponsors’ benefits have extended beyond South Africa, because of the billions watching on television.“It is clearly not just about the host market,” says Michael Lynch, head of global sponsorship management at Visa. “The television audiences for every single match but one has exceeded those of the last World Cup in Germany …we are seeing significant positive results.” Independent research appears to corroborate the sponsors’ view.Adidas has won back marketing ground from Nike, one of its main rivals since the World Cup began three weeks ago.NM Incite – a joint venture between Nielsen, the consumer research group, and McKinsey, the consultancy – found that its share of internet blogging and tweeting about the competition – so-called “buzz” – has risen, while Nike’s has fallen. Hyundai Kia, the Korean carmaker and another Fifa partner, has seen similar benefits.Emirates insisted this week that its sponsorship deal with Fifa had been “worth every cent”, allowing it to reach 2bn people. “To get the same kind of exposure online that we get from the World Cup sponsorship, for example, would cost about $3bn,” a company spokesman this week told Business Day, a Johannesburg daily.Not all the sponsors are as active in the local market as Coca Cola but back at Joe’s Butchery there is plenty of support for the idea that they should be.“Guys come here with their credit cards and their girlfriends,” says Mr Mathebula, who says living standards have improved radically in Alexandra in recent years. “The companies that don’t tap into this market are missing out.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London
518;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;The force is with Adidas;;Nike has lost its early lead in World Cup-related “buzz”, handing the marketing advantage back to official sponsor Adidas, a study has found.Figures from NM Incite – a joint venture between Nielsen, the consumer research group, and McKinsey, the consultancy – showed that Nike successfully “ambushed” its main rival in the run-up to the World Cup.Analysing online chatter about companies in relation to the competition, NM found that twice as many people were blogging and tweeting about Nike’s “Write the future” ad – which debuted on Facebook in May – than Adidas’ campaign, which included a TV spot inserting celebrities such as David Beckham and Snoop Dogg into a scene from Star Wars.But in the first two weeks of the World Cup, Adidas has reasserted itself. Its share of the buzz rose from 14.4 per cent to 25.1 per cent of related messages, while Nike’s dropped from 30.2 per cent to 19.4 per cent.The change comes in spite of Nike’s continuing investment in its ad, which has been frequently shown on TV around football games.Adidas has benefited from its heavy presence in and around the stadia of South Africa, Nielsen said, while Nike may have suffered from the poor performance of the sportsmen appearing it its epic three-minute spot. The scenario of Wayne Rooney growing a beard and living on a caravan site now seems more plausible than it did before the contest when it was jokingly depicted in Nike’s ad.“Half the game in buzz is fanning the flames,” said Pete Blackshaw, executive vice president of digital strategic services at Nielsen. “The Adidas Football Facebook page, for instance, is now up to over a million fans and they are dropping new content several times a day. The average post is generating upwards of 100 comments.”Other official sponsors, including McDonald’s and Hyundai, have also seen their profile rise since the tournament began. The six official Fifa partners now command 66 per cent of World Cup chatter, a “significant uplift” from 52 per cent previously, Nielsen said. Budweiser’s share of online buzz rose from 1.0 per cent to 4.9 per cent, it added.Drinks companies are doing particularly well out of their World Cup associations. According to figures from Experian Hitwise, Budweiser also dominated search-engine activity in the UK last week, seeing a 25 per cent increase in web searches. This week, Peroni, sponsor of the Italian team, and Carlsberg, the England sponsor, saw week-on-week rises in searches of 50 and 33 per cent respectively.

Viacom dropped 2.9 per cent to $37.94.Lennar, a leading homebuilder, declined 1.2 per cent to $14.57 as the company reported slightly better than expected second-quarter results. Revenues fell 8.7 per cent compared with a year earlier.Home deliveries and prices declined and new orders dropped as the government withdrew a tax credit for homebuyers at the end of April, causing demand to fall last month.US-listed shares in BP fell 3.1 per cent to $28.74 as the company resumed collecting oil from the Gulf spill, ending a temporary setback when a cap placed on the well was damaged.Cisco Systems, a maker of networking systems, fell 1.3 per cent to $22.57 after John Chambers, chief executive, announced a “firm commitment” to invest $1bn in Russia in five phases over the next decade.“Cisco feels the time is right to up the ante in Russia. The company has previously made big bets in China (approximately 15 years ago), India (approximately five years ago) and more recently Mexico that are paying off,” said Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.Apple was off 0.7 per cent to $269 on the day of the release of its latest iPhone model.The company is reported to have filed court documents complaining that HTC, the Taiwanese smartphone company, has violated four patents relating to phone software.Nike fell 4 per cent to $69.63 as the world’s largest maker of sports shoes reported fourth-quarter revenues of $5.08bn, short of the expected $5.15bn.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, slipped 5.6 per cent to $39.12 after it forecast second-quarter earnings of up to 63 cents per share. Analysts’ estimates were 64 cents.Other home furnishings retailers were also lower. Williams-Sonoma declined 3.1 per cent to $25.49, Kirklands fell 7 per cent to $17.54 and Pier 1 Imports dropped 7.7 per cent to $6.40.
520;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-21T21:49:32Z;Sponsors rethink their game plan amid French shenanigans;Mutiny on the pitch sparks questions about corporate image;Moveover BP, breathe a sigh of relief all you unloved bankers. The World Cup has just delivered up a whole new category of pariah and it is called the French national soccer team, known as Les Bleus.“To have the worst soccer team at the World Cup was already unbearable. To also have the stupidest is intolerable,” fulminated Le Parisien, the daily tabloid that gives voice to the ordinary citizen in regionalised editions throughout France.The decision by France’s players to boycott training this weekend after the French Football Federation expelled striker Nicolas Anelka for swearing at deeply unpopular coach Raymond Domenech has been greeted with fury back home.Politicians from Christine Lagarde, the finance minister, to Bernard Kouchner, foreign minister, have publicly reprimanded the players for a betrayal of the sport and, worse, the national image.Even President Nicolas Sarkozy is preparing to summon football federation officials when they return from South Africa for a dressing down over their failure to manage the situation.For several years now, after bad behaviour off the field and uninspiring performances on the pitch, the French have indulged in a love-hate relationship with their national team. It has been so ambivalent, that sponsors have sometimes been reluctant to put up the millions needed to ensure there is any team at all.Back in 2006, after the last World Cup, it was touch and go whether there would even be enough money to take the team to this year’s event, according to one insider. Luckily, the federation only recently completed new financing agreements that take it to 2014, which marketing agencies estimate give it almost three times the funds of the past four years.But after this weekend’s shenanigans, sponsors are clearly rethinking their commitments – if not for now, then perhaps for next time round.The mutiny on the pitch of Knysna has obviously sparked big questions about the risks of tying a corporate image to highly paid, highly volatile personalities.Quick, the French burger chain, was quick (pardon the pun) to withdraw the advertising campaign it has just launched with the offending striker, Mr Anelka.Crédit Agricole, one of the French team’s sponsors, has also withdrawn its ad campaign featuring national players, while others including Carrefour, SFR and GDF Suez have equally made their displeasure known. GDF Suez was reportedly examining its sponsorship contract “line by line”.And Nike, which is due to replace Adidas as sponsor of the kit in a deal worth more than €40m ($49m), must be wondering whether it backed the wrong team.About the only corporate winner in this unhappy affair may well be Carrefour. The hypermarket chain promised customers who bought its televisions that they would be reimbursed should the French national team scoop the Cup. That now seems virtually impossible.Winners and losers aside, there are clearly lessons to be drawn from the French affair – and they are not simply for the temperamental players or an inept football federation.Corporate sponsors too share some of the blame for standing back and allowing a clearly dysfunctional football federation to continue unchallenged. More than most, they are guilty of encouraging the star culture that has helped to boost their own profits but equally encouraged some players to put their own interests above those of the sport or its fans.Along with the millions that sponsors pump into the system every year – vital to supporting the sport at both professional and amateur level – they have a responsibility to ensure that the money is well invested. Surely that is what companies are supposed to do for a living. Why should it be any different on the field?State of payOn the subject of strikers, it might be worth sparing a thought for the French civil service, about to begin delicate pay talks with the government. Like the French players, civil servants have a tempestuous relationship with their fellow citizens. Everyone wants to be one, but those not in the club resent the perks.Now it seems that the government wants to step up spending cuts to get the public deficit back to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 2013. Officials confirmed on Monday that among the options being discussed were a cut in military spending, further cuts in the civil service, and even a pay freeze or nominal wage increase for state employees.Mr Sarkozy has taken on one taboo with a proposed pension reform last week. If he takes on public sector wages, he can claim to be playing the kind of aggressive game that often brings biggest rewards. As long as the players don’t walk off the pitch.european.view@ft.com
521;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-18T22:27:51Z;Venus Williams, fashion designer;;"Underwear and sport have a long and fruitful association: think David Beckham and those Armani briefs, or Didier Drogba and Cristiano Ronaldo in vacuum-packed Calvin Kleins on that Vanity Fair cover. Most recently, there is Venus Williams, five-time Wimbledon women’s singles champion and, as of last month’s French Open, controversial purveyor of the flesh-coloured hot pant.Whether or not she will dare repeat her fashion statement as the Wimbledon gates swing open on Monday is yet to be seen – “Wimbledon is strict,” she admits. But what has been revealed is that the creative responsible for her on-court wardrobe is, in fact, Venus Williams herself.In this she is but the most dedicated example of a current trend that has seen tennis seize the high ground back from fashion, which in recent years had been swinging its way handily on to centre court (Diane von Furstenberg, Ralph Lauren and Chanel have all created tennis lines). Now Maria Sharapova and Roger Federer have teamed up with Nike to produce eponymous sportswear collections, while Rafael Nadal is collaborating with watchmaker Richard Mille.Williams senior, however, has gone one step further, ignoring lucrative sponsorship deals to design her own independent women’s sportswear range. Called EleVen – “it’s about being your best, being better than 10. When you are being your best, you look your best, and when you look good you feel good” – she’s her own best spokesperson. The line was launched in 2007 but when its sole stockist, US sports retailer Steve & Barry’s, folded in 2008, Williams was forced to suspend production. She will relaunch the range at the US Open in August. Although she models the pieces on court, they will not be on sale until later this year.Williams insists that her mission is not about breaking sartorial boundaries. Instead, “I want to be me – unique – and represent myself in my game, in my attitude and in what I wear. It is all very appropriate; it all looks really good and colourful. Here is the brand, I am in control.” Thus, musing on the hot pant hoo-ha, she says, “At the Australian Open I wore a dress with the illusion of slits with nude shorts, and I thought ‘I want to do more with that illusion,’ so I wore lace with a whole new body suit attached to it [at the French Open]. It looks like it is skin underneath, so that way it is not taking away from the design.” As if oblivious to the media storm that ensued, she describes her own style as “definitely classic but fun, still reserved and still sexy”. Translation: canary yellow halter-neck at last year’s Australian Open; purple and blue psychedelic tie-die dress at last year’s Masters tournament in Rome; that lace dress at the French; and, she hints, a possible white lace dress at Wimbledon. All the designs boast the EleVen logo – a large V, not dissimilar to the garland logo on Fred Perry Tshirts. As for her equally fashion-loving sister: “Serena wears Nike [on court]. But perhaps, one day, EleVen will be able to afford her!”Although it took her eight years to complete, Williams holds a degree in clothing design from the Fort Lauderdale School of Fashion and Design. “I started school at 19 and finished at 27 – it was a little slower after the Majors,” she says. “You learn to make patterns, to sew, to thread industrial machines, about fabrics, textiles, you learn about the whole industry.” If she could collaborate with any fashion house, she says, it would be Louis Vuitton, and she cites Dolce & Gabbana as one of her style inspirations. Her favourite shop is Barneys Co-Op in the US, “because there are so many different designers from off the beaten path”, while her favourite shoe designers are Giuseppe Zanotti and Sergio Rossi: “Lately they have really picked up.” Williams’ motto – even on court – is “accessorise, accessorise, accessorise!” She is also a sucker for cosmetics: “I had a beauty product addiction,” she says.In other words, this is all about What Next. Williams acknowledges she is looking beyond the short shelf life of professional tennis. Alongside sportswoman and fashion designer, she also has her own interior design firm, V*Starr, and is launching a book, Come to Win, on “how sports can help you top your profession”, during the second week of Wimbledon.“I really don’t want to travel the world constantly and I would like to have something that I am interested in,” says Williams. “I have goals to design hotels and you know …slave away and obsess. Obviously, I am serious enough to go to design school and I want to continue what I love. I am absolutely crafting a post-tennis career.” It’s a career grand slam.www.elevenbyvenus.com‘Come to Win’ by Venus Williams is published by Amistad (£15.29/$25.99)Skin deep, a books essay on the philosophy of beautySimon Kuper: There’s more to life than tennis, says Serena Williams…………………….Full steam aheadI am sitting in Easton Regal hair salon in central London and I am steaming. Literally. My head is covered by an enormous plastic helmet-come-halo and a fine mist is rising from the contraption, writes Libby Richardson.This may not sound the usual way of achieving a picture-perfect mane of hair but that is what I am told will be mine after a Micro Mist, a Japanese invention which promises to use the power of steam to penetrate hair and lock in any treatment right down to the follicles. “We’re not fans of slapping on a treatment and calling it a service,” says my stylist Hannah. “We wanted to work with something we believed in.”Hannah believes in Micro Mist so much she slaps on a rather astonishing three different kinds of Kevin Murphy conditioner to treat my limp, lacklustre hair with dry ends. Then, after applying an intensive mask to my hair, I am manoeuvred into position under the plastic halo.I am left to steam there for eight minutes and, despite anxieties about the prospect of mascara dripping down my moist face, the warmth is strangely soothing. The treatment, which takes 45 minutes in all, finishes with a complimentary blow-dry.Outside the salon, I face my first challenge: a humid Tube ride followed by a blustery walk to the office. The former is likely to make my hair wilt; the latter to wreak havoc with the blow-dry. Thanks, however, to Hannah, and three weeks’ worth of conditioner, I arrive at work with defiantly voluminous, silky hair.

522;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-18T22:04:27Z;BP is the company we all love to hate;A slick of corporate hatred is spreading;"Last week I was making polite conversation with a neighbour when, apropos of nothing much, she said: “I really do hate BP.”This woman is British, middle aged, middle class and, as far as I know, has no firm views on anything apart, perhaps, from whether her son’s physics teacher is up to scratch. But she, like lots of perfectly normal people, seems to have got herself covered by the slick of corporate hatred that is spreading even further and more uncontrollably than the slick of oil. It’s not just Americans or lefties or environmentalists who now hate BP. Everyone else seems to as well.Compare this to how we responded to the biggest corporate catastrophe of all time, the gas leak at Bhopal in which thousands of people died. We were horrified. We wanted lessons to be learnt and compensation to be paid. But I don’t remember us all hating Union Carbide with quite the same vindictive intensity with which we now hate BP. If you type “I hate Union Carbide” into Google you get five matches. Do the same with BP and you get 37,400.You could say this was because Bhopal happened 25 years ago on the other side of the world and Union Carbide doesn’t sell products that slosh about in the tank of your car. But I think there’s something else going on too: hating companies and the people who lead them has become a new global pastime.When I was a teenager, hating companies was a much milder affair. This wasn’t because we felt more warmly towards business back then: on the contrary, in Britain the educated classes regarded all commerce with snobbish disdain. In particular, we despised advertising because we thought it was brainwashing. We also hated tobacco companies because their shareholders were making a killing selling things that killed their customers. We didn’t care for bankers because they were parasites and usurers. And we didn’t like oil companies because of the sneaky way that they always pushed up petrol prices when crude prices went up and then seemed to push them up again when crude prices went down.Beyond that, there were a few individual companies that we singled out for special hatred. We hated Barclays and Shell because they did business in apartheid South Africa. Later, we hated Nike and Gap for not doing the right thing by their sweatshop workers. But we didn’t hate them very hard or very consistently; it was a fragmented and feeble effort when set against the universal, concerted loathing that has been inspired by BP.Where does all this hatred come from? Business doesn’t seem to be much more hateful or management more incompetent than it was 20, 50 or 100 years ago. In fact, business mainly is more decent and managers less amateurish and hopeless than they used to be. Instead, I can think of four other things that have changed in the past few years that explain why nice women such as my neighbour are striking out on a crusade of anti-corporate hatred.The first is the emotional hangover of the credit crunch. Our hatred of bankers was wild and uncontrolled and we had never felt anything like it before towards men in suits. Dick Fuld and Fred Goodwin inspired hatred on a scale normally only achieved by an Idi Amin or Osama bin Laden. So much hating has got us into the hating habit.The second cause is executive pay. We already resent how much top people pay themselves, so when people who earn too much show that they are not only incompetent but also insensitive and tactless, our resentment spills over into hatred.The third reason is more subtle, and stems from the great personification of business. In the past decade or so, companies have put a great deal of effort into creating an image for themselves supported by a whole load of values. The more successful they are in creating such a personality, the more there is to love – and hate. The most successful companies in the US – Microsoft and Walmart – are loved and hated in equal measure.And finally, there is the internet, with its power to turn personal emotion into a global epidemic overnight. Hating companies is now fun, easy and varied. There are so many different ways of doing it. You can hate BP on Twitter, Facebook and, most rewardingly of all, on YouTube. If you haven’t already watched the BP Spills Coffee video, in which a group of executives panic when a Styrofoam cup is overturned during a meeting, do so right now. It will make you laugh – and make you hate BP a bit more than you did already.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
523;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-17T22:15:18Z;Coach lines up to kick World Cup ball;;According to Fabio Capello, the England manager, the ball being used at the World Cup is “the worst ball I have seen in my life”.The Italian, whose team exasperated fans with a typically unimpressive 1-1 draw against the US in Rustenburg last Saturday, explained to the BBC that it was difficult for players to direct long passes to their intended target.“But the really big problem is that sometimes this ball is impossible to control,” he said.Some seasoned England-watchers might view Mr Capello’s comment as the latest excuse in a long line coming from England managers to cover more obvious flaws in the national team.But Mr Capello is by no means the lone voice of criticism about the Adidas “Jabulani” ball (the Xhosa word means celebration).Players haven’t been shy in complaining about the ball. Goalkeepers were doing so before the tournament began, perhaps anticipating the number of howlers they would soon be committing.Adidas is understandably sensitive about the criticism. It hopes to sell 50m Jabulani balls, of various sizes, in the next four years, the same sales it achieved for the Teamgeist ball used in the 2006 World Cup in Germany.Shirts and boots are the staple football products for the German manufacturer, but the middle of a World Cup is hardly an ideal time for a sports goods company to be the subject of criticism.“We take the criticism seriously, we care about it,” says Günter Pfau, who heads up Adidas’s relations with Fifa, the world football body.World Cup organisers believe that blaming the balls is inappropriate. Danny Jordaan, chief executive of the local organising committee, said: ”The teams have trained with these balls long before they arrived here – this is how football works, you never blame yourself, you find something else to blame.”A speedier ball was the primary aim of the Adidas innovation team, and you achieve that, Mr Pfau said, by making it as perfectly rounded as possible. “The aim is to make it go faster. In Formula One, all the cars try to go faster,” he said.The technology behind the ball includes lots of fine detail, such as “thermally bonded 3D panels”. But the most important technical detail is the length of time the teams have had to practice with the Jabulani.Six German clubs have been using the ball in the Bundesliga since December (the entire league will adopt it from next season). It is no surprise that some football experts see a connection between this and Germany’s impressive opening game of the World Cup when they thrashed Australia 4-0 in Durban with a brilliant display.Mr Pfau is having none of it. Germany’s victory was all about the clever movement of players. “It’s the competitiveness of the team, it’s about how to learn where to run. It wasn’t about the ball,” he says.With a certain weariness, the Adidas executive points out that all 32 World Cup teams were “introduced” to the ball at a workshop in Soweto last December.Mr Capello’s comment may have more to do with the England team’s contract with Umbro, suggests Mr Pfau.There are stipulations agreed between ball manufacturers and the teams that endorse their product about when, if at all, they can use the balls of rival companies, which makes life difficult for players shifting around different competitions. The English Premier League uses a Nike ball, while the Adidas Finale ball is used in Uefa’s Champions League.As strikers continue to blast free-kicks high over the bar, midfielders misdirect their crosses and goalkeepers let weak shots through their fingers, they will continue to grouse about the tools of the trade.But history gives Mr Pfau confidence that the ball controversy will soon be kicked into touch.“I remember a lot of players after the 1986 tournament saying that ball was the best ever. But they had earlier complained about the ball,” says Mr Pfau. “It’s a mystery how the ball goes from being the worst to the best.”
524;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-11T16:52:25Z;World Cup advertising;Not all broadcasters will win from the huge sums being spent;"Advertisers are throwing money at the World Cup; the spectacle of Snoop Dogg wielding a lightsabre shows that much. But how much broadcasters will benefit is tied to how their home teams perform. France’s TF1 will charge €130,000 for a 30-second ad in the final, for example, but double that if the French team has made it that far. The best conceivable slot (just before Patrice Evra kisses the trophy) will sell for €351,000.Most television channels operate on a similar basis. But not all. According to ad agency Havas, British channel ITV will charge about £300,000 an ad for an England quarter-final but just £100,000 in an England semi or final. Why? Because the state-owned BBC would also show those matches and most viewers choose to avoid ads if they can, whether or not Nike persuaded Wayne Rooney to wear a silly beard."
525;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-10T22:35:33Z;Nike and Adidas tussle off the soccer pitch;;As the football World Cup gets under way in South Africa, the head-to-head rivalry between Nike and Adidas – the sport’s two largest brand names – is intensifying off the pitch.Charlie Denson, the head of the Nike brand, hit back at claims from Herbert Hainer, Adidas’ chief executive, that its German rival can still claim to be the biggest global brand in football.“I believe we already are number one” in sales, Mr Denson said in an interview with the Financial Times this week. “But our objective is to make sure that it’s not a debate.”Nike reported $1.7bn in sales of its core brand football boots, shirts and other equipment in 2008 – it is due to announce its 2009 numbers in three weeks’ time. Adidas reported football merchandise sales of €1.3bn ($1.6bn) – which would have been ahead of Nike at the then prevailing euro-dollar exchange rate.But Nike’s overall soccer sales also include revenues from the Umbro brand that it acquired in 2008, which totalled $276m at the time of the acquisition – giving the company an overall larger stake in the soccer business.On the pitch, however, Adidas will see more of its shirts in play during the tournament, having sponsored 12 of the 32 national teams taking part, including favourites Spain, as well as Germany, Argentina and South Africa. Nike has 10 of the teams, including Brazil, the Netherlands, the US and England (in Umbro kit), its largest representation ever.Adidas is also producing the ball that will be used throughout the tournament. But a major part of the battle will be fought out over the more profitable boots business – with Nike’s new premium Mercurial Superfly II up against Adidas’ F50i.“I believe we’ll have more boots on the pitch then any other brand,” says Mr Denson.Adidas’ Mr Hainer has also suggested that Adidas has the edge on Nike in its pre-World Cup marketing efforts. But Mr Denson says he “couldn’t be happier” over Nike’s pre-World Cup marketing, focused around a three minute video spot, “Write the Future”, featuring England’s Wayne Rooney and Portugal’s Ronaldo alongside other Nike-sponsored players and athletes.Initially launched online, and supported by a global banner block advertising blitz on Facebook and YouTube on May 22, which was the first of its kind, the video has been viewed more than 14m times on YouTube, and more than 29m times on all web platforms.Adidas is fighting back with a World Cup Star Wars parody video featuring David Beckham and a cast of celebrities, including Snoop Dogg and Noel Gallagher that has been viewed over 2.6m times since being unveiled last week.Nike, meanwhile, is encouraging viewers to insert their own football video moments into its “Write the Future” slot, to promote further viral transmission. Its Umbro brand has also launched a separate ad campaign, featuring photographs of seven players’ wives and girlfriends from World Cup winning countries.Both companies have an obvious interest in hoping one of their teams wins, which Mr Denson says can deliver “a great impact on the overall revenue potential that we would have”.He adds: “The last time Brazil won was eight years ago when our soccer effort was in its infancy. What would the impact be if Brazil wins today? I’m not sure, but it would be a lot bigger than it was eight years ago.”Nike has also identified further expansion of its football business as a key part of its broader objective of increasing its total sales by 40 per cent to $27bn from $19bn currently. It says that should include growth from its “affiliate” brands such as Umbro, Converse, and Hurley.
526;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-09T22:47:47Z;A sartorial strategy for growth;;"There is no question that football can sell fashion – Louis Vuitton’s current heritage campaign, featuring legends Zinedine Zidane, Pelé and Diego Maradona playing table football in a Madrid bar, was chosen, according to the company, specifically because of the “universality” of the sport’s appeal. But can fashion sell football?For the first time, Fifa, the sport’s governing body, is betting yes. This year it has licensed its imagery, including mascots and logos, to be transformed into a clothing brand, courtesy of Singapore-based Global Brands Group. In turn, the company, which also owns the rights to create and distribute products from the PGA golf tour, has licensed its products to 19 territories round the world – including the US, football’s most fan-challenged region. The theory is: if the sartorial strategy works there, it will work everywhere.Janon Costley, chief executive of Total Apparel Group (Tag), the company charged with making this happen in the US, believes that consumerism could be the answer. “During the period around every World Cup, Fifa has huge sales – during the last one they did $2bn in merchandise globally – which then dwindles to basically zero over the next three years,” he says. “It became clear to Fifa that they needed to come up with a new form of outreach to consumers. When Global Brands approached them with the idea of creating a clothing brand, they decided it could be the answer.”So, while Nike (sponsor of nine teams, including the US and Brazil) and Adidas (sponsor of 12 teams) project huge sales during South Africa’s event, Fifa is hoping that by entering the lifestyle market, it will not only keep interest alive between tournaments but may actually increase its audience in the US.This is especially important in the US, where, Don Jones, Tag’s chairman, points out, there is the most room for expansion.“The potential market is huge,” agrees Mike Principe, managing director of Blue Entertainment Sports Television (Best), an equity investor in Tag. He says there are now 18m registered football players in the US, a number that includes children playing in soccer leagues as well as adult weekend teams and official teams. Yet somehow all those players have never cohered into an identifiable and dedicated consumer fan base.Of course, there have been previous efforts to turn football into a mainstream sport in the world’s biggest market. The US hosted the World Cup in 1994 and, five years later, when the US football team beat China in the finals of the women’s World Cup, pundits predicted that this would provide the breakthrough.Even more famously, in 2007, David Beckham moved to Los Angeles to play for LA Galaxy and opened a football academy, saying “soccer is huge all around the world except in America, and that’s where I want to make a difference”. But earlier this year sponsor AEG closed Beckham’s California soccer academy.Why do the backers of the Fifa clothing brand think they can succeed where others have failed?Don Jones, Tag’s chairman, says the problem in the past was that the sport failed to cement its place in mainstream US culture. “Now, sport and fashion and entertainment are interchangeable, and you have to strategise with that in mind. Clothes put the sport squarely in front of people who might not see it any other way,” he says.Mr Costley adds that “if you buy the product, you participate in the sport in some way, so the garment itself becomes an educational platform”.The hypothesis works like this: a customer in search of a cool T-shirt sees one with, say, a cartoonish player on the front, or a faded, “aged” looking logo; he buys it and by wearing it, becomes both a walking advertisement for the sport and, perhaps, someone who starts kicking a ball around; he might then join a league, or at least turn on ESPN soccer, and football will then, like baseball or American football, become part of their identity.But despite Tag’s bullishness, not everyone is convinced. According to Robert Burke, founder of Robert Burke Associates, a strategic brand consultancy, a clothing brand is unlikely to achieve what a World Cup, celebrities and sport stars have not. “As with any licensing deal, the success is gauged by the size of the audience,” he says.“The Fifa brand could be interesting, with cool designs, but it would be very small compared to the American sports of football, basketball and [ice] hockey. With regards to the product helping influence the America interest in soccer, it is a long shot. The problem is that America. . . has not embraced soccer. I don’t think a fashion product will do the trick.”Andrew Sacks, head of Agency Sacks, a luxury branding firm, agrees. “It’s hard to believe that audiences – American or in football-loving nations – will respond to merchandise from a league,” he says. “Passions are aligned with teams, not with corporations and bureaucracies. The only exception that I can think of may be Nascar, which is a movement in itself and is made up of individuals. In team sports, the team sells.”Tag’s products have been specially selected to appeal to the US market – both men and women – with the company’s executives working with GBG’s design team in the Netherlands. Simon Hawkins, general manager of the Fifa Football Business Unit for GBG, says: “The collections have been engineered to garner an emotional connection with the consumer through the power and history of the Fifa brand.”To wit: for the first time, former World Cup mascots have been used on current products, with many chosen to appeal to the US demographic. For example, “Juanito” from the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, is featured to appeal to the large number of Mexican-Americans.There is also a separate “heritage” line that focuses on Fifa’s founding in 1904 on the Rue St Honoré in Paris, with the address embossed on the shirts not unlike the way Loewe, the Spanish luxury brand, has embossed its address on wallets, and Yves Saint Laurent has on clutches. “Before, football was seen as a European sport,” says Mr Costley. “And it was presented that way. We are trying to transform that perception.”Still, the history of such forays into the garment world is that they have not been enormously successful. As Jeff Bliss, a former marketer at New Balance, the running shoe brand, and co-founder of consultancy Brand Ideology, pointed out in Sports Business Journal: “Fan passion follows teams and players – they do not get excited about a governing body.”Yet Tag says that to worry about the meaning of Fifa is to miss the point, which is that whatever a consumer’s relationship with the governing body, the designs stand on their own. “Soccer isn’t just a game,” says Mr Principe. “It’s a fashion statement.” That’s the goal anyway.In Italy, Germany, France, Spain and England, brands and retailers such as Toshiba and Carrefour, are employing marketing strategies to give customers money back if their side does well, writes Stanley Pignal.Curry’s, the UK electronics chain, will for example refund £10 to recent buyers of high-end televisions for every goal that England scores, excluding own goals and penalty shoot-outs. “It essentially guarantees at least some sort of discount to anyone who buys a new TV from us, rather than a smaller chance of a bigger prize,” says Mark Webb of DSG, Curry’s parent company.Curry’s should be left with a manageable bill – about £60 if past England form in major tournaments holds. The company will not disclose what it expects its total liability might be, but is hedged through Lloyd’s of London, the insurer. Another company, Elgato, which sells portable tuners that enable computers to receive television signals, is offering a refund-for-victory scheme to customers in eight different European countries.The companies all say that one advantage of such schemes is that they can help nudge customers towards a slightly higher category of goods. They also typically ask clients to register with the retailer’s website, which can help build a relationship online. And it is less expensive than a conventional advertising campaign. The downside is that regulation can be complex and companies are not accustomed to handling such unexpected potential liabilities. Andrew Buchanan, head of IFRS accounting at BDO, says that the event could wreak minor havoc on some balance sheets. “If England are still in the tournament at the end of June . . . I would expect these retailers to record a liability in their second-quarter accounts, even if they are hedged against a potential pay-out.” "
527;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-09T12:03:26Z;The China price;Wage hikes pose little immediate threat to its export dominance;Wage pressures are building in China – even outside export-led zones, and in non-exporting industries . Yet any idea that the nation is about to surrender its status as the workshop of the world would be wide of the mark.Even for labour-intensive industries, labour costs can be a small fraction of the whole. At Foxconn International, which has in effect doubled wages for hundreds of thousands of assembly-line workers, staff costs (including pensions) are about 7 per cent of the cost of inventories. Moreover, many of the biggest producers have ample room to absorb pay rises. Between 1994 and 2008, on Nomura estimates, industrial enterprises showed 21 per cent annual labour productivity growth, while annual wage growth was just over 13 per cent. In other words, unit labour costs fell. Many humble contractors are now much more profitable than their developed-market customers. For example, the five-year average net profit margin at Zhejiang-based clothier Shenzhou International, a big supplier to Uniqlo and Nike, is 15 per cent – double that of Japan’s Fast Retailing (Uniqlo’s parent) and two-thirds higher than the US sports brand.Further, higher wage settlements do not necessarily lead to lower margins. Early movers like Foxconn, where full increases are effective from October 1, may find that at least some of those costs can be passed on to customers anxious to build inventories ahead of the peak fourth quarter. Even if they are not, there is always the option of shifting production further inland, where wage pressure isn’t as great, or even sub-contracting to Bangladesh. For the biggest, then, the pressure looks containable, especially if it spurs further consolidation around larger production units with bigger economies of scale. Rising wages, meanwhile, achieve real effective currency appreciation, and make a removal of the dollar peg less urgent. The “China price” looks safe for now.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
528;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-08T17:01:49Z;N Korea finds World Cup sponsors in Italy;;North Korea was part of the “axis of evil” identified by George W. Bush when US president and it is subject to sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme but, for a little-known Italian sportswear company, politics is no obstacle to sponsoring the country’s World Cup team.The stable of football clubs sponsored by Legea ranges from Welsh champions New Saints to struggling Italian sides, but its recent deal with North Korea marks the company’s debut in the World Cup big time.“We don’t have the power of Nike and Adidas so we have to find other ways for people to speak about us,” said Giuseppe Marinelli, Legea’s head of marketing. “Political issues have nothing to do with us,” he adds.For North Korea, which is reported to have turned down an offer of sponsorship from a Chinese company, the deal represents a welcome injection of cash.Mr Marinelli declined to reveal details of the contract, involving supply of the team’s all-red kit bearing the Legea logo. However, he said it was less than the €4m ($4.8m, £3.3m) over four years previously reported and included “a ­little cash”.Legea said it contacted the North Korean football federation two months ago and haggled over the telephone for three days. North Korean officials visited company headquarters in Pompei, near Naples, and a deal was struck. “Their way of thinking was rather different from that in the west, but we finally succeeded,” Mr Marinelli said.Ranked 105th in the world, North Korea kick off on Tuesday against Brazil in Johannesburg in the G “group of death” that includes Portugal and Ivory Coast. Star striker Jong Tae-a is known as “the People’s Wayne Rooney”, after the England striker. But his partner in attack, Kim Myong-won (“The Chariot”), will have to play as goalie, if at all, because of a North Korean mix-up in submitting the names of its squad members.Sponsorship by an Italian company also carries some irony, as the last time North Korea competed in the World Cup, in 1966, they caused one of the biggest upsets in soccer history by defeating Italy 1-0.“It’s a good deal,” said Nigel Currie, director of brandRapport, a UK sponsorship consultancy. He described the move as a “backdoor entry” for Legea into the expensive world of high exposure dominated by the big brands, which pay the top teams tens of millions of euros a year in sponsorship.“They will get unbelievable exposure. Chucking the politics aside, to get in front of a cumulative audience of 26bn, it is a good way to do it. Politics won’t come into people’s thinking . . . and once you get to a reasonable size in this market you get bought by Nike or Adidas.”

Investors may be tired of Spain’s budget deficit woes, but its football team is already a well-backed favourite to win the World Cup in South Africa, which kicks off on Friday. Picking England to lose in the semi-final on penalties, at around 12-to-one odds, is perhaps a better balance of risk and reward. Looking for stock market kickers requires similar creativity.Beverages naturally head the line-up for industries to benefit: beer and football are familiar partners. Macquarie expects the average fan in South Africa to consume 51 litres of the stuff. Quenching thirsts will be the host nation’s SABMiller, which controls about 90 per cent of its domestic market. Although the brewer’s expected 4-6 per cent increase in domestic volume may not lift earnings materially, the tournament is a favourite marketing opportunity in other football-crazy emerging markets.FIFA World Cup partner Coca-Cola has its own previous performance to beat. During the 2006 tournament in Germany it recorded 15 per cent volume growth in the country, compared with none the previous quarter, notes UBS. Rexam, the can producer, should see good demand for high-margin promotional packaging. There are obvious football-related stocks such as sportswear maker Nike and Electronic Arts, which makes the official World Cup computer game. But such occasions are only theirs to lose.Instead consider local stock Bidvest, a company set to benefit directly but whose logo is not splashed all over TV screens. The behind-the-scenes logistics group, already well established in Europe and the Far East, provides everything from airport handling to food services. At 12 times prospective earnings, the group trades at a 16 per cent discount to global peers. It could prove to be this tournament’s dark horse.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
530;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-06-03T15:59:56Z;Guest column: Moral good, financial gain;;"The law of unintended consequences, made popular by Robert Merton in the 1930s, has received renewed interest of late – perhaps now that life is less predictable and at the same time more documented.The unforeseen outcome of an event can be good (aspirin also prevents heart attacks) or bad (1920s prohibition also produced organised crime). It is rarer that a moral good produces a commercial one. But in the case of Marks and Spencer’s Plan A, that is what has happened.We set up Plan A in 2007 to pursue 100 commitments on social, environmental and ethical challenges in climate, waste and recycling, sustainable raw materials, fair partnerships and health. We have achieved 62 – and are also gaining financial returns from Plan A.This month we publish our audited report on Plan A for 2009-10. It shows additional profits of £50m ($73m) – rather than a planned cost of £40m – from a range of eco-efficiencies: less waste, less fuel, less energy, less packaging; and from new income streams such as M&S Energy.We know now that there is a significant commercial return for “going green”, not just a moral one. It is almost classic utilitarian “greatest good for the greatest number”.Companies such as Walmart, O2, Unilever and Nike understand the green imperative commercially and have embarked on their own eco-ethical journeys.Yvon Chouinard, chief executive at Patagonia, the clothing company, simply says: “Every time we do the right thing, we make money.”What happens when we put Plan A at the heart of how we do business? First, Plan A has driven cultural change within M&S, where countless altered operating procedures have produced incremental savings; small aggregated changes in behaviour have amounted to large energy savings; and new eco-technologies in store design or refrigeration have had a marked commercial impact.Second, Plan A has driven us to innovate and discover new markets. For instance, M&S Energy has nearly 300,000 customers; and we have launched a home insulation service. This “greening the home” market will be worth billions; we want a significant share of it.Third, in operations, Plan A has helped us align interests and apply performance measurement. Board remuneration is in part based on Plan A; store managers have incentives to cut energy use. Getting the support and ownership of our finance team has been crucial in creating the right incentives for sustainable business behaviour.And fourth, our supply chains benefit from what we have learned: “ethical and eco model” factories in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the UK are teaching thousands of other suppliers through our Supplier Exchange website.Last year we shared our Bangladesh best practice with others (including Gap, Nike, Levi Strauss, Disney, New Look, Hennes, and Walmart). We encouraged them to join or replicate the programmes, benefiting workers irrespective of retailer or brand. We in turn have learned from Unilever and Walmart.We are now accelerating Plan A, and to support this effort we have established an innovation fund to help build a sustainable business. We aim to be the world’s most sustainable leading retailer by 2015. Sustainability is crucial to our success.The programme has to be thorough and well considered, as benefits in conjoined areas maintain a dynamic equilibrium. For example, how do we balance the environmental impact of air-freighting some food and flowers from Africa with the benefits that arise from creating secure jobs there?In a McKinsey survey last year of 1,500 executives, about half picked the environment as one of three issues they thought would attract the greatest amount of public and political attention, and most affect shareholder value. Plan A is starting to do both, positively.Sir Stuart Rose is chairman of Marks and Spencer."
531;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-05-28T20:00:17Z;China: Showing the strain;;"Terry Gou is used to having everything under control. When an earthquake struck during Hon Hai’s annual meeting a few years ago, and investors interrupted his presentation with frightened screams, the company’s founder and chairman silenced them with a stern look and a few words: “It’s just an earthquake!”That approach runs through Hon Hai – also known by its trade name, Foxconn – the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, which for two decades has operated according to three principles: authority, control and discipline.But now everything is not under control. The centre piece of Mr Gou’s manufacturing empire, a vast factory town in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, housing 300,000, has been shaken by a spate of suicides. Since the start of the year 12 workers have jumped from buildings; 10 have died – three in the past week.The deaths have stoked criticism of working conditions at Foxconn and, by extension, all of southern China. In a region covered with factories, Foxconn is the “workshop of the world” writ large, an institution symbolising the best and worst of the country’s manufacturing miracle and the legions of migrant workers who have laboured to build it.International controversy over working conditions in the south is nothing new. Western clothing brands, such as Timberland and Nike, and multinational retailers, such as WalMart, that benefit from the region’s low production costs, have all attracted foreign criticism. But the deaths at Foxconn have prompted a broader debate within China itself. While the company and local authorities say personal reasons were behind each death, critics claim that a high-pressure and isolating work environment raised the risk of suicide. Across the country academics, labour advocates and young people are comparing their nation to an inhumane industrial revolution-era world dominated by the search for progress and profits.“When I look at Foxconn, I feel reminded of Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times,” said an anonymous contributor to one online forum. “They show a world in which human beings are being degraded to gearwheels in a huge machine. Isn’t that exactly what’s happening here right now?” Another wrote: “This is not just Foxconn’s crisis, it is our crisis, our tragedy.”Foxconn’s customers are growing nervous. Sony, which declined to comment on the suicides this week, on Friday joined HP, Dell and Apple in saying it was re-evaluating working conditions at its manufacturing partner. Analysts, however, say Foxconn is unlikely to lose orders over the incidents because the company is the backbone of the world’s electronics manufacturing system.For Yang Lixiong of Renmin university in Beijing, the incidents illustrate part of a bigger socio-economic problem. While China has benefited from globalisation, its workers have not, he argues. “Our country is in a race to the bottom because our only advantage is cheap labour, and therefore our development is built on a mountain of sweatshops.”This argument is not new. Indeed senior officials both in Beijing and in the provincial government in Guangdong, where Foxconn is based, have said the country must adjust its growth model to include higher-end, more sustainable economic activity.But such changes will be hard to implement, Prof Yang says, as the main official measure of performance is economic growth. “That means local governments have an incentive to squeeze the workers and support the companies to make a profit,” he says. “The only way to change that is to make policy dependent on what people at the bottom want, not those on the top.”This is unlikely to happen any time soon as the ruling Communist party shows no inclination towards introducing democracy. The government is, however, watching developments at Foxconn nervously as it wants to avoid unrest. Yesterday, Chinese media were instructed not to give the affair big coverage.Foxconn on Friday announced plans to raise wages by 20 per cent– from current basic pay of Rmb950 ($139, €113, £96) per month, with most workers earning Rmb2,000 including overtime – in a bid to calm the situation. Its global business model rests on a huge manufacturing base spread across China and beyond, employing 800,000, which has to function just in time – with no room for glitches or bad publicity.Nokia mobile phone handsets, iPods, HP computers, Sony PlayStations and digital cameras – most of these devices are made by contract manufacturers. And Foxconn, with T$1,959bn ($61bn; £42bn; €49bn) in revenues last year, is the biggest.It was a long road for Mr Gou to get there. Born in 1950 to Chinese refugees in Taiwan, he graduated from a maritime technology college. In 1974, with a loan from his mother, he started a garage workshop making plastic parts for television sets, later diversifying into personal computers. The next step was signing up foreign companies such as Dell to assemble their products, an operation he moved to southern China in 1988 when labour costs in Taiwan started rising.Throughout decades of expansion and diversification one thing has remained constant: Mr Gou’s tight control of all aspects of the business.This is partly underpinned by commercial logic. The branded electronics groups that make up his customer base demand high levels of confidentiality. Since products for rival brands might be rolling off the same production line, the group can win trust only by guaranteeing no design or technical detail will leak out of the factory or across to other brands. For this reason, Foxconn long refused to let outsiders into its plants. While that rule has been re­laxed, visitors remain subject to tight restrictions. “You could say that we operate in a high-security environment,” says a Foxconn executive. “Maybe that’s why Terry has become such a control freak.”Having built one of the most sophisticated manufacturing machines in the world, Mr Gou believes that he knows best how to run a factory. Criticism – whether from shopfloor workers, boardroom colleagues or investors – is dismissed. He is feared for the lectures he delivers to analysts or reporters from his seat on the podium in Hon Hai’s spartan staff canteen in its headquarters in Dirt City, a dreary Taipei suburb. In management meetings, executives who ask questions he considers silly are made to stand.Further down the corporate hierarchy, life is highly regimented. Foxconn’s workers receive three meals a day – prepared by the biggest kitchen in Asia – but must visit a certain one of the plant’s several canteens at a certain time. “Otherwise it’s just impossible logistically to feed so many people at the same time,” explains Liu Kun, a Foxconn spokesman.In the dormitories where about 90 per cent of workers live, doors must be kept shut at all times. On some production lines, there are restrictions on when they can go to the toilet.Despite these apparently harsh terms, jobs are sought after. “Working at Foxconn is not particularly bad,” says Qing Tong, a 28-year-old former Foxconn employee who recently published a book about her experiences. “It’s better than in most other factories.” Currently taking a break to raise her child, she hopes to work again but as a writer. She never finished school but says she has read up on many subjects since – in the company library and on the internet.Yet while queues of thousands of migrants still form daily at the Shenzhen recruitment centre, observers say the harsh regime will grow less attractive over time. “Our generation has a broader horizon, more access to information than our parents,” says Ms Qing. “The most important thing for us is to realise our values in life, no longer just endure.”A different generation, born at the height of the one-child policy between 1985 and 1995, is entering the labour market.“These only children have never worked the land, and they don’t have strong ties to their rural hometowns,” says Prof Yang. “They can take much less pressure than the first generation of migrant workers, so once they have some emotional trouble, they are more vulnerable.” This, some analysts argue, makes them more prone to consider suicide.Foxconn is not the only big company to face the trauma of a series of suicides. At France Telecom there has been a spate among office workers, 11 since the start of this year alone. Similar clusters have appeared around the world as people with a suicide risk imitate what they hear or see, says Michael Phillips of the Suicide Research and Prevention Center at Jiao Tong University. Foxconn has responded with similar arguments to criticism of its working conditions.This week, Mr Gou himself rushed to Shenzhen to address the crisis. He showed dozens of reporters around the plant and hosted a panel of psychology and sociology experts. He walked around the factory town, trying to bond with staff, and even ordered 1.5m square metres of net to be installed around buildings.And yet another young man jumped to his death within hours of his boss’s departure. Foxconn staff say they are at their wits’ end.“In the latest case, we even knew he was going to jump,” says one manager. “We sent two others to sleep next to him, and co-workers tried to hold him back. But he shook off their hands and jumped anyway. What on earth can we do?”"
532;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-05-23T20:45:23Z;Dollar’s rise to hit global US groups;;"Foreign exchange volatility could take its toll on the financial results of US multinationals such as Kraft, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Nike, in spite of efforts to blunt the effects through hedging.Each of these companies felt the effects of currency swings in their 2009 earnings, and they’re on track to sustain even greater forex-related ups and downs to their EPS for 2010.“This is definitely going to affect earnings,” says Matthew DiFrisco, a restaurant analyst at Oppenheimer, of the dollar’s recent run-up versus the Euro.McDonald’s, which generated 65 per cent of its revenues outside the US in 2009, reported a 15 per cent jump in revenues in Europe for the first quarter 2010 over the same period last year, but a gain of only 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. The euro has been struggling against the dollar this year, but was weaker against the greenback in early 2009.Kraft, which completed its acquisition of Cadbury in February, reported a revenue jump of 40.5 per cent in Europe for the first quarter of 2010 over the same period a year ago. Almost 31 percentage points of that jump was attributable to new revenues from Cadbury, while 8 percentage points came from favourable exchange rates.Coca-Cola’s operating income jumped 17 per cent in the first quarter over last year’s total, aided by a 9 per cent foreign exchange boost from a generally weak US dollar. In Eurasia and Africa, the currency boost was 13 per cent; in Europe, 6 per cent; 9 per cent in Latin America and 9 per cent in the Pacific region.Of the US consumer goods multinationals, Procter & Gamble is among the most active players in the area of foreign currency hedging, entering contracts of up to five years to protect it from exchange rate volatility. According to its annual report for 2009, P&G lost $1bn in income last year from its efforts to manage currency exposures, after recording a $1.4bn gain in 2008 through similar activities.In the first quarter of 2010, P&G recorded a loss of $595m from foreign currency contracts. The total notional value of the company’s forex derivatives as of March 31 was $12.3bn.Nike says it “hedges up to 100 per cent of anticipated exposures typically 12 months in advance, but has hedged as much as 34 months in advance.” For the quarter ended in February this year, Nike reported a gain of $210m from foreign exchange forward contracts and options.In its most recent quarterly earnings statement, McDonald’s informed investors that some 70 per cent of its non-US revenues are generated in Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and Canadian dollars. “If all four of these currencies moved by 10 per cent in the same direction compared with 2009, the company’s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 17 to 19 cents,” or almost 5 per cent, the company said."
533;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;A greener blueprint for industry;;It is hardly the most orthodox route to business success. Having spent two decades building a company with a leading position in a highly promising global industry, Bill McDonough and Michael Braungart have decided to take a back seat – not by selling out but by donating the intellectual property behind their enterprise to a non-profit organisation.Mr McDonough, a US architect, and Mr Braungart, a German chemist, head McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, an environmental consultancy based in Charlottesville, Virginia, which measures the “environmental footprint” of a product’s supply chain. Their process is based on an exceptionally rigorous set of criteria and is allied to a set of procedures for creating new chemicals that they call a “cradle-to-cradle” system.Until now, their methods have been a closely guarded secret. But they hope today’s launch of the Green Products Innovation Institute in San Francisco will be a mechanism to create hundreds of other businesses around the world using their method. The idea is to spread the philosophy much faster – and wider – than if the original entrepreneurs kept control of their ideas.At a most basic level, MBDC offers a variant on the idea of “ecological labels” – the various systems for assessing the environmental impact of the estimated 1bn types of manufactured products created last year. More broadly, however, their process is part of a debate among businesses, consumers and campaign groups over how to deal with growing energy use, global warming and the long-term build-up of toxic chemicals.There are currently four main appraisal models. One model involves a limited number of criteria and does not address the full “ecological impact” of a product. An example of such a system is that introduced by Tesco, the retailer. Rather than trying to assess a broad range of environmental criteria, Tesco looks purely at the carbon dioxide emissions from processes used to make a limited number of products, including toilet paper and orange juice.Another type are standards, such as the Blue Angel system in Germany, that cover a broader range of performance criteria but do not go very deep into the supply chain.A third set of metrics are both broad and deep but are “closed”, applicable normally to the products made by one company. For example, BASF, the chemicals group, and Nike, the sports company, have their own internal assessment procedures.The fourth group includes a wide and deep range of criteria and can also be applied to products by any company willing to pay for the necessary testing. This includes the McDonough/Braungart approach and another operated by TÜV Rhineland, a German technical services provider.Key to these assessments are a “lifecycle-based” approach that considers the impact of products on the environment all the way through their lives, as opposed to purely what happens when they are made or disposed of.According to Mr McDonough: “[Product] appraisal methods are highly important but they are essentially examining the past. What we are trying to do is create toolkits for innovation that can build the products of the future.” His most enthusiastic supporters agree. Jim Hackett, chief executive of Steelcase, a US furniture maker and a long-time client, says: “Michael and Bill have taken us from thinking that environmental policies might be no more than a fad to making these ideas a core part of the way we run the company.”In practice, the MBDC model involves two stages. First is the “analysis”, whereby companies are expected both to identify all the chemicals in their products and to go as far back as nine stages of the supply chain. This can be a tall order, given that many products contain thousands of parts sourced from all over the world and, often, a wide range of suppliers. A television set, for example, can contain more than 5,000 chemical ingredients.After determining the “environmental footprint” of the supply chain, Mr Braungart says the goal is “to reduce the number of chemicals that are bad …to a minimum, even though we accept that not in all cases can the figure be reduced to zero”.For instance, the company is working on a project with Philips to design a hairdryer. The product contains 500 ingredients: 460 meet his environmental criteria but 40 do not. Mr Braungart is collaborating with the company to cut the number of “bad” chemicals.The second aspect to the approach is to build a new supply chain based on “closed loop” processes. This means that materials used to create new products should be based on substances that have their origins in products that had a past life. In this way, substances can pass through multiple “cradles” of rebirth.The system is fundamentally different from the normal “cradle to grave” approach, in which materials are dug out of the ground or grown, transformed into products and then discarded at the “grave” stage without much thought about finding new ways to use them.A key aspect to this part of the process is the division of the world into what Mr McDonough and Mr Braungart call the “technosphere” – comprising manmade structures and goods – and the “biosphere”, comprising the natural environment. Where possible, they try to ensure that the materials in products can be transferred in and out of the technosphere as freely as possible, without causing damage to the biosphere, while using as much renewable energy as possible. “One of our principles is that waste [from existing products] should be food [for new ones],” says Mr Braungart.For the past five years MBDC, in conjunction with sister company Environmental Protection Encouragement Agen­cy, a scientific consultancy based in Hamburg and run by Mr Braungart, has handed out certifications for products. So far, just 300 have earned one – 100 in the past year.Critics say that one reason the number is so small is the complexity and cost of subjecting products to such a large degree of analysis. Walter Stahel, a Swiss engineer and architect whose ideas led to the cradle-to-cradle concept, says the McDonough/Braungart partnership is an “an over-purist approach that ignores the realities of business”.Ray Anderson, chairman of Interface, the US carpet maker and a man with a reputation for environmentally aware thinking, has also been vocal in questioning the MBDC approach as complicated as well as over-secretive and enclosed. “It seems to me that cradle-to-cradle is a ‘black box’ where it’s difficult to look inside,” he told the Financial Times recently.But the announcement of the new “green products” institute in San Francisco – which as part of its operating methods will open up the key guidelines behind cradle-to-cradle for scrutiny – has been enough to make Mr Anderson think twice about his earlier remarks.On hearing about the initiative, he now says: “This is a very welcome move and it seems to me to address many of my concerns. It should help to push on considerably the state of the art in terms of reducing the environmental impact of industry.”
534;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
535;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-05-10T19:42:41Z;Red Knights’ Man Utd offer to reflect decline;;Red Knights, the band of wealthy Manchester United fans preparing a bid for the deposed Premier League champions, will offer the owners in excess of £1bn having concluded that the value of the club is in decline, according to people familiar with the group.However, the Glazer family, who on Wednesday mark their fifth anniversary as club owners, have begun a media offensive to underline their determination not to sell, saying the pipeline of commercial deals point to sustained growth enabling the club to manage its debt burden.After United relinquished the Premier League title to Chelsea, the Red Knights, led by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O’Neill, on Monday issued a statement saying it was making progress in assembling its consortium, although the process was “complex and is taking time”.The offer, being put together by Nomura, involves anything between 15 and 45 investors. Ordinary fans would eventually be offered a stake in the club, although not as part of the initial offer.However, the Red Knights added they believed it was “wrong to offer above fair value” given the size of the club’s debt and that “headwinds” in football were likely to see that value fall.People familiar with Red Knights said it had revised downwards the club’s worth to about £1bn, citing credit market uncertainty, concerns about the football industry’s stability and that of broadcasters, competition from rivals Manchester City, the club’s Champions League quarter-final exit and the future of 68-year-old manager Sir Alex Ferguson.The offer can be expected within four weeks and would be above £1bn to reflect a premium on the club’s valuation, the people said. They also said they had in their ranks investors who claimed they had approached the Glazers with a £1bn offer at the beginning of the year.Advisers to the Glazers, whose ownership has triggered repeated protests from supporters, are doing their utmost to convey that the family was uninterested in any offer and that they are “in it for the long term”.Last week they revealed that the family had turned down a £1.5bn offer from the Middle East last year – a claim met with scorn by the Red Knights – and added that “there could well have been a £1bn offer” more recently.Despite the Glazers nursing debts of £717m, advisers talk up the financial health of the club. Since the £790m takeover in 2005, the club has secured more than £200m in commercial deals, not including its 13-year £303m deal with Nike, a family spokesman said. Commercial deals make up a quarter of club revenue.Advisers say the club has signed three new, but as yet unannounced, deals, among them one with a travel company that in value will be second only to its £90m four-year shirt sponsorship deal with Aon, the insurance company.United is also rolling out regional deals with mobile phone companies and hopes to negotiate a new deal with Nike on improved terms. “Commercial revenues will overtake matchday income in a very short period of time,” one adviser said.The Glazers completed a £500m bond issue in January aimed at lifting covenants and releasing money to help the family pay down high-risk payment-in-kind notes, which allow borrowers to roll over cash interest payments but which have risen to more than £200m.Advisers say the interest on these notes will rise 2 percentage points to 16.25 per cent in August because the club’s net debt has exceeded thresholds, but believe it will return to the current level in February.The Glazers are plainly aware of their unpopularity, but are not oblivious to fans’ concerns, advisers add, pointing to a turnround in the club’s customers relations service.They acknowledge that the downturn has hurt corporate hospitality sales at Old Trafford, but also argue that by removing restrictions, the new financial structure releases more money into the club for player transfers.“The Glazers’ one strategic aim is to put the best footballers on the pitch,” says one adviser. “Everything is impossible without Manchester United winning things. Nothing has changed.”
536;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Meet the dean: Stanford’s Garth Saloner;;It is probably inevitable if you work in Silicon Valley that the entrepreneurial bug will bite sooner or later. For Garth Saloner, that moment came in 2001. Up until that point he had been a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business for more than a decade.At the time, the tech bubble that had engulfed the Valley was deflating fast. “My timing was impeccable,” Prof Saloner says now. “Only an academic would decide that the time to take a couple of years [off] was after it had all come down around your ears.”The line, delivered with a strong undertone of his native South Africa that he left more than three decades ago, is ripe with the self-deprecating charm that surfaces when the conversation turns to anything personal. “I made modest amounts of money – in aggregate. You win some and you lose some,” he says.An economist by training, Prof Saloner decided to study electronic commerce as the dotcom boom took off, establishing the school’s Center for Electronic Commerce and Business two years before his sortie into the business world. But his plan – to work with a number of start-ups as a boardroom adviser – flopped when he discovered his influence beyond academia was limited. “With early-stage [companies] it’s the people who put in the money who call the shots in the end – probably as it should be.” That made his own role “interesting, but not a long-term career path [and] nowhere near as varied and challenging as being in the university, so I came back”.Now, Prof Saloner, who became dean of the business school last September, has had another taste of a pronounced financial downturn. A small school that admits only 370-380 MBA students a year, Stanford is far more exposed than most to the vicissitudes of the financial markets. Roughly half its income comes from alumni, either through direct donations or from its endowments funds.“Our endowment took a hit,” Prof Saloner says. Like Harvard and Yale, Stanford pursued an investment strategy with its endowment, something that has “served us very, very well if you take a long-term view – though in the short term you have a bigger hit than some. The income that comes [from] that is wiped out in a flash.”However, the new dean has at least had some fortunate timing. It fell to his predecessor, Robert Joss, to deal with the immediate budget shortfall by cutting staff. Significantly, an ambitious construction project that will see the school rehoused in purpose-built facilities – the $350m Knight Center, named after Phil Knight, founder of Nike – was already largely financed before the downturn.The smaller classrooms and more flexible spaces of this new development complement a curriculum overhaul that the business school embarked upon in 2007, based on a study led by Prof Saloner. The aim, he says, was to move away from the traditional teaching of basic business disciplines and to focus on personal development and leadership training.Had he foreseen the financial turmoil to come, would the school have taken on such big commitments?“I’m glad we did – those are big strategic things for us. It would have been harder to do had we known the extent of the financial reality. But having done it, we’re much better for it.”Asked if the school plans further curriculum adjustments to reflect lessons learnt during the crisis, he adds: “For the most part the changes we had made before the crisis were those we would have made in response to the crisis. I’m going to say we were prescient – probably a bit lucky.”The new course partly reflects Prof Saloner’s personal emphasis on the value of independent judgment and analytical thought. He believes the absence of these qualities was behind the meltdown on Wall Street.“As a management educator, you’re disappointed that so many people did not look below the short-term trends or the perceived wisdom.”That failure, he concedes, is a result of the “group-think” that can permeate business, regardless of how intelligent or well trained the individuals. “It stems from an unwillingness to think for yourself and go below the surface of whatever the conventional wisdom is on the subject.”Prof Saloner now teaches a class on critical analytical thinking – a subject all students must take. So does he think, when confronted with the reality of business failure, that the job of a school such as his is only to teach students to exercise independent judgment, rather than focus on issues of personal ethics?“I don’t make that distinction,” he says. “It’s about doing critical thinking through a lens of principles. We can’t teach [students] an ethical position.”Prof Saloner’s other passion has been to bring a broader international perspective to the school. Under a programme of international study he introduced, students have been on visits to countries mainly in the developing world – several of which he has led himself. Those trips fit a world view that owes something to a life spent largely outside his home country. But he clearly feels most comfortable back at Stanford.“I’m enormously comfortable in Silicon Valley and California,” he says. Yet even given his time spent in the US, the draw of this year’s Football World Cup will see him heading back to his birthplace. “Part of me is still South African,” he says.
537;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-05-08T00:25:28Z;Why anti-sweatshop campaigns might just do it after all;Two studies address the effects of economic growth on working conditions;When my book The Undercover Economist was published five years ago, I would occasionally be asked whether I was in favour of sweatshops in developing countries. Not at all, I would reply. But I could see where the question was coming from, because I was certainly worried as to whether campaigning against them would do any good.My argument had a logic that will be familiar to economists. Unless sweatshop workers are literally slaves, they are presumably working long hours in horrible conditions for low pay only because the alternative ways of making a living are worse.When a well-meaning group of activists launches a campaign against sweatshop labour among, say, Nike suppliers in Indonesia, the obvious risk is that the sweatshops are closed, workers are tossed out on to the street, and the work is shifted to computerised sewing machines in Osaka. This is surely not the aim. The only alternative is economic growth: while it may be frustratingly slow, it finishes off sweatshops by producing far more attractive jobs.But while the logic is straightforward enough, it is not watertight. A successful multinational may be profitable enough to be able to afford wage increases, and may prefer to take wage increases on the chin rather than move its business around. Economic growth itself can increase the demand for child labour as well as reducing the supply.So I was intrigued to discover two new pieces of research addressing these questions. One is an article in March’s American Economic Review, written by Ann Harrison of the University of California, Berkeley, and Jason Scorse of the Monterey Institute. Harrison and Scorse study data from Indonesia. In the 1990s, Indonesia was the focus of anti-sweatshop campaigns that persuaded the US government to put pressure on its Indonesian counterpart, and encouraged US consumers to boycott companies such as Nike. (An influential study in 1989 had found that Nike’s suppliers paid lower wages than other companies in the export sector.) Harrison and Scorse look at the footwear, textile and clothing sectors and compare regions with lots of brand-name suppliers to regions with lower-profile businesses.If my argument is correct, Harrison and Scorse would have found a slump in employment in export factories in the brand-name regions. There is little sign of this. Profits do fall, and so does investment. Some small plants closed. But few, if any, jobs seem to have been lost.The minimum wage in Indonesia more than doubled between 1989 and 1996, after inflation, and this did depress employment. But there seemed to be no additional effect in the districts with lots of brand-name suppliers, despite the fact that wages in those regions outpaced wage increases elsewhere by almost a third.The second paper was presented in draft form at the Royal Economic Society meeting in Guildford at the end of March. This research, by Nigar Hashimzade and Uma Kambhampati of the University of Reading, shows that economic growth – at least in the short-term – is not enough to reduce child labour. Complementary policies to strengthen schools and the incentive to attend them seem to be necessary.Neither piece of research is the last word, and neither discounts the long-term effectiveness of economic growth in improving working conditions. But I am having to think again about anti-sweatshop campaigns. At least I am in good company. John Maynard Keynes is reported to have quipped, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”Tim Harford’s latest book is ‘Dear Undercover Economist’ (Little, Brown)

Verdict: ()Nike has always pitched itself to two audiences with little inherently in common: athletes and the urban young. In its American home market, these groups are united by the cultural glue of basketball. Nike’s US ad men can shoot 30 seconds of Kobe Bryant dribbling, chatting or jumping over a speeding Aston Martin (as in a 2008 spot) and presto, a good percentage of their target demographic is catered to. There is no need to dilute the brand’s sport-is-everything message to appeal to the casual buyer. In Europe, football plays a similar role.Japan is trickier. Basketball is a minor sport. Football is popular but not associated with street fashion. There are legions of amateur runners, but courting them and the sedentary-but-stylish masses simultaneously is hard.For this three-minute internet spot, Nike’s agency, Wieden+Kennedy, has bypassed sport altogether. Two DJs set up their gear in a warehouse then plug in their mixers – not to turntables but to trainers that have been rigged to play sounds when twisted or smacked. Soon they launch into a thumping hip-hop tune, bending and slapping the trainers to create the beat. The spot is cleverly tactile – the trainers seem supple, even though we haven’t seen anyone running in them.Yet, ultimately it feels gimmicky. The same sound-production trick, you sense, could have been done with a sackful of potatoes."
539;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:00:27+0000;Recyclable footwear;;There have been many adjectives applied to women’s shoes – architectural, fetishistic, kittenish in the case of this season’s popular mid-height heels – but ecological isn’t one. Until now. As Earth Day, a day designed to inspire awareness of the environment, celebrates its 40th anniversary, the latest trend in sustainable fashion has emerged: the recyclable shoe.An estimated 300m shoes are thrown out in the US each year, says Ken Barker, a former Adidas and Levi’s executive who now runs Naturally Advanced Technologies (NAT), a green clothing company. “The landfill impact of shoes is considerable,” says Barker. “There’s a lot of rubber in most footwear, and I don’t believe it’s too dissimilar from automobile tyres – yet you can’t throw the tyres into landfill, you have to recycle them.”So why not the same for rubber shoes? Terra Plana, founded by Galahad Clark of the Clark’s footwear company, uses environmentally-friendly vegetable dyes as well as recycled materials in the production of its shoe soles. US footwear brand TOMS makes shoes from recycled plastic bottles and recycled rubber. Green Silence sneakers by the sports wear brand Brooks are made from recycled materials and claim to use 50 per cent less oil and energy in their creation than used in a standard style.It’s not yet easy, however, to create a profitable 100 per cent recyclable shoe. The first challenge is the complexity of the shoes’ construction, especially modern performance sneakers. Most pairs have at least 40 different components stitched or glued together, each of which must be individually handled for recycling. The American TV presenter and eco activist Summer Rayne Oakes says: “That’s what makes shoes much more complicated – they have so many moving parts. It’s not as easy as taking a T-shirt made of organic cotton and just recycling it.”Considerable advances have, however, been made by Terra Plana. In its POP collection, each shoe is made from only 12 components with a glueless construction that can be disassembled more easily once discarded. The Brazilian footwear brand Melissa, known for its sophisticated and colourful jelly shoes, uses a flexible thermoplastic called Melflex that, despite its man-made appearance, is 100 per cent recyclable.The bigger footwear groups, meanwhile, are increasingly recycling old products. Timberland’s Second Life programme allows consumers to return any worn shoes for reprocessing. NAT’s Ken Barker points to Nike as a pioneer in this field, with its two-decade-old Grind programme, which now processes 1.5m pairs of shoes a year into a material that is used for athletic and playground surfaces, as well as other Nike-brand products. It also encourages the return of discarded shoes for recycling.The ultimate goal, however, is to make shoes from components that will biodegrade as readily as apple cores. NAT’s Barker is working with two large footwear companies to produce shoes using his hemp-based, fully biodegradable Crailar fabric, while the Simple Shoes Bio-D range uses a pellet mixture of microbes added to the usual plastic and rubber to accelerate biodegradation.……….Detailswww.brooksrunning.comwww.melissaplasticdreams.comwww.nikereuseashoe.comwww.simpleshoes.comwww.terraplana.comwww.tomsshoes.com
540;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-04-13T20:17:48Z;Puma gives the boot to cardboard shoeboxes;;Puma is to eliminate the humble cardboard shoebox and plans to produce half of its sportswear from sustainable sources as part of a push to use ethical credentials to steal a march on rivals.Jochen Zeitz, chief executive, said Puma wanted to become the “most sustainable” sportswear company, but offered collaboration with other companies on its packaging technology, which includes the use of a corn starch-based product to replace plastic in wrapping clothing and in carrier bags in the group’s stores.The initiatives by the world’s third-largest sporting goods maker – which vies for consumer spending with Adidas, its German neighbour and rival, and Nike of the US – shows how environmental concerns are prompting consumer goods companies to alter production and marketing methods.Mr Zeitz said Puma had decided to pre-empt any potential legislation that would enforce more environmentally sustainable practices. “Puma must face the reality that neither its business nor the retail industry are currently sustainable in a way that does not affect future generations,” the company said.Mr Zeitz also said Puma would follow the growing trend of linking some of the pay of senior executives to susceptibility. Managers around the world will be judged on how much carbon emissions are reduced in their own operations, he said. “Money is an important way of changing behaviour,” he added.A number of other companies – led by those from the Netherlands, including DSM, TNT and Akzo Nobel – have linked executive pay to improving the environment, as well as other matters such as employee and customer satisfaction. Heineken, the Dutch brewer, announced a similar plan on Tuesday.Puma has unveiled a reusable bag to replace boxes for shipping shoes from factories to consumers from late next year. The company also said at least half its footwear, clothing and accessories would in time be produced from recycled or organic products.Puma’s initiative comes as it and its competitors gear up for the football World Cup in South Africa this year, one of the most important platforms for sports goods marketing.Puma, owned by PPR, the French luxury goods group, said its new packaging and production methods would initially increase costs. “If you buy recycled material or organic it costs more …we hope there will be more [cheap] supplies in the future,” Mr Zeitz said.He also called for the EU to end the practice of imposing anti-dumping duties on products from Vietnam and China, saying that would help Puma spend on sustainable methods of production. Vietnam is the source of about 30 per cent of Puma’s production.Last month, Nike said it would use recycled plastic bottles to make football shirts for the World Cup.
541;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-04-10T03:20:27Z;Tiger Woods’ return draws in millions;;Tiger Woods has dispelled doubts about his continued commercial appeal by drawing record-breaking television and online audiences for his return to professional golf after months of tabloid scandal.ESPN, the Walt Disney-owned sports channel with the rights to live coverage of the first two rounds of the US Masters, said the golfer’s first round of the Masters Tournament on Thursday had been “the most-viewed golf telecast in cable history”.An estimated 4.9m people tuned in to ESPN to see Mr Woods tee off for the first time since his admission of serial infidelity, 47 per cent above the audience for the opening day of the 2009 Masters and more than the 4.76m people who watched his Monday play-off with Rocco Mediate for the 2008 US Open championship.Mr Woods’ position high up on the leaderboard as he made his way around the course to applause from the packed crowds, bodes well for CBS, which will air the final rounds of the US Masters on Saturday and Sunday.“He’s perfectly positioned for this to be huge. This is about as good a set-up as you could have hoped for,” said Larry Gerbrandt, principal of Media Valuation Partners.“If he stays in contention on the final day, I think we could definitely have a shot at breaking all-time records.”Mr Woods holds the record for the most watched Masters, when 20.3m viewers watched him win the tournament for the first time in 1997, or 14.1 per cent of all US households, according to Nielsen.CBSSports.com, which showed the first day’s play online, reported that more than 556,000 unique users, more than double the visitors it had seen a year earlier, watched 71 per cent more live video.Mr Woods also cemented his commercial rehabilitation this week with a black-and-white advertisement for Nike, his most loyal sponsor.In the ad he stares blank-faced at the camera, dressed in Nike-branded gear, as the voice of his late father intones “did you learn anything?”By Friday afternoon, the commercial had been watched 2m times on YouTube.Mr Woods was the most bankable star in sports.However, he was abruptly dropped by sponsors, including Accenture, after a late night car crash outside his house unleashed a torrent of lurid revelations about his personal life.A fortune in endorsements, broadcast rights and prize money is riding on his continued success.“For Tiger, this is about new sponsors and repairing his marketability, not necessarily getting old sponsors back,” Mr Gerbrandt said.
542;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-04-09T22:52:51Z;Brand Tiger Woods;The wisdom of Nike and Tag Heuer in staying with the golfer;"This weekend, the people at Nike and Tag Heuer are presumably very happy. After all, the photographs seen around the world this week have been of their man, Tiger Woods, at the Masters, wearing his Nike cap and shirt and Tag Heuer wristwatch. Steadfastly standing by their endorsee while other sponsors such as Accenture and AT&T sidled away after news of Woods’ marital misbehaviour broke at the end of last year, Nike et al are once again front and centre in the golf world, as the fallen superstar returns to the course.They are clearly betting that their loyalty will pay off, literally – that Woods’ talent (and need to prove himself) will trump any trace of moral ambiguity, driving weekend players into golf shops to try, once again, to dress like Tiger, in the hope it will help them to birdie like him. They are betting, in other words, on a certain kind of consumer psychology.But I wonder if it’s really that simple, because such a bet depends on two assumptions: (1) that Tiger’s fall from grace has made him less attractive as a front man; and (2) that it will change because if he wins, everyone will forget about his faux pas. All of which is general marketing wisdom. The problem is, I’m not convinced it holds true anymore.Certainly, the idea that we attempt to imitate other people’s success by dressing like them is at the core of many fashion sales strategies. Just consider the truism that if you want to be the boss you should dress like the boss – or the even more straightforward rationale behind the online fashion website asos.com, its name derived from the acronym for As Seen On Screen. It’s why brands sign up “ambassadors” such as Chanel’s socialite stylist Caroline Sieber and Christian Dior’s Charlize Theron, and why every fashion journalist is inundated with press releases the day after an awards show, announcing which celebrity wore which brand. Forests of glossy paper have been sold on the basis of providing information on what famous people are wearing, so those who want to be famous too can dress like their idols.But increasingly, the concept of being “famous” – or even “successful” – is losing its moral dimension and becoming synonymous with “notorious”; all seem to be defined as “with a recognisable name”.Think about it. Last year Levi Johnston (Sarah Palin’s ex-not-quite-son-in-law) starred in an advertisement for pistachios; Paris Hilton shilled for hamburger chain Carl’s Jr. Katie Price moves novels, and multiple Pop Idol contestants have had their spokesperson moments. None of these is necessarily an individual that others want to emulate (at least I hope not), yet their notoriety somehow elevates them into the realm of what sociologists would call “influencers.” Which makes me wonder if it’s their humanity – their fallibility, their naked desire for their 15 minutes of fame – that constitutes their attraction; that, in fact, it’s precisely their non-superiority that makes them effective sales agents.Put another way, as much as we like our superstars and want to emulate them superficially, we also like people to whom we can relate – or even feel superior – internally. This is, after all, the basis of reality TV, which pretty much trumps what I consider the best written and acted shows (24, Glee, House) in the ratings every time. Watching C-list celebrities eat bugs in the jungle has the obsessive appeal of a train wreck. It’s not reverse psychology so much as absolution psychology: selling an experience that makes you glad you are you, as opposed to selling a product that makes you a better you. And its efficacy should not be underestimated – nor the implication that perhaps it was a mistake for the Woods’ team to doubt him during his period as a “tarnished champion”, “scandal-fatigued golfer” and whatever else they called him when the hoo-ha started. The publicity boost he experienced might, in fact, have worked to their own ends (the double entendres associated with various tag lines taking on a life of their own via the web and keeping his name very much in the public eye, while he himself was out of it). And it would be a corresponding mistake to assume a giant uptick in sales afterwards. Because maybe what has been going on over the last few months, in stores if not on the green, is, rather, par for the course. All puns intended.In fact, the revelation of Woods’ human foibles may have been a good thing, not just for the man himself but for his sponsors. Previously, for every sports fan who desired a Gillette razor because an automaton-like golfer used it, perhaps there was another who thought his malcoordination made the chance of nicks just too great. Since last December, of course, when it was revealed that Woods himself is far less than perfect, such a fear would be less of an issue.Sports gods are one thing, after all, but how much more accessible is a sports god whose feet of clay we can mould in our own image?vanessa.friedman@ft.com

543;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-04-07T21:52:55Z;When star power finds the rough;;As Tiger Woods prepares to tee off at The Masters on Thursday, the humbled athlete is not the only one counting the cost of his fall from grace. The 34-year-old golfer’s reputation as a clean-living and dedicated sportsman and husband was undone when his infidelities were spilled across television, newspapers and internet sites in the wake of a mysterious car accident at his home in late November.Mr Woods’ success on the course had enabled him to line up lucrative sponsorship deals off of it, with brands including Accenture, Nike, Gillette, Electronic Arts and Gatorade signing him up to lucrative sponsorship deals. Some estimates suggest that the arrangements made him the world’s first sports star to make $1bn in career earnings.But as his life became embroiled in scandal, those companies also took direct financial hits, from having to commission and produce new advertising to the costs of their own public relations campaigns explaining their actions in dropping the golfer and legal fees. According to a study by Christopher Knittel and Victor Stango, economists at the University of California, Davis, the stock market value of all the companies endorsed by Mr Woods collectively lost $5bn-$12bn by the middle of December.Of course, companies do not need a celebrity relationship to experience reputational damage. Toyota estimates that its global recall of cars this year had a direct cost of about $2bn (€1.5bn, £1.3bn). That figure does not take into account potential lost future sales, or Toyota’s own stock price decline, which has knocked Y1,673bn ($17.8bn, €13.3bn, £11.7bn) off its market value even after a strong rebound in the past month.The size of such losses is helping to fuel a growing debate about whether a corporate reputation is insurable – and about what exactly it is that a company would want to insure.In the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal, DeWitt Stern, the insurance broker, saw an opportunity to publicise a product it had launched to cover reputational risk, including how to deal with celebrity endorsers becoming engulfed in scandal. More recently, Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market, held a conference on how to manage reputational risk and what cover – if any – might be available.Reputation is a slippery issue not only because it can be hard to define exactly what it is until it has taken a knock, but also because people – and companies – can trade just as much off edgy or wild reputations as they can off good, clean ones.When Kate Moss, the supermodel, was caught taking cocaine in 2005, many of the brands she then represented, such as H&M, the retailer, ran a mile – but other, differently positioned names, such as Sir Philip Green’s Top Shop, soon took her on.“Kate Moss is an interesting example,” says Mark Borkowski, who runs an eponymous public relations agency. “The teenage brands fell apart, but Virgin and some other edgier brands moved straight in.”Companies are increasingly recognising that reputation is an important and valuable asset that is vulnerable and volatile, according to Anthony Fitzsimmons, chairman of Reputability, a consultancy focused on reputation and crisis strategy, risk and management.“Reputation can be an organisation’s most valuable intangible asset, though it appears in few balance sheets except as [goodwill in] acquisitions,” he says. “People are generally aware of their brand values, but many have not worked out what matters most when things are going wrong. Few have made a systematic analysis of what might damage their reputation, let alone worked out how to make their reputation intrinsically strong through difficult times.”However, Mr Fitzsimmons says that in discussions with insurers and reinsurers over a number of years he has been unable to find a way of protecting the full financial value of a reputation. “So far, the conclusion has always been that to cover the value of a corporate reputation in any meaningful sense is virtually impossible,” he says.Part of the problem is how to assess what a company is able to cover. There are the direct costs – such as product recalls, PR spending and lost profits – that might be relatively simple to work out. But what of the potential lost future sales from the long-term reputational damage? How should anyone assess how a company would have performed in an alternative future that has been forfeited?If markets are efficient – a theory with fewer adherents than ever after the market turmoil of the past two years – then the value of what a company will do in future should be reflected in its current share price. But even if markets were efficient, there is still the problem of when an insurer or investor measures what has been lost.The University of California, Davis study took the difference between the value of Mr Woods’ corporate partners on the day of the crash and a day in mid-December that was one week after he announced his indefinite break from golf. An arbitrary call.Similarly with Toyota, the shares had lost Y3,173bn at their worst a little more than one month after the first recall was announced in January, but have since recovered almost half that loss. In a year’s time, they might be worth more than before the recalls. But determining which part of the stock’s move in price is to do with reputation and which part is to do with the broader economy or market is a further complicating factor.None of this has stopped insurers beginning to offer some sort of cover for reputational risk. Companies such as AIG – now called Chartis – have for a few years been augmenting traditional Directors & Officers policies with extras such as “spin-doctor cover” to pay for the publicists and brand consultants needed if a company’s reputation takes a hit.Dan Trueman at Kiln, a Lloyd’s of London insurer that is involved in the DeWitt Stern product, says that because companies have become increasingly concerned about insuring intangible assets such as reputation, insurers have focused on what they can insure. “The risks that keep company directors awake at night are no longer about the tangible assets, such as a building burning down,” he says. “It is much more about the intangible – reputations, moving data around, intellectual property and counterfeiters.”The most important costs from all these risks are in the short-term loss of revenues that often result, along with legal and communications costs – and not the muddier concepts of goodwill or share price.“The maximum indemnity period tends to be a year, but most important is the first few days, including the PR and crisis management,” he says. “The longer term does not matter nearly so much as continuing to generate revenues in the near term. Most clients only want six months’ cover.”Mr Trueman’s clients have included not only makers of things, such as pharmaceutical and technology companies, but also law firms and a private school in Australia worried about unsuitable people slipping through safety and criminal checks to work with children.But the heightened awareness of reputational risks and the short-term nature of the insurance are, in fact, symptoms of the same condition: the multi-faceted, ever-present modern media. This means that reputational crises can erupt and spread quickly, but if combatted well can burn out just as fast.“In the digital world, everyone can comment on your product or brand immediately and you have to be aware of what people are saying about your brand,” says Mr Borkowski. “There will be a time when Twitter gets a billion followers [and] that’s a huge conversation. As a company you have to have the resources to monitor and respond to that – and quickly.”
544;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-04-02T18:06:41Z;Man in the News: Tiger Woods;The golfer returns with a twin mission, writes Jurek Martin: rehabilitate himself with the public, and revive the sport;"Tiger Woods appeared in this space two summers ago after winning the US Open, the last of his 14 major golf championships, with a double stress fracture in his left leg. It was noted then that for all his status as the most visible sportsman on earth he remained a closed book, his private life, beyond the bare bones, a complete mystery.It will be a fallen idol who steps on to the first tee among the blooming azaleas and dogwoods at Augusta National for the Masters Championship on Thursday. Salivating television executives are already describing his return to competition after a self-imposed four-month hiatus as the biggest event since the inauguration of President Barack Obama.Parts of the closed book have become a tawdry public read, ever since last Thanksgiving night outside his Florida home – a smashed SUV, a semi-conscious superstar, a club-wielding wife – set in train revelations exposing him as a sex addict, with numerous affairs with bar girls and nightclub hostesses only too willing to reveal his prowess in bed and their bodily charms all over the internet and tabloids.He fell from commercial grace, too. Some sponsors, above all Nike, remained faithful, but others dropped him like a stone. The face that blazoned a thousand airports for Accenture, the consulting firm, became a non-person. Professional golf as a whole is in a funk without him, its television ratings down 30-40 per cent and no young gun or veteran player filling his shoes. Not all its woes can be attributed to Woods – the carmakers and banks that underwrote a third of tournaments two years ago have pulled back, depleted by the credit crunch. Even the amateur game is suffering, three times as many courses closing last year as opening.So he returns to the stage next week with a twin mission – to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of a once uncritical public and to revive the sport that made him famous. For both, he must win, and win soon, but it is hard to say which the more formidable challenge is.Woods the man still has not revealed much of himself. There was one halting public statement in front of cameras but with the pesky media excluded, and two brief, controlled interviews with sporting television channels in which he declared his private life still off-limits (and also his in-patient therapy at the Mississippi clinic specialising in sexual addiction). In the first, he appeared shattered, a deer caught in headlights, as he recited the predictable litany of apologies, to his wife, family, fans and sponsors. He mentioned as factors his exaggerated sense of entitlement and departure from the Buddhist teachings instilled by his Thai-born mother. In the second, he intoned, almost mechanically: “I’d been living a lie.”Most psychologists would include the death of his father four years ago as a tipping point. Earl Woods was a hard-driving military man, mentor, tutor and controlling influence over his son, once likening his progeny to Gandhi. But Earl was no saint; his second marriage, to Tida, Tiger’s mother, ended in estrangement, and the scuttlebutt on the circuit was of a man who often took what he wanted without asking.Close observers detected the change on the course last year. There was a foul-tempered club-throwing incident in Australia in November. Michael Jordan, the retired basketball superstar and an adviser to the US team at October’s Presidents Cup, thought, presciently, that Woods was “putting himself under more pressure” than he had previously detected.If he remains on an emotional hair-trigger, Augusta is the safest place to resurface, and not simply because he is a four-time Masters champion. It may be a high-pressure event but the environment is the most tightly controlled in golf, run not by the professional tour but by the club itself, self-appointed dean of its cathedral. It brooks no heretics, banning reporters considered insufficiently respectful. Any heckler who yells out the name of Jamie Jungers or any other Woods dalliance will be thrown off the grounds by Pinkerton-clad heavies, not just for the day but for life. Subsequent tournaments, however, will be more fraught with danger.Nor will he lack support from his fellow professionals because, whatever their private feelings, they need him, badly. Because of him, prize money on the tour has grown four-fold since he joined it in 1996. In that year, only nine golfers won $1m; last year 91 did, a powerful testament to his trickle-down effect on the journeyman player. The tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, is beating about the bushes, with some success, to bring in new sponsors to replace the departed banks and car companies, even if the Waste Management Open does not trip off the tongue as easily as the Buick. But, minus Woods, a lucrative new television contract may be hard to negotiateThe players also know that nobody, and particularly no American, has filled the void. The tour has frantically tried to publicise newcomers – Anthony Kim, Camillo Villegas, Rory McIlroy – but they are not consistently there yet. The fan-friendly Phil Mickelson remains what he has long been, great on his day but not every day, while the other erstwhile leading rival, Vijay Singh, has been hampered by knee (and putting) problems. Amiable Ernie Els of South Africa has his game back after a long absence, but he is another foreigner on a circuit increasingly dominated by non-Americans (two Englishmen, Ian Poulter and Paul Casey, contested the Match Play final in February). For all, or, indeed, because of, his mixed-race bloodlines, Woods is definitively American – and the US tour remains his main stage.The storybook start to the next chapter would have him winning the Masters, smiling and fist-pumping his way round the course and embracing his reconciled wife, Elin, and two children on the 18th green. Messy reality may find his game not sharp after months away, the grin may be forced and the family may not be there when it is over, win or lose. He has conceded his marriage is now a new work in progress, thanks to his transgressions, and the daughter of a former Swedish government minister may not be the average, supportive golfer’s (or politician’s) wife. But, for a week at least, golf, not war, peace and healthcare, will top everybody’s agenda."

The company plans to open a second store early next year in Sydney.Gap has also announced plans to expand into China and Italy this year with company owned stores.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, has made international expansion a central part of his efforts to boost Gap’s sales. Even with the additions, Gap still operates in fewer than 30 countries, compared with its rivals Zara and H&M, which have stores in 75 and 40 different countries respectively.Mr Murphy told analysts earlier this month that the retailer would seek to expand its existing franchise store networks, which reach less than a third of their country’s potential markets.The retailer is also planning to launch a European e-commerce site based in the UK later this year to serve 10 western European countries, and to open online sites in Canada and China.International and online business accounts for about 20 per cent of Gap’s $14.2bn in revenues.Mr Laban joined Gap from Nike earlier this year, where he had headed Nike’s retail stores in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which include franchise stores. He previously led the global retail network at Germany’s Escada fashion brand.

548;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-18T01:05:49Z;Nike upbeat as retail orders increase;;Nike said on Wednesday it was seeing stronger forward orders from retailers in the US and western Europe, in another indicator of a recovery in discretionary spending.The improving performance at the sports shoe and clothing company, contrasted with quarterly results this month from Adidas, its German rival, which reported flat sales, excluding foreign exchange impacts, and saw its shares fall after a conservative sales forecast for 2010.Both companies are expecting a boost in sales from the 2010 football World Cup in South Africa. Nike said its UK Umbro brand had seen strong sales of England shirts – and also new Manchester City shirts – during the fourth quarter.Nike’s orders for delivery between March and July were up 9 per cent at $7.1bn against the same period last year, or 6 per cent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Last year, orders, excluding forex impacts, fell 2 per cent.Forward orders in the US were up 4 per cent against last year’s 1 per cent fall, in what the company said was a broad-based recovery. Its businesses in Japan, eastern Europe and Russia saw declines in orders, reflecting continuing macroeconomic pressures. In North America, Nike highlighted the strong performance of its direct-to-consumer business, with stores reporting a 17 per cent increase in same-store sales and its online business seeing sales up 20 per cent.Mark Parker, chief executive, expressed satisfaction with a 6 per cent increase in revenues in its North American apparel business, which has benefited from a drive to improve productivity with a greater focus on fewer styles.Nike’s revenues in North America increased by 1 per cent to $1.7bn, contributing to a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $4.7bn, with its international revenues supported by the weak dollar.In western Europe, the company’s orders for the March-July period were up 7 per cent against last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In China, orders are up 9 per cent on the same basis. Revenues in China rose 10 per cent to $458m.Nike reported earnings of $496m, or $1.01 per diluted share, double the third quarter last year when earnings were affected by costs related to its acquisition of Umbro. Earnings were supported by higher operating margins as the company cut costs and lowered inventories to reduce the need for markdown sales. Its shares rose more than 3 per cent to $73.30 in after-hours trading.
549;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-17T02:40:54Z;‘Fujian Tigers’ become sneaker powerhouses;;A small and little-known city in eastern China’s Fujian province makes three claims to fame: it boasts the country’s earliest seafaring vessels, a large Islamic temple – and an odd cluster of sneaker companies.At least 10 firms in Quanzhou city make athletic shoes, and four have listed on overseas stock markets. Known collectively as the “Fujian Tigers”, these brands started out stitching together shoes for the likes of Nike and Adidas, then found success under their own names by selling into lower-tier cities.Their sudden emergence sets a crucial piece of received wisdom on its ear: it is no longer true that reliable retail sales of branded products can be generated only in China’s top cities.Foremost among the Fujian Tigers is Peak Sport Products, a family-run company that now ranks among China’s best-known sportswear brands. The company listed in Hong Kong in September 2009 and now has a market capitalisation of US$1.4 bn on the back of regular annual revenue increases of 60 per cent or more. Peak’s turnover is likely to exceed US$500m sometime in 2011.Such eye-popping growth comes at a time when most leading foreign brands are struggling, and Adidas is suffering double-digit declines. Peak’s story underscores both the growing importance of China’s consumer class and the emergence of competitive domestic brands.The key to understanding Peak’s rise to a sneaker powerhouse can be found by looking where its shoes are not available. Visitors to China’s biggest cities – Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou – will likely search in vain for a Peak outlet.Peak is instead expanding fast into second-tier cities and below, all the way down to county towns – markets where the China’s biggest athletic shoe sellers, Nike and Adidas, fear to tread.Like a guerrilla strategist, Peak has abandoned China’s large cities to its powerful foreign competitors and instead occupies territory exclusively in the hinterland, where incomes have crossed a critical threshold. People in these once-impoverished places can now pay for holidays, home-video systems and branded shoes – and they want them.Peak now has more than 6,000 retail outlets and is opening another three every day. Nike and Adidas, by comparison, each have about 3,500 stores in China.Peak’s goal is to gain first-mover advantage by opening the maiden athletic-footwear store in major shopping districts across China. Most homegrown brands share this strategy and are growing at a similar clip.Peak’s most mature local competitors are Li Ning and Anta. There is also growing competition from Dongxiang, which owns the China licence to the Italian sportswear line, Kappa. Based on phenomenal growth, its market capitalisation is higher than Li Ning’s even though Li Ning boasts higher margins and twice the market share.Most observers think the lower-tier markets will be saturated within five years. Such congestion will lead to a shakeout, with the strongest and best-organised companies winning. By then, Peak and friends are betting they will be ready to move into the gem markets of Beijing and Shanghai.It is unlikely that Peak will ever offer top-quality, high-performance shoes. But Peak CEO Xu Zhihua says being a value brand is good enough. “What would you rather be?” he asks. “The company with the highest-tech products or the biggest profits? We’ll be the Toyota of shoes.”Matthew Forney is president of Fathom China, an independent research company that conducts due-diligence investigations on firms and executives in China.
550;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-04T21:51:07Z;GDF Suez rekindles spirit of Lesseps;;GDF Suez has been steadily returning to its old Suez Canal roots. Gerard Mestrallet, the Franco-Belgian group’s chairman and chief executive, is the first to acknowledge this. After all, it all began in the mid-19th century with the Suez Canal Company and the global vision of Ferdinand Lesseps to build and manage an ambitious infrastructure project linking west and east, he says. But when Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal in 1956, the company was forced to reinvent itself as a financial services group.Then in 1995, Mr Mestrallet became chief executive of what was still known as the Compagnie Financière de Suez and set about radically changing the group’s focus from finance back to its industrial origins. He orchestrated a series of big mergers – five in all – with the biggest by far the combination of Suez and Gaz de France transforming the new GDF Suez group into one of the world’s leading utilities in the energy and water treatment businesses.The analogy with Ferdinand Lesseps goes further. For these days, the group already generates as much electricity in the Middle East (about 20,000 megawatts) as it does in its two traditional home markets combined – France and Belgium. The share of the Middle East is expected to keep growing in the company’s overall international energy portfolio, notwithstanding the loss by the French consortium that also included GDF Suez of a multi-billion dollar nuclear reactor contract in Abu Dhabi.Indeed, Mr Mestrallet on Thursday confirmed that GDF Suez has been chosen by Saudi Arabia as the kingdom’s preferred bidder to construct a $2bn gas powered electricity plant. Prospects in Saudi Arabia are particularly encouraging given the country wants to double its present electricity generating capacity from 30,000MW to 60,000MW by 2020.In spite of the loss of the Abu Dhabi contract to South Korea, GDF Suez is still the emirate’s largest electricity producer. Mr Mestrallet nonetheless concedes France needs to draw on the lessons from the Abu Dhabi nuclear fiasco.In short, the South Koreans won the deal because they offered a cheaper and a less sophisticated reactor technology instead of proposing an “expensive French nuclear Ferrari” made all the more expensive by the strength of the euro against the dollar at the time.That is why Mr Mestrallet is seeking French government approval to construct in France the first plant using a smaller nuclear reactor being jointly developed by Areva, the French state-controlled nuclear group, and Mitsubishi of Japan. “France simply cannot rely on just its single top of the line EPR nuclear reactor to win contracts abroad. It must broaden its offer with other products such as the smaller Atmea reactor,” he argues.But Mr Mestrallet is also keeping an eye wide open on the western hemisphere, especially Brazil, to pursue his international expansion.In Brazil, GDF Suez is already generating 14,000MW of electric power or an equivalent amount to what it produces in Belgium – the big difference being that 80 per cent of the power produced in Brazil is hydroelectric while in Belgium it is mainly nuclear.Brazil last month gave the green light for the construction of a giant hydroelectric dam at Belo Monte in the Amazon rain forest and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appears keen for GDF Suez to join the bidding for the $15bn project, which is designed ultimately to produce 11,000MW of energy.Controversy, however, is already raging over this Pharaonic work with environmentalists and other activist groups fighting to block the project, defending the interests of indigenous tribes and warning of the additional damage that this is likely to cause to the Amazon basin. Meanwhile, the construction of the Suez Canal was also riddled with controversy. History has a knack of repeating itself.World Cup goalsThe last soccer World Cup held in Germany in 2006 gave the sportswear ry a significant boost. Sales of football shirts shot up by 33 per cent that year and those of trainers – designer or otherwise – by about 15 per cent.Leading sportswear makers – Adidas, Nike, Puma – are crossing their fingers that the World Cup, in South Africa this June, will lift the industry from its doldrums. For the past year, as Adidas showed this week with a 62 per cent fall in 2009 profits, has been tough. The economic crisis and lack of big sporting events last year resulted in a 5 per cent fall in worldwide sales of sportswear and equipment. And in spite of the World Cup, prospects for a strong sales recovery this year look slim.european.view@ft.com
551;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-04T01:08:17Z;Clinton in LatAm: Brazil rebuffs Iran sanctions;;"By Daniel Dombey, US diplomatic correspondentThere was a flash in Hillary Clinton’s eyes just now as she talked about the issue that is occupying ever more of her time as Secretary of State – Iran’s nuclear programme.Last month the US-led campaign to increase pressure on Tehran took her to Qatar and Saudi. Arabia, where King Abdullah welcomed her with a lavish lunch and watched a few minutes of a football match as he sat beside her wearing a frayed pair of Nike trainers. (Later on he switched his giant television to off-road truck racing.)Iran has also been a constant concern for Clinton during her present swing through Latin America and the position of Brazil, which is currently sitting on the UN Security Council, is particularly important.But so far Brasilia hasn’t budged, arguing that there’s still scope for negotiations with Tehran and that upping the pressure on Iran could prove a risky path of action.Hence the fervent, almost combative tone of Clinton’s remarks when she appeared with Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim.“The door is open for negotiations,” she said of Iran. “We never slammed it shut. But we don’t see anybody, even in the far off distance, walking towards it. We see an Iran that runs to Brazil, an Iran that runs to Turkey, an Iran that runs to China telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions.”Those three countries weren’t chosen at random – the US is also trying – and not yet succeeding – to make the sanctions case to Turkey, which is also on the Security Council, and China, which has a veto on that body. (Lebanon, another current Security Council member, is probably a lost cause for the US on this count.)
At her press conference with Amorim, Clinton argued that Iran would negotiate in good faith only after sanctions were imposed.“Once the international community speaks in unison around a resolution then the Iranians will come and begin to negotiate,” she said. Although that moment of unity clearly hasn’t arrived, US officials say their efforts at persuasion are part of a process that might last for two more months.Clinton markedly reminded her Brazilian hosts that the Europeans and Russians, who like Brazil opposed the 2003 Iraq war, now favoured sanctions on Iran.But Brazil, which argues that sanctions could strengthen Iran’s hardliners and that the dispute could escalate further if they fail, may well believe that being hard to convince is to its advantage.As President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sets out his country’s stall as a regional leader and emerging power, he is also reminding the US that Brazil is no pushover on an issue that numbers among Washington’s top international priorities.So while Mexico – which might have challenged Brazil for its regional role – is focused on in its own drugs-related violence, Lula and Amorim are diving deep into the details of Iran’s nuclear programme. Indeed Lula is off to visit Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad in May, which may make a Brazilian vote for sanctions even harder to obtain before then.US officials say that in their private meetings the Brazilians have allowed themselves some wiggle room by describing Brasilia’s position as “not etched in stone” – indeed, the Americans say that if and when China signs up to sanctions Brazil could soon follow.That may well be the case. But if you had any doubts about Brazil’s independent-mindedness just consider this remark of Amorim’s just after Clinton had spoken about Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez. “Of course I don’t agree with everything the Secretary said,” he commented, before adding that he did think she was right – naturally! – that Brazil was a positive example for other countries."
552;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-03T18:19:32Z;Football goal within Nike’s sight;;Football can become Nike’s biggest money-making sport, overtaking the long-established revenues achieved by basketball and running, the company’s brands president has said.Charlie Denson, in London to launch a range of World Cup shirts made by recycling plastic bottles, said football was in its top three categories, along with basketball and running, and that sales numbers between them were very close.“The assumption is it could definitely be number one. We dominate the basketball category, and our basketball footprint is an aspiration for all the other categories,” said Mr Denson, without giving a timescale.“We will grow faster in our overall business in football, because we don’t own as big a share [of the market]. But basketball as a sport may grow faster than football on a global basis, just because [football] is so omnipresent already.”Nike is sponsoring 10 teams in the World Cup, including Brazil, Portugal and the Netherlands but, as in the 2006 tournament in Germany, it must contend with rival Adidas’ ability to dominate the advertising space ahead of and during the tournament in South Africa this summer as an official Fifa sponsor.In addition, Adidas is sponsoring 12 teams, and providing match balls and kit for match officials. Independent research groups put Adidas as the market share leader in football-related products.It will continue as official sponsor for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.Nike, which in December reported a 4 per cent fall in second-quarter revenues, does not break out sales across sports categories. It purchased UK-based football kit manufacturer Umbro in 2008, and next year begins an eight-year deal with the French Football Federation as the official supplier of the national team, replacing Adidas.“We are in our teenage years as far as the maturity of our brand within the football community,” Mr Denson said.Football is Nike’s number one sport outside the US, and in the middle of the last decade Nike sales internationally overtook US sales. But football was also a big seller in the US.Mr Denson said Nike was comfortable with a strategy of sponsoring World Cup teams rather than the tournament. “[Tournament sponsorships] are very, very large commitments and we’re just not at the point where we’ve engaged in those at that level.”The 13m discarded plastic bottles being used for the recycled World Cup shirts come from landfill sites in Japan and Taiwan, and represents a 30 per cent saving on energy consumption and raw materials.Mr Denson said the new shirts may cost more for Nike to produce, but were financially sustainable because of savings in other parts of the production process. “The consumer won’t be penalised.”
553;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-03-01T22:04:44Z;Business on a sticky wicket;;"On Rakesh Mahajan’s desk in a small office stacked with prototypes of cricket bats and other sporting paraphernalia are two well-thumbed copies of the International Cricket Council rule book. Scored with orange marker pen are paragraphs regulating advertising on cricket bats.Mr Mahajan, the president of the All India Sports Goods Manufacturers Federation, is particularly exercised that Indian cricket players, unlike some of their South African, New Zealand and English counterparts, have invited big international sporting brands such as Nike, Reebok and Adidas to plaster their names freely on their bats for a fee.Naturally, his preference is for local manufacturers’ brands such as his own BDM, or BD Mahajan and Sons, and rival Sareen Sports Industries, or “SS” as it is known locally, to have their moment at the crease in front of the world’s cameras.“They are commercialising the game and removing our brand and our name,” he complains, stabbing at his orange markings.India’s cricket bat makers, alongside global sports companies, are locked in a battle for the country’s consumers, one of the world’s largest markets for their products. In an increasingly brand-aware market, a lot hangs on a name and foreign ones have growing appeal.Cricket, which has undergone a commercial transformation over the past five years thanks to the Indian Premier League, popular short forms of the game and the success of the Indian national team, is booming. Its appeal is highly visible. Across the country, young boys play on improvised mud-baked pitches. Cricket stars are national heroes, used to promote everything on the nation’s television screens from insurance products to whisky.The game’s growing popularity has brought a competitive edge to the workshops of Meerut, a dusty city about 80km east of New Delhi, where cricket bats are handmade for the local and export market. An industrial cluster – producing bats and leather balls, badminton rackets, hockey sticks and tennis nets – is concentrated in two unprepossessing residential-style suburbs of Sports Goods Complex and Suraj Kund sports colony. Willow planks are stacked metres high in the streets to be fashioned into bats by workmen sitting among wood shavings. Others cradle over brass hubs stitching the seams of cricket balls.Among about 1,400 sports goods makers in Meerut, those specialising in cricket supplies such as Sanspareils Greenlands, SS and BDM are some of the biggest names. These cottage industries, some of them supplying the English bat brands of Gray-Nicolls and Gun & Moore and Australia’s Kookaburra, have shrugged off the global economic downturn. BDM’s revenues increased 10 per cent last year. Next door, Nelco, an athletics equipment maker that exports to 57 countries, recovered from a draining family dispute to raise revenues 60 per cent.“After the financial crisis we didn’t have any problems,” says Mr Mahajan. “There was some decrease in exports. But now there is no crisis at all. We really weren’t affected.”India’s sports industry has weathered far worse in its 90-year history. Meerut and Jalandhar, in Punjab, are India’s sports manufacturing capitals, celebrated among industrial policymakers for their low-cost production. Their family businesses were refugees from the upheaval at the end of British rule in India. Before partition in 1947, they were based in Sialkot, a city near Lahore in present day Pakistan. The Hindu craftsmen hurriedly moved south to India. Today, about 30,000 people are employed in manufacturing cricket accessories in Meerut and close to half of their output is exported.Local cricket suppliers have expanded their activities into pads, helmets and clothing. BDM, which employs about 300 people in Meerut, has outlets in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Dubai. Manufacturing operations in the UK and South Africa are under consideration. Of an A to Z of cricket supplies, only its boots are sourced from China.The industry’s success is down to a combination of cheap Indian labour and fine quality English willow. Both are hard to replicate. A month’s labour in Meerut translates to a day’s wage in England, where cricket bats continue to be manufactured. A month’s wages for a craftsman are Rs3,500 ($76, €56, £50).English willow continues to be imported from G.S. Wright in Manchester because it is still considered the benchmark of quality. It has an unparalleled springiness and is favoured by the best cricket players. The price of an English willow bat starts from about Rs12,000. Its Kashmir willow equivalent sells for between Rs300 and 500; while so-called Popular willow bats, suited for children, retail for as little as Rs120.A third factor in the industry’s success is surging demand in India, where the economy is growing 7 per cent a year and incomes are rising. Among a population of 1.2bn, the market is expected to expand considerably as economic opportunity increases.Cricket’s promise has been spotted by others, and not only the biggest sporting brands.Two years ago, Nelco – once called Nelson – diversified beyond its traditional track and field products into cricket accessories. It had already felt the awakening of the domestic market. A decade ago, it exported 80 per cent of its overall production. Today its output is split equally between international and domestic markets.The thinking behind the leap from shotputs, starting blocks and javelins to cricket bats was to establish the Nelco brand, already represented at international athletics championships, in India’s national game. The company now produces 50 bats a day.Varun Anand, Nelco’s UK-educated director, believes that more international brands hold strong appeal in India. “Demand in India is created by supply in the international market,” he says. “People are seeing Nelco in Europe and then want it in India.”So far there are no regrets about moving into cricket supplies.“Cricket is like a monster,” says Ajay Tiwari, Nelco’s production manager. “The cricket market is growing day by day.”Some sports companies in Meerut rely entirely on the domestic market, and not out of choice.Nand Lal used to export his range of baseball bats, hockey sticks and ice hockey sticks. But now the 74-year-old owner of Lal & Sons has fallen back on the domestic market with brands such as Field Marshall, Olympic and Dhyan Chand. His hockey sticks cost Rs100, while his baseball bats sell for less.“We aren’t getting bulk orders anymore, and there’s no longer a foreign buyers market,” says Mr Lal.While wooden cricket bats appear to have a bright future, other sporting lines have not been so fortunate. Mr Lal’s grandson is working in a call centre in Delhi and has little interest in his family’s hockey stick business.The march of time is apparent elsewhere in the cluster. Among the stocks of Kapil Sports are wood-framed squash and tennis rackets, bearing the brands Spalding and Kanwal Sports. Production of these stopped 12 years ago, says Sunil Sharma, Kapil Sports’ managing director, as new graphite technologies overtook racket production.Many of Meerut’s sporting brands will live on supported by an Indian market geared to low prices and indifferent quality. But competition at the higher end is already fierce. In spite of Mr Mahajan’s efforts to promote the BDM brand among India’s cricketers, his counterparts see a future in supplying the bulk orders of bigger sporting brands.“My nephew only wants Reebok, Nike or Puma,” says Mr Anand. “Things are changing. I remember when all anybody [in India] wanted was Action shoes. But that’s gone.”"

Goldman helped the Greek government raise $1bn in off-balance-sheet funding in 2002 using swaps, which the European Union said it knew nothing about until recent days.Any probe by the Fed looking into the use of swaps will likely affect other banks involved in similar activities.Morgan Stanley lost 0.3 per cent to $27.74 after John Mack, chairman, said the bank plans to sell its 34 per cent holding in a Chinese affiliate because the Chinese government refuses to grant the bank permission for a controlling stake.Rival JPMorgan was down 0.5 per cent to $40.64 on its annual investor day.Jamie Dimon, chief executive, is expected to weigh in on some of the current issues facing the banking industry.Heinz, the world’s leading packaged food company, decreased 0.6 per cent to $45.66 after it reported quarterly earnings that narrowly beat estimates, helped by a significant marketing push, strength in emerging markets and new products in the US.Third-quarter sales were up 13 per cent compared with the same period last year.Private equity company Blackstone Group fell by 0.6 per cent to $13.92 in spite of posting fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, helped by improved valuations of its portfolios and better performance fees.Information and record manager Iron Mountain rose 7.1 per cent to $26.02 after the company revised upwards its forecasts for the year following better-than-expected fourth-

555;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;The purpose of business is to win respect;There are signs that banks understand they need to win it back;"Within days of my starting this column on business and society in September 2007, customers were queuing outside Northern Rock to withdraw their savings. This was not cause and effect, I hope.That fateful autumn has led many to rethink the relationship between business and society. Judging by readers’ e-mails, there is a deep unease about the way companies have been run and the role they play in communities.Many readers have asked why banks wandered so far from their mission of taking in savings and making loans. They have pointed to the chief executives who reaped huge personal rewards by agreeing to the takeover of their companies. They have asked why maximising shareholder returns became a near-sacred goal when shareholders’ transience and lack of involvement made the idea that they were the company’s stewards absurd.Underlying these anxieties is a broader question: what is business actually for?To some, the answer is easy: to make a profit. Profits are certainly essential. Without them, businesses cannot survive. Making money is also part of the pleasure of business. There is a buzz that comes with closing a deal and a sense of achievement in beating last year’s numbers. Money matters to individuals too. You can buy things with money: houses, holidays, financial security.But money can’t, as we know, buy you love. Richard Layard and other researchers have also insisted it can’t buy you happiness. Lord Layard argues that while being poor makes you unhappy, once you have a reasonable amount of money, having more makes you no happier.We can go further. The more people earn, they more they seem to want, particularly when others earn more than they do. Hence the frenzied increase in top executive pay and bank bonuses.So what is the purpose of business if not the making of money? Peter Drucker, the great management writer, said it was to serve customers.This is true too. Without satisfied customers, companies cannot survive either. But even that is not enough. Heroin dealers give customers what they want. So do workshops that turn replica guns into real ones and sell them to street gangs. These are effective businesses, in their own way, but not ones you would want your children joining.Abraham Maslow, the American psychologist, set out a hierarchy of five needs. At the bottom was what we needed to survive – oxygen, food and water. Above that was the need to be safe. Once we had those, we could turn to the need for love, affection and a feeling of belonging. After that, we could go for esteem and respect. At the top of the hierarchy was self-actualisation, or self-fulfilment.Where does business fit in? Many people are too busy scrambling for those first two needs – food and safety – to worry about the rest. Feeding the family and keeping a shelter over their heads is enough.After that, we can chase after those other needs. Some are lucky enough to fulfil the highest of Maslow’s needs, self-actualisation, at work. All sorts of people find true fulfilment at work – software developers, recording artists, even auditors. But it is a lot to ask from a job. Others, perhaps most people, hope for work that is reasonably interesting, and indulge their true passions – singing, hiking, wine-tasting – on the weekends.The best businesses are good at providing a sense of belonging. But belonging can be transient. Businesses succumb to competition and disappear. Or technological innovation makes them redundant. No doubt the photographic darkroom was a companionable place to work; so was a travel agency. There is less need for them now.I suspect it is Maslow’s second highest need – respect – that people most crave from work: respect not just from their colleagues but from the world.No one wants to have to cringe when they tell people where they work. When, some years back, I talked to managers at Nike about the anti-sweatshop campaign against the company, they said the most damaging impact was on employee morale. People did not like their friends raising the subject.Banks lost society’s respect. After some self-pitying resentment, there are signs that they understand they need to win it back. Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, wrote last week: “The bond of trust between banks and their stakeholders has been significantly weakened by the events of the last three years …The vital task of rebuilding that trust will be based on banks acknowledging the mistakes that they have made.”It is a start, and it gets us closer to what business is for: making profits and serving customers by doing something we can be proud of.Send your comments to michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/michaelskapinker"
556;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-02-19T17:51:25Z;Tiger Woods confesses amid media frenzy;;Tiger Woods, one of the world’s most bankable sportsmen, confirmed serial infidelities in a carefully staged television apology, but left sponsors, broadcasters and a ravenous press pack guessing about when he might return to competitive golf.Mr Woods was trailed by television helicopters on his way to and from his appearance.Obsessive media interest in Mr Woods’ statement, which was carried live on dozens of US television channels as well as websites from TMZ.com to YouTube, heightened expectations that his eventual return to golf will generate record audiences.His televised apology boosted traffic to ESPN.com and Yahoo, and instantly became the hottest topic on Twitter and Google’s search engine as he admitted: ”I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated.”The Tiger effect was felt even at the New York Stock Exchange, where trading volumes suddenly spiked once he finished speaking.Millions of dollars in endorsement fees, prize money and broadcast rights rest on his eventual return to the PGA Tour, but on this subject he said little. “I will return to golf one day. I just don’t know when that will be,” he said, although he did not rule out a comeback this year.Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, highlighted broadcasters’ hopes for a successful comeback, telling analysts on Thursday: “Being the network with the largest number of golf events, the return of Tiger Woods is a welcome one.”The breach of Mr Woods’ clean-cut image tarnished his brand, but advertising executives have pointed to dramatic comebacks in the past, such as Kate Moss’s renewed commercial success after cocaine allegations rattled her sponsors.The world’s number one golfer offered thanks to the PGA Tour and to “my friends at Accenture,” his largest sponsor before it axed a six-year campaign in December featuring the slogan “Go on. Be a Tiger”.Mr Woods’ statement fell in the middle of this week’s World Match Play Championship, which Accenture is sponsoring. Nike, another long-term sponsor, restated its support for the golfer and said it looked forward to his return.Mr Woods’ net worth was estimated at about $1bn before lurid speculation about his personal life exploded after a small car accident outside his house one night last November.He was by turns penitent and angry as he deprived a ravenous media pack of details of his infidelities, forcefully denied speculation about domestic violence and performance -enhancing drug use and attacked the pursuit of his wife, mother and children by paparazzi, saying: ”Leave my wife and kids alone.”A poised Mr Woods declined to take questions from reporters as he apologised to his family, friends and fans, said he would return to therapy, and ended by hugging his mother.He offered little explanation of his behaviour, but said: “I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn’t have to go far to find them.”
557;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-02-11T18:22:51Z;VF Corp aims to ‘supercharge’ growth in China;;VF Corp, one of the world’s largest clothing companies, plans to significantly expand its franchise store network in China during the coming year, as it pursues the growing appetite for global brands among China’s emerging middle class.The company said on Thursday it plans to open another 400 outlets in China by the year’s end, on top of its existing 1,000-store network, and to step up marketing spending around its North Face outerwear brand, Lee jeans and Vans casual wear.VF has said it wants to “supercharge” growth in China, as it and other global brands seek to establish their position with local consumers.Gap, the US clothing retailer, is planning to open its first store in China later this year, following rivals including Fast Retailing’s Uniqlo, Inditex’s Zara and H&M, who have all rapidly expanded their store networks. China is also now Nike’s largest market after the US.John Anderson, chief executive officer of Levi Strauss, also highlighted the attraction of the new middle class customers in China and India this week, telling a call with analysts that the company was “developing new products for the emerging middle class consumers in markets offering potential for growth, like India and China.”“They really are our growth engine of the future,” he said.Sales in the VF Corp’s comparatively small Asia business - which accounts for around 5 per cent of international sales - have outstripped the recession-hit US and European markets over the past year. The company reported 40 per cent revenue growth in Asia in the fourth quarter, against almost flat revenues of $1.92bn for the business as a whole.VF Corp has said it wants international sales to account for around 40 per cent of its revenues, from 30 per cent in 2009.Eric Wiseman, chief executive officer, said the company’s fourth quarter had been “much stronger than we’d anticipated”, in spite of continued weakness in its Eastern European business, and in sales from its 7 For All Mankind premium jeans business.During the year, VF cut costs by $100m and reduced its inventories by 17 per cent as it responded to the dramatic slump in demand in North America and Europe.In the coming year, the company plans to invest an additional $50m in marketing and other efforts to develop its leading brands, bringing advertising back to levels seen in 2008, but with a focus on its most successful brands.“We are very focused on specific initiatives within our most important and most profitable businesses,” Mr Wiseman said. “We are less democratic with our ad budget this year, we are focused on our biggest and best opportunities, and we are funding those brands at record levels.”He said the company remained interested in additional acquisitions, with a focus on outdoor and action sports brands.VF Corp’s fourth-quarter results were hit by a $114.4m non-cash charge as it wrote off goodwill associated with its acquisitions of Nautica, Lucy and Reef clothing brands. Including the charge, net income was $66.9m, or 60 cents per diluted share, compared with $115.9m of $1.05 per share in the same quarter last year.
558;NKE;Nike Inc;2010-01-27T23:04:40Z;Beijing seen to be tempted to board the Athens express;;It seems a perfectly sensible strategy for Greece to try to woo the Chinese to come to its rescue. After all, the country is struggling to fund its soaring public debt and there are not many alternatives to raise the €55bn ($78bn) or so it will need this year except to go where the money is.Greece managed to raise €8bn this week with a syndicated loan that carried a hefty premium. Its finance minister is about to set off on a road show to raise even more funds in China and the US. By all accounts, the exercise looks like it will be tougher in New York than in Beijing.In the US, the idea is to try to tap hedge funds – but these seem extremely reluctant to engage in what they consider high risk Greek government paper. The Chinese, on the other hand, appear more open to the idea of investing a large amount in Greek sovereign bonds but not on the scale the Athens authorities were originally hoping.Athens needs to raise €26bn in the second quarter of this year alone and would have liked to see the Chinese pick up the lot. That would have sent a signal to the markets that Greece was coping with its fiscal crisis, reviving international confidence in the country’s ability to avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt.It now seems that €26bn is too much even for the Chinese. Instead, the latest suggestions are that Chinese lenders are probably prepared to invest between €8bn to €10bn in a 10-year Greek government bond. But even then it is not likely to be an easy negotiation. For the Chinese are likely to demand a quid pro quo from the Greek government for their intervention.So the question is: what could Greece offer the Chinese in return? It seems Beijing was interested in taking a strategic stake in the National Bank of Greece, the state-owned commercial lender. But this option appears to have been politically difficult for the Greeks to digest.A number of Greek officials and financial experts argue that what the Chinese are likely to want in return for lending billions to help prop up the country’s finances are solid, palpable assets that can help them in their commercial efforts to penetrate more deeply the Balkans and eastern Europe.Greek airline Olympic has been taken over by a local businessman and is no longer a potential candidate. Nor, it seems, is the Greek shipping fleet – because that too would be politically difficult to sell.But that leaves one big asset that could tempt the Chinese – the Greek state railways. True, the railways are loaded with debts and losses. They badly need to be modernised and big investments. And that is exactly what the Chinese could bring.One of Europe’s top railway executives on Wednesday noted that the Chinese were among the best in the world when it came to running and investing in railways. They could soon become one of the most dangerous competitors for European rail companies. They have developed strong knowhow, engineering skills and rolling stock. “They are extremely serious people in this industry and no one should underestimate them,” this executive said.Under the circumstances, the Greek railways could prove a golden opportunity for the Chinese. If Beijing were ultimately to decide to jump on the Athens express, it could well turn out to be a case study in east-west co-operation. Confidence would be restored in Greece, the Chinese would get their highway into the Balkans and elsewhere and the Greek railways would be modernised.Department store woesWhether it was the shirtless models or the signature preppy clothes that they were after, hundreds of shoppers lined up to visit Abercrombie & Fitch’s first Asian store when it opened last month in Tokyo’s Ginza district.Nike’s new store in the hip Harajuku neighbourhood also appears to be doing brisk business while H&M, Uniqlo and other specialist stores continue to generate a buzz that has eluded Japan’s venerable department stores.But in the latest sign department stores are out of favour, Seibu’s trendy department store in Yurakucho, next to Ginza, is to close at the end of the year.The stores that sell 100 goods – as the Japanese word for department store declares – prospered with the rise of the Japanese economy, luring families to do their weekend shopping and office ladies to buy their wardrobe for day and night.But like most sunset businesses, department stores in Japan have failed to keep up with their changing environment.Fashion trends shift more quickly than ever, making it difficult for large operations like department stores to keep up. Half-naked attendants may not be the answer to their woes but Japanese department stores need to come up with something equally sensational to lure consumers away from more exciting pursuits.world.view@ft.com

At his peak, the young striker helped his team win the 1976 Lower Bavarian championship. A passion for sport served Mr Hainer well in his subsequent career at Adidas, pushing the company ahead of local rival Puma to become the second-largest in the industry, behind Nike. Nonetheless, the recession has caused sales to fall – a trend Adidas hopes this year’s World Cup will reverse.How would your PA describe you?
I asked her. She said: “Impatient and focused.”Did you ever think you would end up where you are?
No. But I am grateful that I did.What do you like most about your job?
It enables me to attend the greatest sports events in the world, like Fifa World Cups and Olympic Games – a wonderful treat for a sports fan like myself.And least?
Making decisions that negatively impact other people’s lives – thankfully it does not happen that often.When do you turn off your BlackBerry?
Before I go to bed.What are you reading?
I love crime stories, especially anything written by the Swedish author Henning Mankell and German crime stories featuring Inspector Kluftinger.What’s on your iPod?
I don’t have one. But I enjoy listening to Joe Cocker.What is your guilty pleasure?
Fine wine.What’s the worst job you’ve ever done?
Restructuring the German sales force for Adidas in 1992, which at that time consisted mainly of famous former athletes.What is the smartest business idea you have ever had?
Opening a pub in Lower Bavaria while I was still a student. First because I was able to sell the pub with a profit after a year. But more importantly because that’s where I met my wife.Who has been your biggest influence?
Christian Tourres, who together with Robert Louis-Dreyfus was instrumental in the turnround of the Adidas brand in the 1990s.What is your Golden Rule?
Work hard and be nice to people.When did you last lose your temper at work?
In 2007, going to the Super Bowl in Miami. We ended up with a driver who didn’t know his way round while everybody else seemed to find the stadium easily.Have you ever praised an employee and not meant it?
No. I am a pretty straightforward guy.If you hadn’t been in business, what would you have done?
I would have loved to become a professional football player – but it turned out I wasn’t quite good enough.What is your most hated business expression?
“Think global, act local” – it’s not as simple as that. It is a constant challenge for any global business to find the right balance between the two.Has your job made your personal life suffer?
Yes and no. Yes because of pressure, long hours in the office and lots of business trips. No, because it has opened up opportunities I wouldn’t have had without it.What is the most treasured possession in your office?
The match ball for the final of the 2010 Fifa World Cup – because very few people have seen it yet.When do you want to retire?
Not before 2015 – that’s how long my current contract runs.How do you want to be remembered?

560;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

McMoRan soared 52.3 per cent to $14 while Energy was up 39.9 per cent to $3.68.Arch Coal benefited from an upgrade by analysts at Morgan Stanley, who raised the stock to “overweight”, saying thermal coal inventory could drop faster than expected. Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $27.38.Other energy companies had also gained in early trading but falling oil prices later in the session weighed on both the sector and the wider market.After a final spurt of optimism in the last hour of trading, the S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent higher to a fresh 15-month high of 1,146.98 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 10,663.99. However, the Nasdaq only spent the first 20 minutes in positive territory, finishing the session 0.2 per cent lower at 2,312.41.“Equity markets are torn between the reality of a bustling Asian region and the tepid nature of the domestic recovery, which faces the risk of becoming hampered by labor market weakness,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.“The Chinese data indicates buoyant consumption and bodes well for global trade while US investors don’t seem inclined enough to want to discount more recovery than has already been baked into the cake,” he added.The Vix index, which measures risk aversion and is often described as Wall Street’s “fear” gauge, fell 3 per cent to a 19-month low.Consumer stocks also pulled the market lower on Monday after BMO downgraded the US personal care and household product sector to “market perform” from “outperform”.Analyst Connie Maneaty said many companies in the sector with exposure to Venezuela would suffer from the latest moves by the government to devalue the country’s currency.Venezuelan consumers would be able to buy fewer goods and companies would also suffer from higher translation costs as high-inflation accountancy goes into effect, she said.Shares in Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer products company, dropped 0.4 per cent to $60.20 while Colgate was down 0.4 per cent at $81.15.Elsewhere, UBS raised Talbots to “buy” from “neutral”, saying the women’s clothing chain would be likely to benefit from pent-up consumer demand and higher margins. Shares in the group, which targets women over the age of 35, initially rose but were later down 1.2 per cent to $10.46.However, Tuesday Morning, the clearance furnishing chain, escaped the prevailing pessimism and added to last week’s encouraging retail results.The Texas-based group gave a higher sales forecast for this year after beating quarterly estimates, sending its shares up 32.7 per cent to $4.02.Of the 30 retailers that reported their December sales figures last week, three-quarters beat estimates.SciClone Pharmaceuticals also impressed the market by giving a better outlook than had been expected.The drugmaker said strong international demand had boosted profit. Its shares jumped 9.5 per cent to $2.77.In the financial sector, Citigroup rose 1.1 per cent to $3.63 after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire and the bank’s biggest individual shareholder, said the worst was over for the group following the financial crisis.However, shares in Associated Banc-Corp fell 7 per cent to $11.48 after the Wisconsin-based bank reported a surprise quarterly loss due to rising loan losses. The group also cut its quarterly dividend and announced plans to raise up to $400m through a public offering.
562;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Top football turns focus to digital arena;;The Premier League is seeking to add to its list of sponsors by inviting companies to become an official technology partner in a move it says underlines the competition’s resilience to recession and its international reach.The new category will help the league increase revenue from sponsorship for the next three-year period, beginning next season, and is in keeping with its ability last year to attract increased value from UK broadcast rights despite the tough economic climate.But although the league hopes the new category will attract another international sponsor, it believes growing popularity abroad has not been fully exploited. It has begun a strategic review, to be completed by the end of 2010, aimed at tapping global opportunities more successfully.“There are parts of the world where the Premier League is more popular in percentage terms than in the UK. In many parts of the world we are the preferred league, and we are very interested to know why that is and to ensure that continues,” said Richard Masters, commercial director.Sponsorship makes up about 5 per cent of the Premier League’s £1bn annual turnover, with sponsors including Nike, Lucozade, Wrigley, EA Sports, Topps Merlin and Sporting iD. Last year, Barclays agreed to increase its payment to retain its title sponsorship, signing a three-year deal worth £82.5m.Premier League officials want to capitalise on its growing brand value by exploiting the public appetite in the UK and internationally for football statistics, and using technology that, for example, tracks the performance of individual players.Mr Masters said the league’s future would be built on exploiting the digital arena and its global opportunities. “The kind of sponsors we are going to be attracting are those that can exploit the digital space and those with an international platform,” he said.The new technology category will be the first since the Premier League appointed Budweiser as its official beer partner in 2002.The Premier League has long sought to capitalise on global interest but has until now left it to the 20 individual clubs to strike their own commercial deals.Barclays sponsors a biennial pre-season tour in Asia involving three Premier League teams. But a plan for each club to play an extra fixture abroad was dropped in the face of opposition from the Football Association and some clubs.“We have enjoyed a lot of value from biennial pre-season tournaments but we have to identify other vehicles,” said Mr Masters.The fan base abroad was growing, attracted by the clubs’ ability to fill stadiums and generate a passionate atmosphere, he added.Mr Masters said there were “many different entry points for brands and advertisers to come into the Premier League”, but that league officials would sit down with the clubs after summer to look at sponsorship models.Sponsors were buying into three things, he said: “An association with a great competition, a significant global media platform and the talkability of the Premier League, and the assets to promote their own brand.”The value of the current three-year sponsorship and licensing deals were a 25 per cent improvement on the previous term, said Mr Masters. “We would look to do better than that next [time], at any rate in revenue terms.”
563;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-31T18:55:24Z;AT&T breaks ties with Tiger Woods;;AT&T has dropped its sponsorship of Tiger Woods following weeks of allegations of marital infidelity by the golf star.The US telecommunications group is the latest corporate sponsor to sever ties with the golfer, and joins Accenture, the global consultancy.Other companies have sought to distance themselves from the world’s wealthiest athlete.“We are ending our sponsorship agreement with Tiger Woods and wish him well in the future,” AT&T said on Thursday.AT&T’s logo adorns Mr Woods’s golf bag, but he does not appear in its advertisements. AT&T will continue to sponsor a PGA golf tournament this year.Procter & Gamble is still a sponsor, but has scaled back Gillette advertisements featuring Mr Woods. Tag Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker, is reviewing its endorsement deal with the golfer.Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing business, has remained supportive in recent weeks.Mr Woods’s spate of bad publicity began in late November after a minor car accident outside his home, which exposed a slate of allegations. Shortly afterwards, he said he would take “indefinite” leave from professional golf.Since the negative publicity began, sponsors have pulled advertisements featuring Mr Woods.His departure from golf has cost up to $12bn in stock market value for his nine largest sponsors, according to two economics professors at the University of California. That estimate does not include Mr Woods’s own earnings.Their study tracked eight publicly listed sponsors, which also include Electronic Arts, for 13 trading days from November 27, the date of the car crash, to December 17, a week after Mr Woods announced that he was leaving the sport.Mark Parker, Nike chief executive, said last month the company would “continue to support Tiger and his family as we look forward to his return”, in spite of the fact that he had “chosen to step away from the game” indefinitely.Nike’s golf business, with about $650m in annual sales, has a multimillion-dollar endorsement relationship with Mr Woods, which has included developing a golf shoe, clubs and other equipment.Omar Saad, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note last month Mr Woods’s problems could lead Nike and other groups to reassess the effectiveness of celebrity relationships.
564;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-18T22:11:10Z;Wall Street stages late rally;;Encouraging results from the technology sector lifted stocks on Friday, helping Wall Street pare some of this week’s losses.Shares in Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, climbed 6.4 per cent to $24.34 after it posted a higher profit for the second quarter than had been expected.The company also said it expected the European Union to clear its $7bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, offered further signs that demand for technology is beginning to improve.The Canadian company’s shares jumped 10.3 per cent to $70 after it reported higher sales and gave a more optimistic forecast than analysts had been anticipating.RIM has been aggressively trying to diversify its customer base away from business professionals, taking on rivals such as Apple and Motorola.But Palm limited some of the sector’s gains. The group announced its 10th straight quarterly loss in the second quarter after struggling to keep up with its competitors in the smartphone market. Its shares plunged 13.2 per cent to $10.17.The stronger dollar had pushed stocks into the red before midday but a final flurry of optimism in the last 30 minutes of trading pushed the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent to 1,102.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,328.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent higher at 2,211.69.Volumes also hit an all-time high at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, largely because the session marked the expiration of December options and futures: a convergence known as quadruple witching. The NYSE said many investors were also settling their positions before the holiday period. “A number of positive earnings reports last night, particularly out of the technology sector, appear to be giving sentiment a boost today,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.However, he said indices did not seem ready to break above resistance levels. “With news flow generally expected to drop off dramatically for the next two holiday-shortened weeks, it appears that indices may remain trapped in their current trading channels for some time.”Over the week, the S&P was down 0.4 per cent, the Dow had lost 1.4 per cent but the Nasdaq was 1 per cent higher.Some of the biggest losses came from the financial sector after Citigroup announced plans to pay back government bail-out funds through a stock offering. However, the group ended up selling $17bn of shares at such a low price that the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake.Also weighing on Citi stock this week was Terra Firma, the private equity group, which sued the bank for billions in damages, accusing it of misrepresentation during its disastrous 2007 acquisition of EMI.And Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, filed an arbitration claim against Citi, seeking damages in excess of $4bn. Over the week, Citigroup shares fell 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Stocks suffered further after the Federal Reserve highlighted on Wednesday its intention to shut down some of its liquidity facilities as the economy improves. Some analysts said the market had already begun to price in next year’s expected rate hike.While the consumer staples sector weighed on the market in early trading on Friday, a series of upbeat announcements helped lift investor confidence.Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe maker, forecast a return to revenue growth in the next quarter, lifting its shares 1.9 per cent to $64.42.CarMax, the country’s largest used car dealer, beat estimates for the third quarter. It rose 7 per cent to $23.35. However, the company said conditions still remained tough and it had no current plans to restart expansion.
565;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-18T01:43:54Z;Nike reaffirms its support for Tiger Woods;;Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing business, on Thursday pledged to continue using marketing relationships with leading athletes to build its brands, as it restated its support for Tiger Woods, the troubled golf superstar.Mark Parker, chief executive, said Nike would “continue to support Tiger and his family as we look forward to his return”, in spite of the fact that he had “ chosen to step away from the game” indefinitely.Nike’s golf business, with about $650m in annual sales, has a multimillion dollar endorsement relationship with Mr Woods, which has included developing a golf shoe, clubs and other equipment.Since being involved in a car accident this month outside his home, Mr Woods has publicly acknowledged marital infidelity and announced he was taking a break from professional golf. He has subsequently seen the ending of his endorsement deal with Accenture, the global consultancy, while P&G’s Gillette brand said it was temporarily scaling back its relationship with him.Omar Saad, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note this week that Tiger Woods’ problems could lead to Nike and other companies rethinking the effectiveness of celebrity relationships.“We expect the Tiger media fallout to serve as a catalyst for them both to realise that they are systematically overpaying for athlete and team sponsorships, especially given the growing risks involved,” he wrote of Nike and and its rival Adidas.But Mr Parker said that Nike’s relationships with star athletes “are really critical to developing the insights [that] fuel the product innovation that really distinguishes us in the market place and ultimately the overall business performance of the company”.“This is a strategy that works,” he said, adding that the company continued to assess the economics of sponsorship. “The reality is we participate in an open market …ultimately we make those decisions based on the opportunity we believe we have to drive the strength of the brand, the business and …shareholder value.”Six years ago, Nike maintained its relationship with Kobe Bryant, the US basketball star, when he was the subject of a police investigation into allegations of illegal behaviour that were subsequently dropped.Nike on Thursday reported its second-quarter revenues fell 4 per cent to $4.4bn, while its earnings also fell 4 per cent to $375m, or 76 cents per diluted share, as global demand for its shoes and clothing remained weak. But it reported a 4 per cent increase against the same period last year in future orders for delivery in the coming five months, to $7bn. In the US, its largest market, future orders were down 4 per cent.
566;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-14T22:59:43Z;Tag Heuer to rethink Woods sponsorship;;"Tiger Woods on Monday night looked in danger of losing another sponsor when Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer rowed back from declaring its support for the troubled golfer and said it would review its commercial relationship.Mr Woods, who is taking an indefinite break from golf to sort out his private life, lost the backing of Accenture at the weekend, which said it was terminating its six-year sponsorship.AT&T has said it was evaluating its relationship and Gillette is holding back its marketing of Mr Woods in support of his need for privacy.Tag Heuer, which has been associated with Mr Woods for seven years,
on Monday appeared ready to throw its weight behind the golfer when a spokeswoman told reporters that the company respected what he had achieved in golf and that his personal life was “not our business”.However, this position had shifted by the end of the day. Tag Heuer issued a statement saying: “We respect the privacy of Tiger Woods and his family. In light of recent news, including that Tiger Woods has decided to take an indefinite leave from golf, over the coming weeks we will assess our options with Tiger Woods and IMG [Woods’ agent] regarding our long-term relationship.’’Mr Woods received some respite on Monday when Nike, one of his biggest sponsors, appeared to brush off the allegations of extra-marital affairs that have damaged the golfer’s image. The allegations led to Mr Woods admitting publicly to infidelity.Phil Knight, chairman and co-founder of Nike, said in a sports magazine interview that there was always a risk when companies backed athletes. He told US-based Sports Business Journal that: “Obviously, [Woods] was one we checked out and he came out clean, and I think he’s been really great. When his career is over, you’ll look back on these indiscretions as a minor blip, but the media is making a big deal out of it right now.”The interview was conducted prior to Mr Woods’ announcing a break from the game. Nike said on Friday that Mr Woods and his family had its full support.The golfer has about a dozen big sponsors, including EA Sports and Gatorade. Some estimates puts his overall earnings at about $1bn. Mr Woods has not appeared in public since revelations of his private life surfaced after he crashed his car outside his Florida home more than two weeks ago."
567;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-12T16:57:47Z;Woods to take ‘indefinite’ leave from golf;;Tiger Woods is to take an “indefinite” leave from golf following a week of damaging personal revelations that have tarnished the reputation of the sport’s greatest star.Woods has not made any public appearances since having a minor car accident outside his Florida home at the end of November. However, the incident has triggered a spate of revelations from several women who have alleged affairs with the golfer.Woods is the greatest golfer of his generation and is worth an estimated $1bn thanks to a string of lucrative endorsement deals with companies including Nike, Accenture, AT&T and Gillette.One of Tiger Woods’ major commercial sponsors, Gillette, said on Saturday it would limit the golfer’s role in its marketing programs to help protect his privacy amid the sex scandal surrounding him.“As Tiger takes a break from the public eye, we will support his desire for privacy by limiting his role in our marketing programs,” Gillette said in a statement.Television commercials featuring Woods have been notably absent from the airwaves since the scandal broke although none of his sponsors have yet severed their relationship with the golfer.Woods said in a statement on his website that he was “deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children”.“After much soul searching, I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf. I need to focus my attention on being a better husband, father, and person.”
568;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-07T14:00:17Z;Crunch Christmas for retailers;;"Rising unemployment and weak income expectations have hit the retailer hard this year.Footfall figures in US stores through the important Thanksgiving weekend rose by 13 per cent on last year, but spending fell by 7 per cent as consumers sought out discounts and other bargains.Although internet shopping remains on the rise, will it be enough to make up the shortfall as the busiest shopping period of the year approaches? Where is consumer money going?Mindy Grossman is chief executive of interactive multichannel retailer HSN Inc (HSNi), which recorded this year its strongest Thanksgiving Weekend sales in the company’s history.She was previously in senior management positions with Nike and Polo Jeans, and also sits on the board of the US National Retail Federation.Mindy’s answers to a selection of the best questions are appearing here.———————————————————————————————————————What is the current status in the retail industry telling you about the pace of economic recovery?
Norman Fossett, LondonMindy Grossman: The current status tells us that, although the worst is over, the rebound is not quite robust as was reflected in the recent November comparable store results. It is clear, however, that multi-channel retailers with on-line strength are having greater success.Our positive momentum at HSN indicates that we are gaining share-of-wallet from customers who are responding to our efforts around unique product, value and shopping experiences. We are encouraged by the recent success in the more discretionary categories of jewelry and fashion, which tells us that customers do want to spend yet are being very discreet in their purchases. ———————————————————————————————————————Is heavy discounting of big ticket items during the recession painting a distorted picture of the relatively robust performance of the retail industry during this time?
Bradley Gaines, San FranciscoMG: The tendency of luring shoppers in with what I would call a ”less-for-less” approach, meaning very low prices for lower end technology, is dangerous. The last thing you want to do is disappoint customers when they get a product home, no matter what the price. We have taken the opposite approach this season and applied a philosophy of ”more” – more innovation, more technology, more unique products – but all at a very strong price value – and that has resonated with our customers. We have also been offering great design across our different product categories as we see more and more customers respond to authentic, artisanal design.Retailers who are focused on the long term value of their customers will ultimately have success in the long term.———————————————————————————————————————With margins under pressure during the run up to Christmas, do you expect even deeper discounting in the traditional New Year sales season? What will that mean for the earnings outlook for the start of the new calendar year? What are the comparitives like looking back at 2008?
Ian Hamilton, SussexMG: What is very different this year compared to last year is the state of retail inventories. Retailers have significantly less inventory than last year when the dramatic slowdown in the third quarter resulted in excessive discounting to clear merchandise.This should have a positive impact on margins, although it may suppress sales for certain retailers. In addition, many retailers have been very focused on intrinsic price/value of products in an effort to get the customer to respond without the high level of discounting of the past. Having said that, based on November not being as strong as anticipated in the retail sector, we are now seeing an acceleration of promotions at many retailers. ———————————————————————————————————————Do you believe that e-commerce could be the new engine for growth for the big multichannel retailers in the UK?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineMG: Electronic retail in all its forms will definitely be the new engine for growth, particularly for those retailers who are focused on creating a powerful multi-channel platform. Today, it is not about efforts centered around getting a customer to come to you, it is about the efforts made to access customers on their terms, whenever, wherever and however they choose.———————————————————————————————————————Just as the emergence of large, out-of-town shopping malls sounded the death knell for the high street, will the rise of internet shopping eventually do the same for the mall? Richard Lewis, Des MoinesMG: In the same vein as my earlier commentary, customers want the option of diverse retail experiences. On-line interactive shopping serves the customer well. It is convenient, easy and gives broad access to products and services to customers who can avoid leaving their home.In addition, there is an influx of brands, designers, authorities and celebrities who are broadening their distribution strategy to include on-line and interactive retail in an effort to extend their reach and attract a new audience.Conversely, although I do not believe that the high street will disappear, it will be critical for brick and mortar retailers to create a unique experience that will compel the customer to want to walk into the store. That experience cannot only be about price, it has to be about a sustainable point of differentiation.———————————————————————————————————————Is e-commerce over-reliant on an efficient and reliable postal system? In the UK we’ve recently had a crippling postal strike during which many mail-order companies suffered extreme hardship. How well does the relationship between companies like HSN and the US Postal Service work?
Colin Hughes, DaventryMG: Being able to service the customer effectively on all levels is critical in a direct-to-consumer business. ———————————————————————————————————————Do you think that this peak retail sales season, if disappointing, could finish off some companies? If so, which type of retail operators are most at risk, and which are best positioned?
Andrea Baines, TottenhamMG: This is definitely an era of survival of the fittest. Those retailers who focus on their customer, effectively manage their inventory, provide quality and strong price value and insure a differentiated experience will be best positioned. Retailers who implement risky tactics, such as non-sustainable pricing, lowering quality and/or customer service levels, ineffective inventory management – as well as those who do not invest in innovation for the future – will be the ones who are at risk.———————————————————————————————————————How reliable are measures of footfall, when consumers simply aren’t spending as much?
Dave Taylor, LondonMG: Foot traffic is just one measure. The key indicator is conversion, whether on the high street or on-line. What are you providing that is making the customer spend with you versus a competitor? At HSN, we measure multiple indicators beyond just sales data, such as TV viewership, on-line traffic, session and viewing length on TV and on-line, all in an effort to insure that we are keeping customers engaged.———————————————————————————————————————Apple’s third quarter numbers recently defied predictions that higher-end spending would suffer the most in the downturn. Was the stellar growth in sales an aberration, or the beginnings of the turnaround?
Marcus Greene, MaastrichtMG: Apple’s success is about great product innovation and a relentless focus on giving customers what they both need and want. Again, customers are still spending – they are just more discerning. If you have the right product that services either a functional or an emotional need, it will still perform. We are seeing success in high end products if they are unique. This is true for everything from technology to fashion.———————————————————————————————————————"
569;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-04T18:36:02Z;Woods an asset even with ‘transgressions’;;Accenture’s latest advertising campaign has a picture of Tiger Woods standing on the edge of a stream, club in hand, looking at his ball perched precariously on a rock. “It’s what you do next that counts,” reads the global management consultancy’s strapline.Sponsors of the world’s number one golfer have been asking that question every day since last Friday morning when he drove his Cadillac sports utility vehicle into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his Florida home.The media firestorm that followed the incident, resulting in Mr Woods’ statement on Wednesday apologising to his family for what he called “transgressions” in his private life, is hardly a narrative sponsors had in mind in return for investing about $100m a year in the golf superstar.“The sponsors will definitely be telling him and his people, ‘you have to stop this now, you have to get up front, you have to become pro-active in how you deal with this,’” says Lesa Ukman, founder and chairman of IEG the Chicago-based sponsorship consultancy, who estimates Woods’ total earnings at about $750m.But if there is short-term anxiety among Woods’ commercial backers, publicly at least they were not letting on. One by one, Nike, EA Sports, Gillette, NetJets and Gatorade have put their arm round Mr Woods and declared that their relationship continues.Such wholehearted support comes as little surprise to the sponsorship industry. One reason is that, while Mr Woods and his advisers have built his image around many values, such as his diversity, his connection with young people, his appeal to C-level executives and his well-spoken demeanour, Christian morality is not one of them.“It’s not like it’s a crisis of hypocrisy,” says Ms Ukman. Sponsors may have so-called “morality” clauses tied up in their contracts, allowing them to withdraw if the client’s moral behaviour materially damages their brand reputation, but Ms Ukman does not envisage any of Woods’ sponsors exercising them.David Letterman, the talk show host, has kept his reputation largely intact following his confession in October to affairs with his staff. So too Michael Phelps, eight-times gold medallist at the Beijing Olympics, who admitted to “bad judgment” after being photographed smoking dope .Sponsors will also be mindful of research showing some companies’ brand values suffering after walking away from sportsmen and teams whose performace has declined, while the brands of others being enhanced for sticking with clients in the face of adversity.For Mr Woods’ myriad sponsors, there is the added calculation that he remains at the top of his game, and as long as that continues their returns on investment should continue to be healthy. The industry benchmark for licensing sponsors is about $4 returned for every $1 of investment. For other sponsors, it is about $2.50 to $1.The US PGA Tour, where Woods plies his trade, readily acknowledges the importance of Woods to the game. Ty Votaw, an executive vice-president of the tour, says his commercial value is immense, particularly in his ability to bring the casual sports fan to golf.“There is no question that at events that Tiger plays, interest leves in terms of audience, TV ratings and media coverage spike.“Golf has certainly benefited by the fact that the most recognised athlete in the world plays this sport. You would expect that commercial interest will have increased because of that.”Mr Woods is missing from the greens, having pulled out of this week’s Chevron World Challenge in California, a tournament he hosts. Sponsors will hope that by the time he returns, he will have safely extracted himself from this fiendishly tricky position.
570;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;China outsourcing boomerangs on brands;;The rise of domestic Chinese consumer brands to challenge their famous foreign counterparts has become a defining trend in China’s industrial development. Anyone doubting this need only take a stroll down one of the main streets in Jinjiang, a small city in the southeastern province of Fujian.Along one typical 100m stretch of one street, there are 34 shops all selling different domestic branded products. Laying down the challenge to Nike and Adidas – each of which is thought likely to make around $1bn in China sales this year – there are domestic rivals such as Anta, Tebu, 361, Li Ning, Xingquan, K-Bird, Deerway and Xtep. Taking aim at Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss, Ermenegildo Zegna and others is Septwolves, Lilanz, Hongxing Baihuo, 365+1, Yashi and Cabeen.The names may sound unfamiliar, even outlandish. But the reality is that in a reversal of the natural order of things, the little fish are starting to eat the big fish. The Chinese companies to which western brand holders outsourced their manufacturing a decade or more ago are now successfully rolling out their own branded products. Often, the items that they sell are indistinguishable in terms of quality from those they used to make for the foreign brand emporiums.“It is made mostly of cashmere and a little wool, exactly like an Armani coat,” said one shop assistant pointing out a stylishly cut grey coat in Lilanz, a branded shop run by China Lilang, a local Jinjiang company which raised HK$1.06bn (US$136m) in November through a Hong Kong stockmarket listing.“But you can see from the price tag that it costs a fraction of the price of Armani,” she added. “People won’t see the label, so it will look like you are wearing Armani.”The role that imitation played in corporate development is something that several Jinjiang companies freely own up to. Zhou Shaoxiong, chairman of Septwolves, a Jinjiang company listed on the Shenzhen stockmarket, is quoted by the 21st Century Business Herald as saying that his company first imitated foreign brands, then learned how to innovate itself. Lacoste was an early model but these days when Zhou wanders around shopping malls in Hong Kong, he is more interested in Zara and H&M, the newspaper said.Septwolves is now so successful that it has sired a whole lair of lupine copycats. Shops with names such as Dancing Wolves, Wolf Zone and Temptation of Wolves could be found just meters away from each other on streets in central Jinjiang. At some stage, such young pretenders may start to erode the brand equity of the company that inspired them, but for now Septwolves appears safe. Its sales this year have been doubling compared with 2008, allowing the company to expand its network of stores across the country.Similarly successful are several Jinjiang-based sportswear manufacturers such as Anta, Xtep, Peak and 361 – all of which started out as OEM manufacturers for foreign brands but are now internationally-recognised in their own right and winning market share from Nike and Adidas in China. Their ascent up the value chain accelerated following decisions to sponsor stars in the US National Basketball Association (NBA), which has a huge following in China partly because of the participation of Chinese players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian.Peak and Anta, which are both listed in Hong Kong, sponsor Mr Yao’s teammates at the Houston Rockets, guaranteeing the companies millions of eyeballs when the NBA games are televised in China. Such marketing gambits have helped domestic sportswear brands expand sales rapidly this year in China even as Adidas’ performance has slumped. Adidas’ retail agents closed around 100 stores this year as business migrated to local competitors. Managers are also being lured away. Zhang Jie, general manager of Reebok China, a division of Adidas Group, left to join Anta in late 2008.Having established the competitiveness of their brands versus foreign rivals, Chinese companies have several advantages. One is that they tend to rely less on franchise stores than their foreign counterparts, giving them greater control over quality and brand management. Another advantage is that local brands are generally more nimble in expanding into lower-tier cities, a prime source of revenue this year. This ability to keep up as growth radiates from large conurbations to progressively smaller cities is key for sportswear manufacturers accessing a market in which some 340m people are estimated to take regular exercise.In value terms, China’s sportswear market may grow from an estimated US$7.2bn in 2009 to around US$12.4bn in 2012. Such growth, if it materialises, would be likely to catapult some Chinese sportswear brands into powerful or even dominant positions in the industry worldwide. And this is true not only for sportswear but also for fashion garments and several other consumer industries as well. In Jinjiang, local entrepreneurs are well aware that some 15 years after they typically embarked on their careers by making shoes or clothes or light industrial products in tiny rural shacks, they now occupy positions of global importance.Wang Anbang, president of Susino, one of the world’s largest umbrella makers, plans to open several hundred branded stores nationwide over the next year to change his business from merely making umbrellas to selling branded fashion accessories. Susino will aim first at the domestic market, and then seek to build its brand overseas by forging partnerships with suitable foreign companies. Mr Wang is also keeping his eye open for suitable foreign acquisitions.“It is no problem for us to make an acquisition overseas. China’s capital markets have loads of money. It is easy for us to buy,” he said. However, the focus would be on learning about overseas markets, fashions and consumer trends rather than charging ahead with acquisitions, Mr Wang said.james.kynge@ft.com
571;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-12-02T20:47:06Z;Woods sponsors take the long view;;Many of Tiger Woods’s sponsors made clear they intended to stick with the world number one golfer in the wake of his public apology to his family on Wednesday for “transgressions” in his private life.Mr Woods is the world’s highest earning sportsman and his sponsorship deals are estimated to be worth $100m a year. His clean-cut reputation has been tarnished since he crashed his Cadillac into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home in the early hours of last Friday.Speculation about his private life led Mr Woods to issue a statement on his website on Wednesday. He had “not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves”, he said.“I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind closed doors with my family.”Mr Woods, winner of 14 majors and $93m in prize money, has 13 official sponsors. Sponsorship experts say his brand value is “irreplaceable” and many of those sponsors appeared willing to forgive his imperfections.Gillette, the Procter & Gamble personal care business, said it did not comment on the private lives of its “ambassadors”, but added: “Like each of us, they are human. And like each of us, they make mistakes.“By acknowledging and learning from their mistakes, we hope they will become even better, both in the game and beyond.”Nike, the sporting goods manufacturer, said its relationship with the golfer “remains unchanged”, the same phrase used by EA Sports, the video games maker. Gatorade, the manufacturer of sports drinks, offered its support to Mr Woods and his family, saying: “Our partnership continues.”NetJets, the business aviation company, repeated a statement made this week by David Sokol, its chief executive, that it was “proud” to be involved with the golfer.AT&T declined to comment.Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association, which represents commercial sponsors, said Mr Woods’s crown had “slightly slipped” but he was too valuable a property for sponsors to desert.Nigel Currie of the agency BrandRapport said the stature of Mr Woods, and the fact that he was likely to remain at the pinnacle of golf for some years, would help him weather the storm of media attention.“He is irreplaceable,” Mr Currie said. “This is the sort of thing that time will heal, but it is going to cause a change of direction.”According to Philip Stinson, media and entertainment lawyer at Clintons, US sponsors favour “morality” clauses in contracts, which enable them to terminate agreements if a sportsman’s behaviour materially damages the sponsor’s reputation.“The grey area is in defining behaviour which isn’t imprisonable but is arguably morally suspect and whether it can reasonably be said that the behaviour has had any material negative impact on the good name and image of the sponsor,” Mr Stinson said.
572;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-11-30T23:01:09Z;Industrial groups warn over US climate law;;Industrial companies operating in the US are warning that they will face a heavy regulatory burden should US Congress fail to pass climate change legislation.The companies fear that without legislation, the US Environmental Protection Agency would impose its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions or states would introduce different carbon pollution regimes.Peter Molinaro, head of government affairs at Dow Chemical, the largest US chemicals group, told the Financial Times that the proliferation of such initiatives would present “an enormous administrative burden” for companies that operate across different regimes.“Manufacturers are having enough trouble in this country competing with foreign companies,” Mr Molinaro said. “We’d be adding administrative and cost burden where we shouldn’t.”Alison Taylor, vice-president of sustainability for the Americas at Siemens, the German engineering group, said businesses needed to know the price of carbon for planning reasons. “How do you have one price of carbon if you’ve got four or five different regimes?” she said.President Barack Obama had hoped that Congress would pass cap-and-trade legislation before next week’s United Nations Climate Change conference in Copenhagen.However, the focus on healthcare and the economy means he will arrive in Denmark empty-handed.Nevertheless, Mr Obama is expected to pledge that the US will cut carbon emissions.A climate bill was squeezed through the House of Representatives in June, but a bipartisan proposal that could be presented in the Senate as soon as this week faces an uphill battle.“The chances of getting a bill passed continue to be very uncertain,” said David Brown, head of federal affairs at Exelon, the biggest operator of nuclear power plants in the US.That raises the prospect that US states or regions could initiate their own mandatory regimes or that the Environmental Protection Agency could impose greenhouse-gas emissions limits.The US already has one mandatory regional cap-and-trade programme in the form of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which includes 10 north-eastern states.Without federal legislation, similar schemes are likely to spring up elsewhere.California last week announced a plan for its own cap-and-trade system.The climate change issue has split the business world.Trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, and big energy groups such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron oppose the climate bill that passed the House, saying it will kill off US manufacturing jobs.That stance has alienated companies that support the measure.Nike and Apple are among the businesses that have withdrawn from the US Chamber of Commerce over its stance on the issue.
573;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-11-09T14:04:16Z;Former Chelsea chief joins CAA Sports;;Peter Kenyon, former chief executive of Chelsea Football Club, has joined Creative Artists Agency, the Hollywood talent group that represents Steven Spielberg and George Clooney, to oversee its international sports division.Mr Kenyon recently left Chelsea, where he was hired by Roman Abramovich to run the football club following the Russian billionaire’s investment in the west London team. Before then he was chief executive of Manchester United.CAA created CAA Sports three years ago and it has quickly become one of the biggest sports agencies in the US with more than 500 athletes and coaches on its books. It represents a range of stars, including basketball’s LeBron James, Peyton Manning of the NFL and Andy Murray, the tennis player.The company plans to expand internationally and football is seen as the ideal sport to tackle first because of its global popularity. CAA’s roster of football stars includes David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Fredrik Ljungberg, as well as former Chelsea coach José Mourinho.Mr Kenyon will be based in London, where he will cover several sports, although he will initially draw on his experience in football. “After 14 years running the two most successful clubs, I decided that I wanted to move on,” he told the Financial Times.He added that the sports division’s growth in a “competitive marketplace” was “remarkable”.Howard Nuchow, the co-head of CAA Sports, said the agency wanted to draw on Mr Kenyon’s marketing and brand expertise. “We didn’t look at him as the president of a soccer club . . . he’s been brand-building for a long time.”Mr Kenyon used to work for Umbro, the sports apparel group, where he redirected the company to focus on football and moved manufacturing to China. His time with Chelsea and Manchester United coincided with an explosion in the value of football media rights and the arrival of a new generation of investors and club owners.He also had a hand in some of the sport’s top commercial deals, striking a $303m kit contract with Nikeat Manchester United and a similar contract at Chelsea with Samsung.

However, Nike accused the chamber of “extreme rhetoric and obstructionist tactics” on global warming in a recent letter.Disney has elected to stay within the chamber but has ramped up its climate change efforts to meet environmental targets recently set by the company.The group said its forestry project would supplement its efforts to combat climate change by reducing use of fossil fuels and switching to cleaner forms of energy.“It’s essential to take swift action to preserve our most vulnerable natural environments for future generations and to be innovative in achieving that goal,” said Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive.Most of the Disney funding will go towards financing community management of the forests within the project areas and extanding sustainable practices among local villages. The project areas are located in the Congo Basin and the Amazon.“As climate talks gain momentum in the US and abroad, Disney’s leadership points the way to the key role tropical forest conservation must play in emerging climate change policies,” said Peter Seligmann, chief executive of Conservation International.The media company, operator of a film studio, television channels and an international network of theme parks, has promised to slash the amount of waste it produces by 50 per cent in the next three years.Disney’s parks produced 290,000 tonnes of waste in 2006 but the group said recently that that it would cut by 50 per cent the amount of solid waste destined for landfill sites.Other US companies have also become more active in forestry protection.Marriott International, the hotel operator, last year signed a deal with the Brazilian state of Amazonas that saw the group launch a carbon offset programme for its guests. It has also invested in a fund aimed at securing 1.4m acres of rainforest.News Corporation recently said it had become “carbon neutral”, while PwC, Marks and Spencer, Reckitt Benckiser and Yahoo have all pledged to offset their emissions.
575;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-10-08T17:11:48Z;Headhunter finds green sprouts, not shoots;;"The shape of the current recession has been described in many ways – a double-dipping W with more pain to come or a V-style recovery, with the rise as steep as the fall.But Gary Burnison, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Korn/Ferry, the world’s largest headhunter by revenue, says it will be a Nike-shaped “swoosh” – a gradual return to health following last year’s hurtle down a “double black-diamond ski slope”.There are signs of an uptick already. The financial services sector, which led the world into the downturn, could lead the way out, according to Mr Burnison. Just last week, he received a mandate to look for 1,000 private bankers to fill roles in Latin America.But, like recruiters everywhere, Mr Burnison remains reluctant to call the end of the recession. It is “green sprouts”, not shoots, he says, and “it’s as hard as it has been in the past 10 months to get a net new hire”.The slide in employment last year hit Korn/Ferry, which has 80 offices in 40 countries, as hard as it did recruiters everywhere, with the company losing £500m ($800m) worth of new business almost overnight. Job losses followed, with headcount falling at the company by as much as 30 per cent in the past year as it strove to save cash.But in spite of the rout, Korn/Ferry managed to keep itself in the limelight by making several high-profile appointments – including William Dudley, chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Ben Verwaayen as CEO at Alcatel Lucent, and Bruce Van Saun, chief financial officer at Royal Bank of Scotland.In Britain, the company has recently bought the famously discreet Whitehead Mann partnership, which has handled key positions for the Financial Services Authority, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland.Whitehead Mann is typically described as a “Saville Row” type brand, after the upmarket shopping street in London – and the hope is that the new Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann in the UK will help the company expand in what is arguably its second-biggest market. Mr Burnison argues that the recession provides opportunities for recruiters and clients alike.“Companies make their best moves in these markets; if you have significant economic tailwinds it’s very hard to change. This is much more exciting,” he says.To this end there have been new hirings at Korn/Ferry even as there have been firings and Mr Burnison readily admits that many of his clients have used the recession to cull less productive workers and upgrade staff.“Despite what people say about organisations cancelling weaker staff, they don’t normally because people don’t like to have those difficult conversations – whether in the family, at work, or wherever.”While the recession has not necessarily made the business of making redundancies easy, the sheer scale of job losses has provided an emotional shield to both employers and those set for the chop.Nevertheless, sacking a father-of-three recently remains one of the hardest tasks faced by Mr Burnison. “There he was, a grown individual with three kids, in my office and he broke down and cried. These things are not pleasant to do.”"
576;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-10-07T22:32:45Z;Asian shoe test for EU trade commissioner;;Global footwear producers and leading European retailers have condemned plans to extend anti-dumping duties on European Union imports of Chinese and Vietnamese shoes by at least 15 months.“Prices have increased by on average at least 10 per cent since the imposition of the duties in 2006,” the European Footwear Alliance, representing manufacturers such as Nike, Adidas and Timberland, said in a statement.“EFA members have paid €800m ($1.18bn, £738m) in anti-dumping duties in the last three-and-a-half years and we fail to understand who has benefited.”The recommendation by Baroness Ashton, Europe’s trade commissioner, marks a key turn in one of the most contentious trade disputes to come before the European Commission in years. It will touch off a frantic round of debate between the Commission, member states and the footwear industry before a final decision, expected next month.The baroness was swayed by findings that the duties, first imposed in 2006 by her predecessor, Lord Mandelson, had helped to stabilise market share for ailing European footwear makers, according to a person familiar with the investigation,The Commission concluded the duties had had little impact on consumers, pushing up average shoe prices by €1.50. The duties amount to 16.5 per cent for Chinese footwear and 10 per cent for those from Vietnam. The decision to extend the duties or allow them to lapse is the most fraught of Lady Ashton’s short tenure, and is expected to bear on whether or not she is reappointed to the next Commission.The 2006 decision proved divisive among the 27-member EU and its €12bn -a-year leather processing industry. Wednesday’s recommendation pits tariff advocates, who say the duties have helped to stabilise the market share of European producers while pushing up consumer prices only slightly, against big retailers and brands such as Clarks and Adidas, who say Europeans do not want the low-paid work of making shoes and they must make them elsewhere to stay competitive.It could also add further tension to the EU’s trade relations with China.The 15-month term suggested by Lady Ashton would in effect cover two seasons of shoe imports, based on the industry’s ordering schedule.The Commission has sought to play down the political dimensions of the case, arguing that its freedom to act is limited by trade law. It has rejected comparisons of the case to the US decision to impose duties on Chinese tyres.European producers’ share of the EU market fell from 65 per cent to 40 per cent between 2001 and 2005, mostly because of inroads by China and Vietnam, according to EU statistics.Free-trade advocates say an extension could invite accusations that the EU practises the protectionism it complains about elsewhere.Many trade experts were uneasy on learning that Lady Ashton, then leader of the House of Lords, had been nominated to replace Lord Mandelson. They felt she lacked his expertise, but the consensus now is that she has done well in a dismal trade environment in which the EU has generally avoided a slide into protectionism.

The ADP National Employment Report showed that employers in the private sector cut 254,000 jobs from payrolls in September after cutting a revised 277,000 jobs in August. Analysts expected a reduction of 200,000 jobs.Investors were nervously awaiting Friday’s report on the unemployment rate.The S&P 500 eventually closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,057.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 9,712.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1 per cent to 2,122.42. But Wall Street still recorded its seventh straight monthly gain and has risen about 15 per cent over the last quarter. The Dow also notched up it biggest quarterly rise since the fourth quarter of 1998.“Watching today’s trading in equity markets reminds me of watching a marathon runner heading for a finish line with no energy left, aiming just to finish the race,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC markets. “With the third quarter ending today, it appears in some ways that equities are continuing to mark time before quarter end and the big data points due later this week.”Industrial stocks led the market lower throughout the day on fears about the pace of economic recovery. Alcoa dropped 1.4 per cent to $13.12 and United States Steel lost
2.6 per cent to $44.37.American Superconductor rose 10.5 per cent to $33.54 after the company said late on Tuesday that it had signed a contract with China’s Sinovel Wind to provide electrical components for use in wind turbines.Jabil Circuit, the electronics maker, posted better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, mainly due to cost cuts.The company has said it expects to cut about 4,500 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Its shares gained 9.2 per cent to $13.41.Financial stocks also dragged the market lower. CIT Group fell 45 per cent to $1.21 after reports that the group was nearing a plan that would be likely to hand the commercial lender over to its bondholders.CIT, which specialises in lending to retailers and other middle-market companies, is said to be preparing an exchange offer that would eliminate up to
40 per cent of its more than $30bn in outstanding debt.Bank of America lost 1.4 per cent to $16.92 after announcing a deal to sell a long-term asset management business, which makes up its Columbia Management division, to Ameriprise Financial for about $1bn. Ameriprise rose 12.3 per cent to $36.33.However, Nike, the largest athletic shoemaker, helped lift the market from the opening bell.Late on Tuesday, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings after cost cuts offset declining revenues in key markets such as the US and China. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $64.70.Darden Restaurants, which owns the Red Lobster chain, also beat analyst estimates when it reported its first-quarter earnings. However, its shares fell 5.6 per cent to $34.13 after
the group’s forecast disappointed analysts.Saks fell 4.9 per cent to $6.82 after the luxury department store chain said it would offer as much as $100m in shares.In a regulatory filing posted late on Tuesday, the group said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt.Discovery Laboratories struck an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration over its experimental lung drug, sending the company’s shares

578;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Crocs chief snaps back at critics;;The chief executive of Crocs, the US-based footwear company, was always going to need a thick skin when he took control of the group.John Duerden, who took over six months ago, admitted he had never worn the clogs before taking the job and that his family were less than impressed by the brand.“My 14-year-old daughter said to me when I took the post, ‘If you ever wear Crocs …’, but I noticed that she snuck on a pair this summer,” he said.He added that he was surprised by the strong feelings the shoes aroused. Facing the prospect of reinvigorating a brand that has triggered websites such as ihatecrocs.com, Mr Duerden said: “I’ve never seen a brand that is so polarised between people who love it and people who hate it. But I think that there are a lot of closet Crocs wearers out there, who are bursting to wear the shoes.”However, times – and fashion – have been hard on the group, whose brightly coloured clogs lost popularity just as quickly as they became an overnight international hit.And Mr Duerden told the FT that the company, which has slashed 32 per cent of its workforce since the end of 2007, may cut more jobs as it tries to stem losses and move back to profitability.“We have to bring costs down in line with revenues,” Mr Duerden said. “Although I am hoping we are through the majority of the cuts, I can’t say that for certain.”A person close to the company added: “You can read into that, that it is going to lead to future redundancies but there are no targets for how many.”But the company said overall headcount might increase in the long term as it continues a major push into retail worldwide.The company first swung to a loss in May last year, as sales dropped, hit both by declining popularity and the general consumer downturn, which left it with huge amounts of unsold stock. Its losses reached $30m last quarter, although analysts had predicted worse, in a sign of how far the company has fallen from nearly $25m in net profit in 2007.The company has already shelved certain lines, including its clothing brand and You, the upmarket brand of women’s shoes, as it tries to refocus the brand on its core offerings.Mr Duerden said he had no immediate plans to bring those lines back and instead would focus on keeping existing customers. He admitted the shoes were unlikely to impress ‘fashionistas’ but said: “We want to drive the brand at people who choose to be happy, rather than right.”Mr Duerden, 68, joined the company last year from his Chrysalis consulting group, which aimed at turning round struggling brands. He previously led efforts to turn Reebok into a competitor to Nike, but said Crocs represented “one of the toughest turnrounds” of his career.The company has sold roughly 20m pairs of shoes this year across 125 countries, showing demand remains. Mr Duerden said his long-term aim was to capitalise on that strength and turn it into the $1bn-valued company it hoped for as recently as last year.
579;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-08-10T16:48:27Z;Puma hunts sales in Africa ahead of World Cup;;Next year’s football World Cup will be the first staged in Africa, but for Puma and its chief executive, it feels like coming home.Jochen Zeitz, Puma’s chief executive, says the continent’s leading football brand aims to significantly step up sales, production and sourcing in Africa in the coming years.“The soccer championship in South Africa will be a home match for us. Nobody has such a deep understanding of the African market as we have,” Mr Zeitz told the Financial Times.In the past year, the continent accounted for about 3 per cent of Puma’s €2.5bn ($3.5bn) revenues. But sales of footballs, shoes and apparel have doubled every two years in Africa, and Mr Zeitz says Puma’s revenues on the continent, with its almost 1bn inhabitants, would continue to grow faster than elsewhere.Puma, which is trying to make up lost ground on rivals Adidas and Nike on a global scale, might not have as swollen a marketing budget for the World Cup as these competitors. But it sponsors 11 African teams as well as Samuel Eto’o, Cameroon’s football star.Mr Zeitz, whose private passion for Africa – he owns a farm in Kenya – interplays well with Puma’s ambitions there, says the world’s third largest sporting goods company aims to step up production in Africa to more than one million pieces in 2010, after 750,000 pieces this year.Puma is a supporter of the “Cotton made in Africa” initiative, which aims to improve the living conditions of African cotton farmers.It wants to increase the amount of cotton sourced in Africa from 3 per cent to a high two-digit percentage in coming years. The sporting goods industry is eagerly awaiting next year’s South Africa football World Cup, as this year has lacked large revenue-boosting sporting events.Adidas has forecast a new football revenue record for 2010, but Mr Zeitz is wary of raising the bar too high for next year’s event.“It can bring a positive impulse, but it cannot compensate for the weak world economy,” Mr Zeitz warns.All sporting goods makers are grappling with the effects of the global economic crisis, currency volatilities and higher sourcing costs.Puma’s profit shrank to almost zero in the first quarter, as it launched a €110m restructuring programme. But its profit rebounded to €63m – a slight year-on-year increase – in the second quarter and revenues increased by 4 per cent to €600m.Analysts say Puma, which is majority-owned by PPR, the French retail conglomerate and luxury group, weathers the downturn much better than its rivals.“Puma uses a ‘lost year’ for the sporting goods industry to streamline the cost base despite profitability not suffering materially,” says Christoph Dolleschal, analyst at Commerzbank.“Adidas in contrast was forced to kick off the restructuring due to various problem areas that led to a severe decline in profit,” he adds.Mr Zeitz says he reacted proactively because “you always have to have one restructuring in your coffer”. The restructuring programme will be fully implemented by year-end and will lead to future savings of €150m a year.“After 14 years of growth, the company is in a phase of consolidation,” says Mr Zeitz, who after 16 years at the helm of Puma is one of corporate Germany’s longest-standing chief executives – even though he is only 46 years old.This year, Puma launched an assortment of sailing clothes, attacking a different breed of competitors such as Helly Hansen and North Face.As a way to gain brand recognition, Puma spent an estimated €20m on sponsorship for this year’s Volvo Ocean Race, one of the hardest sailing races in the world.Mr Zeitz estimates Puma’s outdoor segment will reap two-digit million euro revenues this year, but says it will expand rapidly.“In the long run, we aim for three-digit million euro revenues,” he says.For the moment, Puma will concentrate on sailing wear. But Mr Zeitz says a launch of hiking apparel could be an option for the future.“Pumas do live in the mountains as well, so I can not exclude this for the future,” he says smilingly.

No deal had been signed by Thursday afternoon in New York and an agreement was probably days away, they said.Although the Publicis bid, expected to value Razorfish at about $600m, is slightly below the headline price offered by Dentsu, it has also offered to place advertising valued at hundreds of millions of dollars across Microsoft’s digital properties in the coming years.Dentsu’s more limited media buying reach outside Japan is thought to have restricted its ability to match these terms. Microsoft demanded an ongoing commitment from bidders since it was likely to record a big loss on the sale.Microsoft took control of the digital agency as part of its $6bn acquisition of aQuantive in 2007.Razorfish is among the more prominent online specialists, with 2,000 employees and Nike and Audi among its clients.But Microsoft was more interested in the technology divisions of aQuantive, which help determine the most effective places to put adverts online.Microsoft has regarded itself as a platform for outside advertising agencies, rather than a rival. The strategic need to sell Razorfish may have taken on more urgency with Microsoft’s effort to strike an alliance with Yahoo in search-based advertising.Publicis and Microsoft would not comment.
581;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-08-01T01:58:00Z;Reviving Wagner’s legacy;;Change is in the air at the annual Bayreuth festival in Germany – and for the first time in half a century, the Wagner family is managing it harmoniously. Making their debut in front of the world’s cultural press last weekend, the new joint festival directors, Katharina Wagner and Eva Wagner-Pasquier, appeared relaxed together. After two generations of family feuding, the half-sisters have signalled a fresh start.That marks a change in style from their father, Wolfgang Wagner, whose long reign as festival director, until his retirement last year, was increasingly marked by authoritarianism and artistic stagnation. But do Katharina, 31, and Eva, 64, have the vision to reclaim Bayreuth’s position in the vanguard of Wagner interpretation?For the German cultural establishment, as much as the local and national funding bodies that bankroll Bayreuth, the succession debate was more than a beauty contest between members of the Wagner family. It was about the need to reinterpret Richard Wagner’s ideals in a 21st-century context. His injunction “Kinder, schafft Neues” (Children, make something new) is often quoted, but Katharina and Eva have shown little enthusiasm for discussing its relevance today.Some commentators, led by Nike Wagner (another of the composer’s great-granddaughters), say the festival has become lazy: buoyed by the overwhelming demand for tickets, it has turned itself into a well-oiled commercial machine. Nike wants the festival to range wider than the 10 Wagner operas canonised by Cosima, the composer’s widow, and advocates a programme embracing Wagner’s unsuccessful early works, composers that influenced him and contemporary works that draw on his spirit.That may be a step too far for most Bayreuth-watchers, but few deny the need for modernisation. The joint directorship is a compromise. The Richard Wagner Foundation, dominated by public funding bodies, had no intention of handing one of Germany’s cultural jewels to someone as inexperienced as Katharina – especially after her over-the-top 2007 production of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, revived at this year’s festival, which includes full-frontal nudity and portraits of German cultural icons brandishing plastic phalluses. Yet although Eva, formerly a casting director for leading opera houses, brings maturity, international experience and the goodwill of Bavaria’s cultural bigwigs, she has no independent artistic profile.Katharina is Eva’s polar opposite. She is young, media-savvy, ambitious, super-confident, with an apparent imperviousness to criticism: taking a solo bow to a wall of boos after Meistersinger last Sunday, she beamed. Katharina enjoys striking provocative poses and is not slow to trade on the Wagner name. She has already raised the festival’s internet profile and launched marketing initiatives that include a children’s version of Der fliegende Holländer and a series of big-screen relays from the festival theatre. She has also pledged to open up the Wagner family’s long-secret wartime archives, detailing contacts with Hitler.Katharina and Eva’s differences in age and personality could work to their advantage. Already they are focusing on a new generation of interpreters – notably the conductor Thomas Hengelbrock, an early music authority who promises a new edition of Tannhäuser for 2011, based on his study of Wagner’s rehearsal and piano scores from Paris and Dresden. Kiril Petrenko will conduct a new Ring for the composer’s bicentenary in 2013. Katharina will stage Tristan und Isolde in 2015, and there is talk of featuring Wagner’s early works on the festival fringe.While none of these plans signifies a radical change of direction, they offer grounds for hope. But one change has already taken place that could have far-reaching consequences. With Wolfgang’s retirement the Wagner family’s legal title to the festival came to an end. The new joint directors have seven-year contracts and are employees of the state. This opens the way for a non-Wagner to take command of the festival theatre. It has already led to the unionisation of the workforce, who previously submitted to Wolfgang’s will, at lower-than-market rates of pay.Like it or not, something new is being made of Wagner’s Bayreuth legacy. Whether his “children” remain in control will depend on how Katharina and Eva fare over the next six years.www.bayreuther-festspiele.de
582;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Mixing morals and money;;"To judge from his encyclical Caritas in Veritate, published this week, Pope Benedict XVI agrees with those who say that something has gone wrong with the way the world does business. What makes his document unusually disturbing and thought-provoking is an assumption he does not share. The Pope does not think that making capitalism more moral will be a simple matter of bringing a few malefactors to account, whether this involves summoning a half-dozen bankers to hearings in Westminster or Washington, or chanting slogans against Bernard Madoff in Manhattan’s streets. “Many people today would claim that they owe nothing to anyone, except to themselves,” the Pope writes. “They are concerned only with their rights.” That certainly describes a lot of businessmen – and most of the rest of us.Caritas in Veritate must have disappointed many people who had really been looking forward to it. Surely the leader of a faith with universal claims would not devote tens of thousands of words to globalisation if he did not mean to excoriate it. Yet Benedict has bigger fish to fry than Wal-Mart, say, or Nike. The encyclical is not anti-global or anti-capitalist. In fact, it accepts that “man is constitutionally oriented towards being more” – richer, yes, but also wiser and more loving. Business and finance have not created new excesses. They have opened new routes for an arrogance already present in the hearts of men.The Pope, in perhaps his most radical passage, laments the “hegemony of the binary model of market-plus-state”. By this he means technocracy. Business and government have become specialised fields; each follows a logic that dispenses with the insights of religion. Globalisation can break down cultures, and with them the moral systems in light of which it can be judged. “If globalisation is viewed from a deterministic standpoint, the criteria with which to evaluate and direct it are lost,” the Pope writes. Certain cynics and idealists might agree that is precisely globalisation’s point. The teachings of the church can find no foothold in a totally free market.Unfortunately, one of the lost insights concerns justice. The Pope would like us to think about justice as having three aspects. There is commutative justice (the idea of properly judging the prices of things), distributive justice and social justice. National governments, which used to address the second and third, no longer have full power to do so. The global institutions that have replaced them tend to be concerned only with commutative justice – and they do a bad job, the Pope thinks, of judging the value of labour. “If the market is governed solely by the principle of the equivalence in value of exchanged goods, it cannot produce the social cohesion that it requires,” he writes.It is on the subject of justice that the Pope gives voice to a striking insight: “In the global era, the economy is influenced by competitive models tied to cultures that differ greatly among themselves. The different forms of economic enterprise to which they give rise find their main point of encounter in commutative justice.”The marketplace is a narrow meeting place – the point of “encounter” is on the basis of a lowest common denominator. The only part of our culture that retains its value is that part that can be made intelligible to people we trade with. Most of what is distinctive and valuable about the cultures of trading partners gets left out. If this is true, then to the extent our lives are commercialised, we don’t live in an extended version of our culture but in a shrunken version of it. The idea that globalisation expands our horizons is an optical illusion. The same holds true of our technological gadgets. They may give us more instruments for communicating, the Pope says. But “it does not follow that they promote freedom or internationalise development and democracy for all”.The Pope is optimistic that globalisation does not make loss of identities inevitable. One hopes he is right. But as soon as he addresses practical matters, he faces a series of Hobson’s choices. The Pope wants more worker protections and an equitable distribution of energy resources. But he has no more luck than others have had in figuring out how to produce distributive justice in this day and age. Development of poor countries may require open markets, which may weaken social protections in the rich ones. Our choice may be between exacerbating national inequality and exacerbating global inequality.The Pope’s surprisingly firm political recommendation is for increased global government, based on existing institutions. He urges a “reform of the United Nations and likewise of economic institutions and international finance, so that the concept of the family of nations can acquire real teeth”. But this begs the very question that his encyclical is meant to address. Before such institutions can be legitimately constituted, we need to know what their principles are.A curious thing about this encyclical is that its theological and moral arguments are more pragmatic than its supposedly “pragmatic” ones. The Pope has discarded our broken ideological categories and looked more directly at the problems they purport to address. Benedict is certainly right to say that, if we wish to protect the environment, “the decisive issue is the overall moral tenor of society”. He is right to attack the presumption of technologically advanced societies that “confuse their own technological development with a presumed cultural superiority”. And he makes a convincing case that the recent financial failures are best understood in the context of a wider moral failure.The writer is a senior editor at the Weekly StandardMore columns at www.ft.com/christophercaldwell"
583;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-07-08T21:43:53Z;Children of the credit revolution;;Andy Slater, a 22-year-old delivery driver in London, appears oblivious to the fact that the UK is suffering its worst recession since the second world war.“You gotta have new trainers ain’t you? Nike, Adidas, Lacoste – whatever looks good,” he says, eyeing up the latest models in the Westfield shopping mall in west London.He is not alone in his opinion. In a survey conducted by the US-based Westfield group in May, 70 per cent of its shoppers aged between 18 and 35 said they were spending the same or more on clothes and eating out.Slaves to fashion and free of most financial commitments, young people have kept spending in economic downturns when others have cut back. But today’s younger generation is particularly flush with cash and, after growing up during the credit boom, spending is deeply ingrained.As a result, retailers geared towards the youth market – particularly clothing chains – have been basking in their good fortune.Fashion retailers JD Sports, New Look and Primark all reported double-digit sales growth this year and the internet-based Asos doubled its profits to £14.1m ($22.6m, €16.3m) in the year to March. In the US, Hot Topic, which sells music merchandise to teenagers, reported a 19 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits and Buckle, another youth-focused fashion chain, has recorded double-digit monthly sales growth over the past year.TNS, the consumer research group, says that while under-35s spend 30 per cent of their total clothing budget on discounted items, all other age categories spend 35 per cent.In an effort to ingratiate itself with its most lucrative customers, Westfield’s London shopping centre is planning an indoor summer festival, including indie punk bands and Nintendo Wiis. Even Liberty – more often known as purveyor of paisley patterns to the middle-aged – is having a go. The luxury department store has teamed up with Nike to create a range of vintage floral basketball shoes and roped in Kate Moss and Topshop to design dresses.“We had to refresh and bring in a new crowd,” says Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, Liberty’s chief executive. “The youth don’t like arrogance or stiffness.”One explanation for young people’s increased spending power may be that they are living with their parents for longer or choosing to rent rather than buy.“If you don’t have a mortgage, you’re not going to be so worried about losing your job,” says Andrew Wade, a retail analyst at Numis investment bank. It is fear of unemployment, rather than unemployment itself, that stops people spending and encourages them to save more, he says.For the British, growing up during 16 years of uninterrupted economic growth has also had an effect, by giving the young an “innate sense of entitlement”, according to JWT, the US-based advertising agency.“If you see something that you like, then you’re going to get it, yeah?” says student Sattar Mozafari as he walks out of the Westfield outlet of HMV, the entertainment chain, computer game in hand.You no longer need to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth to get what you want: a credit card in the back pocket will do.This generation has grown up watching back-to-back adverts for unsecured loans, learnt the art of financial leverage before tea-time thanks to television programmes such as Property Ladder, and is used to being offered store cards every time they get to the check-out.The credit-boom babies are programmed to buy, buy, buy and it seems the credit crunch may not be enough to break the habit. In fact, credit card spending has risen every month since the start of this year, according to figures from the UK Card Association, and is down less than 3 per cent from 2008.But, above all, young people’s determination to keep spending comes down to the simple fact that consumerism is cool.In 2003, “bling-bling” earned a place in the Oxford English Dictionary, defining an era of popular culture based on unashamed materialism.While past youth movements – from hippies to ravers – rejected capitalist consumerism, the urban music scene made ostentatious signs of wealth not only acceptable but highly desirable.Cash is for flashing, gold is for hanging around your neck and, in the words of New York rapper 50 Cent, life is there to “get rich or die tryin’”.However, just as retailers are trying to court this market by learning how to get down with the kids, there are some signs that young shoppers are beginning to change their ways.Last week, Nick Robertson, Asos’s chief executive, was surprisingly gloomy for a man who had just seen his company’s profits double.“Young people are going to come under pressure too and, if you ask me what my health-check on retail over the next 12 months is, well, I’m saying it’s not good. I don’t see any green shoots at all.”Certainly, the dire outlook for youth unemployment will test the resolve of the most blasé of spenders and young people may soon be forced at last to tighten their belts – even if does mean covering up those Calvin Klein boxer shorts.Employment agency Reed says: “For students looking for summer work this year, it’s almost impossible for them to find anything. They’re competing against people who have been made redundant who are already quite experienced.”The “bling culture” may also be losing its sparkle as anti-globalist sentiment gains momentum in the recession. The G20 protests in March and the bubbling resentment over bankers suggest brazen affluence is already something to be coy about or even ashamed of and the “green” movement may soon put a damper on “consumer chic”.Rupa Huq, a lecturer on cultural studies at London’s Kingston University, says: “Youth culture today is crucially plural. While there is the bling generation present, who attach importance to labels culture and conspicuous consumption, the past 10-15 years has also seen the development of an anti-consumerist movement which has the potential to be huge in recessionary times.”
584;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-06-28T22:33:25Z;Microsoft puts Razorfish up for sale;;Microsoft has appointed Morgan Stanley to find a potential buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency.Publicis, the French marketing company that says it is planning more acquisitions in online advertising, is thought to be a possible bidder.Microsoft acquired the agency, formerly called Avenue A Razorfish, as part of its $6bn takeover of aQuantive in 2007.One analyst valued Razorfish at $600m-$700m, based on sales of about $400m last year and profit margins for similar businesses of 12-13 per cent.The analyst said: “Much more than that would be overpaying”, adding that even in digital marketing, valuations had fallen since last year, when Advertising Age trade magazine reported a valuation of $800mIn August, two years after the aQuantive deal, more favourable tax implications will provide an opportunity for Microsoft to sell an asset some view as a conflict of interest with Microsoft Advertising, which sells technology to rival agencies.Microsoft declined to comment.Razorfish, which has headquarters in Seattle, is one of the largest digital agencies, with 2,000 employees. Clients include Audi, Nike and Kraft.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, said funds from a refinancing this month could be used for acquisitions, particularly in digital and emerging markets, which are performing better than traditional advertising in the US and Europe.“There are some opportunities” for acquisitions, he said.“Obviously if we can take advantage of the current situation to be ready to take these things, it’s good.”Publicis had previously said that its issuance of €719m ($1bn) in convertible bonds was related to a refinancing due in 2012.Mr Lévy said there was currently a “window where it looks like it is relatively easy to raise money” even if there was no “immediate need”.He did not name potential targets and declined to comment on whether he would be interested in acquiring Razorfish.But one analyst, who asked not to be named, said: “Publicis would be willing to look at everything. It has the best balance sheet and the most to do.” Razorfish is “the more likely name”.Publicis and Microsoft Advertising on Friday announced a broad strategic agreement, including Publicis’s VivaKi unit using Microsoft technology to place targeted advertising on television set-top boxes.Other agency groups, such as Omnicom and WPP, which are facing the same structural shift of marketing budgets into digital, could also be interested in Razorfish.
585;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-06-25T20:43:58Z;Retail sector leads Wall Street rally;;"US stocks staged an impressive broad-based rally on Thursday with retail stocks leading the way.Home furnishings retailers fared especially well after Bed Bath & Beyond reported an unexpected rise in profits with cost cuts and new store openings making up for a fall in same-store sales. Its shares climbed 9.5 per cent to $31.08.That lifted rival retailers, with Home Depot rising 3.9 per cent to $23.57 and
Target gaining 4.2 per cent to $40.31. Lowe’spicked up 3.8 per cent to $18.87.Office Depot, meanwhile, jumped 7.8 per cent to $4.42 after Goldman Sachs said the $350m cash injection from BC Partners earlier this week could enable the retailer to merge with another company.An apparent stabilisation in sales of homewares also encouraged JPMorgan to upgrade shares in JC Penney, which gained 6 per cent to $28.20, lifting rival department stores with it.Kohl’s picked up 2.3 per cent to $44.43 and Macyâ€™s climbed 3.9 per cent to $11.83.But there was bad news elsewhere in the consumer sector as Nike reported quarterly earnings that missed consensus estimates once restructuring costs had been factored in.Investors were also disappointed by the news that forward orders had fallen 12 per cent and Nike shares lost 3.3 per cent to $51.28.Economic data showed that the US economy contracted 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, slightly less than had previously been estimated.But investors focused on the fact that more people claimed jobless benefits last week than expected.The data saw the markets open in negative territory but they then rose as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on last year’s takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.Mr Bernanke was accused on Wednesday by a senior Republican of being part of a “cover-up” concerning what disclosures should be made about the deal.That knocked the market’s faith in the Fed on the day it decided to keep interest rates low, but some of that confidence returned on Thursday as Mr Bernanke defended his position.Mr Bernanke was also supported by President Barack Obama, who said he had confidence in the job he had done.“Mr Bernanke’s comments seemed fairly justifiable, and that probably held up the market a little bit,” said Nick Kalivas.“People seemed pretty nervous about the testimony but I am not sure there was anything there that constituted the smoking gun that might quicken his demise.”The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all rose 2.1 per cent to 920.26, 8,472.40 and 1,829.54, respectively.“It has been very difficult to push this market down,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There has been a continual flow of investor money as the awareness grows that recovery is coming.”Bank of America fell during the morning, with many on Wall Street saying the investigation into the Merrill purchase could make Ken Lewis, chief executive, more vulnerable than Mr Bernanke.It was also hit by analysis from Citi, which warned that BofA could have a
difficult quarter as it builds capital in case of further loan losses.But the shares picked up ground during the day as nervousness about Mr Bernanke’s testimony abated. They closed flat at $12.35.There was a glimmer of hope on US housing as Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, the homebuilder, said he sensed some pent-up demand from potential home buyers. This helped the company’s shares climb 17.5 per cent to $9.19, even though it reported a bigger loss than expected as falling house prices continued to take their toll.Other homebuilders were also lifted. Centex advanced 5.8 per cent to $8.58 while KB Homeclimbed 8.3 per cent to $14.77.There were encouraging signs on investor appetite as Medidata, a clinical technology company, made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, jumping 21.4 per cent to $17 on the day of its initial public offering. The shares had initially been priced at $14."
586;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Alice.com site to take on supermarkets;;Top US household goods brands are backing the launch of an e-commerce website this week that could further shake up the already fraught relations between large retailers and their main suppliers.The site, Alice.com, sells leading name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Huggies baby products at prices that are in line with mass discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target, and about 20 per cent below online rivals.Brian Wiegand and Mark McGuire, the founders of Alice, say about half of the 6,000 items on the site – which also provides free shipping – are covered by a potentially revolutionary direct-from-the-supplier sales model that they intend to extend to all participating suppliers.Unlike retail sites such as Amazon or Drugstore.com, the site’s revenues will be dependent on advertising rather than the conventional retailer’s mark-up on the cost of goods.While it will charge suppliers a service fee on each sale to cover costs, it will not own the inventory itself.High-value brands such as Nike or Estée Lauder already sell direct to consumers from their own company websites. But the approach has not made economic sense for manufacturers of low-margin items such as soap and toothpaste.Mr Wiegand argues that the single online platform provided by Alice will allow consumer goods companies “to get in touch with the consumer in a way that doesn’t work if they do it on their own”.Mr McGuire says the site could “rebalance” manufacturers’ relations with retailers, which have increasingly been developing their own lower-cost private-label goods that they promote alongside national brands.Consumer-goods companies have become increasingly interested in the potential of internet sales, and there has been a steady although slow increase in sales of items such as baby products from online retailers such as Amazon.com, Drugstore.com and Diapers.com.But manufacturers have also been been wary of exploring the potential of direct sales because of fears of antagonising the large retailers they depend on for the bulk of their business.In an indication of the sensitivity of the direct sales issue, Alice is not saying which manufacturers are already using its direct model but says all those on the site – which include Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, SC Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive – have expressed an interest in its business potential.“If they can figure out a way to make money, that’s wonderful,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.“But a lot of smart people have been trying to crack this nut for a while and have lost their shirts doing so.”
587;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-06-15T14:28:16Z;Reebok restructures under Adidas;;"Reebok aims to overtake Puma as the world’s third largest sporting goods brand in the next five years but it is facing a tough battle to rebuild its former high-quality image.After years in which the brand name was tarnished by its running shoes being sold cheaply alongside steaks and beer in supermarkets, Reebok-owner Adidas last year started the largest overhaul in the US company’s history.After launching heavy investments in product management, design and development as well as streamlining marketing and sales efforts, Adidas hopes to revive Reebok’s former glory.But the organisational revamp has turned into an uphill struggle after a sharp fall in consumer demand as a result of the global financial crisis. In the first quarter, Reebok posted an operating loss of €96m.This has prompted analysts to lose their patience. Commerzbank’s Christoph Dolleschal calls Reebok a “never-ending restructuring story”. Others have begun saying that the overhaul is Adidas’s last chance to turn Reebok round.Uli Becker, chief executive of Reebok, is aware of the pressure but is confident that, with the measures he has taken, the US sporting goods brand will hit the ground running once the economy bounces back.“We were not shocked by the crisis because Reebok has been facing challenging situations for years,” Mr Becker says.He believes Reebok will become Adidas’ main growth engine.“We want to kick the number three from the podium within the next five years,” he says, referring to Reebok’s current fourth rank behind Puma, Adidas and Nike as a global sporting goods brand.But he bows to critics who say that it has taken Adidas far too long to reorganise Reebok after it bought it in early 2006 as a weapon in its fight with main rival Nike.“We underestimated the amount of time needed for the restructuring,” the Reebok head admits.But Mr Becker, who was sent from Adidas to Reebok in 2006, originally as chief marketing officer, points to the dire state which Reebok was in at the time of the €3bn deal.“Reebok was light years away from being…a global brand,” he says.The company was concentrating its efforts on the US and UK markets, and Mr Becker says it was concerned with sales rather than focusing on the brand and its quality. The fall in the price paid for Reebok shoes mirrored the decline in its brand image – in the end consumers saw Reebok in the same light as unbranded products.Adidas’ first steps to get Reebok back on track involved investing heavily in its products, in particular by stepping up product management, design and development.Mr Becker says the quality and design of the brand’s shoes have become competitive again. “We will now have to heighten the consumer profile of the brand.”Steps towards this have already been taken in women’s products, where Reebok launched a partnership with Canadian circus company Cirque du Soleil and a new fitness shoe.Similar initiatives will be launched for men’s products next year. In addition, a large-scale marketing campaign for the whole brand is planned for 2010.There are tentative signs of improvement in the business. Mr Becker says he expects women’s products to grow significantly this year; in the first quarter, it grew at a double-digit rate.Overall, sales at Reebok are forecast to remain flat this year, after falling by a fifth each year since Adidas bought the company.Mr Becker says the company has deliberately forgone revenue as the price to pay for exiting cheaper products. A year ago Reebok sold 30 per cent of its shoes for $29.90 (€21.60), these “junk sales” had come down to a tenth in the first quarter of this year.“We hope that we can close this chapter by the end of the year,” he says.To save costs, the company recently integrated central Adidas and Reebok functions into “joint operating models” in Asia, Europe and Latin America. As a consequence, several hundred jobs were slashed in sales, service and other areas. At Reebok, 300 people had to leave this year, reducing its workforce to 8,000.Mr Becker envisages a similar structure for North America, where Adidas’ base is in Portland and Reebok’s in Boston.Reebok will now concentrate on growth and on the goal to regain its long-gone status as a highly profitable brand, Mr Becker says. Well aware of the difficult market situation and the intense pressure from the capital markets, he does not set a public date for this to happen.“The aim is to become as profitable as Adidas,” is the only profitability target he is willing to give."
588;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-06-13T01:50:34Z;The rubber sole is on the rise;Synthetics are making strides in the men’s luxury shoe market;"The leather-soled men’s shoe may be equated with craft, quality and tradition but is it being usurped by a younger, more modern rival? According to a report at the Satra Technology Centre in Kettering, Northamptonshire, the rubber sole is on the rise. Between eight and nine per cent of footwear worldwide is produced with rubber soles, while leather accounts for just seven per cent.The biggest advantage of the rubber sole is its “quality perception”, says Klaus Kjaersgaard, vice-president of global marketing for the footwear company Ecco, whose “Business Comfort” system of formal, synthetic-soled shoes has seen annual double-digit sales growth since its launch. “It’s less that the perception of leather soled shoes has declined, and more that synthetic-soled shoes have increased in line with improved quality and style,” he says.Since Prada launched its first synthetic-soled shoes in the early 1990s, the idea that an upmarket shoe can exist without a leather sole has become increasingly accepted. “Leather is still a fantastic material to work with – which is why it remains the main material for uppers. It moulds to your feet,” says Tim Little, owner of the eponymous shoe brand that now puts a rubber sole on one-third of its styles. “But leather-soled shoes are less versatile, more expensive, and becoming more of a premium, niche item. Putting a leather sole on an upper is a long process and completely uncommercial,” he says.Mario Polegato, chief executive of Geox, another big manufacturer of “comfort” footwear, agrees rubber soles have advantages. “A synthetic sole is lighter and more comfortable than leather, which needs to be broken in,” he says. “Leather is limited. It can’t be used on children’s shoes or on sports shoes – and they account for 50 per cent of global shoe sales.”Indeed, the rise of the sports shoe in fashion has changed the consumer’s perception of how a shoe should feel: they now expect immediate comfort and the convenience of slip-resistance and full waterproofing. Synthetic soles (resin rubber or crêpe, PVC or polyurethane) increasingly play the eco card, too. The outdoor pursuits brand Patagonia, for example, has developed one sole made from recycled scrap rubber and another made of renewable hevea milk that is stitched on rather than glued, thus reducing the use of adhesives.According to Urko Berrioaegortua Diaz, polymer engineer for Camper shoes, the brand that pioneered the sporty-formal hybrid shoe, a synthetic sole is simply the modern choice. “Craft, and hence quality, in shoemaking has long been associated with the leather sole because that was the only material available,” says Diaz. “Advances in industry have pushed what is possible with synthetics. Consumers may associate quality with leather but the idea that a rubber sole means a cheap shoe is fading rapidly.”“It’s like the watch market,” says Alain Vilot, president of JM Weston, where rubber-soled shoes account for one-third of the spring/summer collection. “Now you can wear a gold watch or a plastic watch, and you may have both. Similarly, a rubber-soled shoe does not look out of place in business, as business dress gets more casual.”“That’s true even with women’s dress shoes,” adds designer Rae Jones. “But there is some resistance, even if women may have more need for rubber soles because of the instability of many of the styles they wear.”Perhaps the synthetic sole’s only disadvantage is that it is not naturally breathable, an issue that has been tackled by Geox by introducing a sole punched with microscopic air holes. And yet Geox has also recently developed its own leather sole, adding full waterproofing to its natural breathability. “There is still a demand for the leather-soled shoe,” says Mario Polegato. “I think leather soles will be increasingly relegated to special-occasion shoes. The question is, with generations coming through that make no such associations with leather soles, whether even that way of thinking will last.”………………………………….Detailswww.camper.com

589;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-06-13T01:50:14Z;Sleeker sneakers;;When Michelle Obama wore ribboned, metallic Lanvin sneakers while volunteering at a soup kitchen in April, it started a debate: where had her signature kitten heels gone? Was her selection too casual or too “fashion”? In truth, the first lady was simply demonstrating what the style industry and the women it serves have known for some time – even women who love heels need a comfortable flat shoe every now and again.As Courtney Adamo, founder of internet magazine Babyccino.com, says, “I refuse to sacrifice style, but when I know I will be doing an amount of walking, I have to opt for trainers.” Enter what English shoe maestro Rupert Sanderson calls “the sports shoe as daywear” – trainers that don’t really resemble or feel like trainers. Using more feminine fabrics and narrower lasts than the usual male-inspired trainers, they fill the need for something casual, comfortable and muted that can be worn to work.Liberty and Nike recently collaborated to create a retro reissue of Nike’s 1970s Blazer basketball-style shoe covered in a Liberty print. The trainers sold out the day they were introduced. Since when, Christian Lacroix has teamed up with Gola to produce a bright, embroidered rubber-soled number, and Sergio Rossi and Puma have produced the Clyde, a shiny satin sneaker in a feminine colour palette that is a modern version of a vintage-looking tennis shoe (there’s also a high-heeled version). According to Holli Rogers, Net à Porter’s buying director, half of their stock sold out in the first two weeks online. No surprise, then, that for autumn she’s introducing a metallic “high-top” sneaker from Lanvin. “We anticipate that these will be immensely popular too,” says Rogers. “We know our customers look for luxury and style in every aspect of their lives, and that includes everyday wear.”Emma Hope anticipated this trend back in 2004 when she launched her fashion trainers for men and women. Inspired by the basic plimsolls she wore when growing up, she wanted to offer a more sophisticated, glamorous version that was elegant but functional. The trainers – which come in finishes such as velvet, suede and leather, and sport an almost pointed toe – now make up 30 per cent of her sales.Traditional companies such as Converse are also getting in on the act. Last year it issued a sleeker version of its classic design, the Converse Allstar Light, intended to offer a more “lightweight, feminine silhouette”, with a much slimmer rubber sole and an almond toe, making it similar to Keds, Bensimons and Supergas, retro pumps and tennis shoes of the last century.UK-based F-Troupe founder Mick Hoyle has decided to launch a plastic, slimline version of a retro sneaker for summer. Likened to a “flip-flop crossed with a plimsoll”, he says it’s part of a new trend for low-tech traditional construction. “But mostly,” Hoyle says, “I think that it is OK to like America again, and this feels very old school American.”Because such pumps are as attractive as they are comfortable, they are infiltrating the workplace. And not just for women: Adamo’s husband, for example, wears one of his five pairs of Emma Hopes to the office “three days out of five”.
590;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-05-28T20:39:41Z;Methods: Revolution sweeps the workplace;;A manager in a manufacturing company is glaring at a senior executive from one of its suppliers across a teleconferencing link. The definition is good enough for each to see the whites of the other’s eyes. The manager leans forward: “You are going to deliver these components on time, aren’t you,” he says, daring his opposite number to come up with an excuse for failing to meet his obligations.It’s a scenario which, hopefully in less confrontational mode, could become commonplace, as new ways of working based on ubiquitous and universal connectivity – described by communications group Nortel as “hyperconnectivity” – sweep through the business world.Anyone who doubts that these new ways of collaborating are fomenting a business revolution need only look at patterns of traffic across the world’s telecommunications networks.According to Lloyd Salvage, vice-president of global marketing for the US telecoms giant AT&T, 40 per cent of all the traffic passing across the company’s network is video: “This is a dramatic change over the past five years.”Some of this video is consumer traffic – individuals downloading movies or using social networking sites such as Facebook – but organisations are increasingly using video as a training medium, for instance, or for communication with staff or, as in the example above, with suppliers.Companies such as AT&T are providing high definition teleconferencing systems which can radically alter the way an organisation does business. Mr Salvage provides an example that is close to home for AT&T: members of his marketing team are based across the globe and use of teleconferencing for a recent meeting saved the company $17,841 in hotel and travelling costs.Today, AT&T and its competitors are spending billions of dollars annually to ensure that, as the current recession gives way to growth, the infrastructure, networking speed and capacity are in place to support hyperconnectivity for companies large and small. “Collaboration is for all and not just the few,” Mr Salvage says.Connecting with customers, suppliers, partners – and even competitors – through a variety of networks will mean companies will have to re-examine their business processes and beliefs: “The technology is changing the nature of what it means to be an organisation,” says Rob Gear of PA Consulting.IBM, for example, once one of the world’s most inward-looking organisations, has embraced social networking (see ‘Managing the change’ at www.ft.com/connectivity).For 18 months, Mr Gear has been working with Carsten Sorensen of the London School of Economics to consider how businesses should face up to the challenge: “Historically, organisations have protected themselves with impenetrable buildings, security guards and complex rules and procedures,” he says.“Technology is challenging this approach, especially around the boundaries of the organisation. It can be difficult to understand who should be inside and who should not. Our top level finding is that this new way of working has tremendous possibilities for innovation and new business models but there are incredible risks as well.”There are powerful examples of companies which have redefined themselves in the process of building new business models.Mr Gear says: “You see companies which were previously manufacturers becoming more like service providers. The engineering group Rolls-Royce, for example, no longer sells aero engines: it sells flight time – it says ‘We will provide this many hours of uninterrupted flight time for your aircraft before things fail.’“At a more mundane level, you don’t buy a photocopier any more, you buy ‘an integrated copy experience’ where the machine is monitored remotely 24 hours a day. Before it breaks down, a technician turns up because they were monitoring the machine and knew it was just about to go wrong.”But, Mr Gear says, not all collaboration is good: “You can have too much collaboration. Heinz, the foods company, for example, invited members of the public to make their own videos to promote a brand of ketchup.“At face value it was a great idea, but it missed out by failing to allow the public to do the filtering and voting. Heinz was left with a pile of technically inadequate videos some of which carried the wrong message. When you bring people in from outside – you have to formalise processes that had been fluid. You cannot afford to give your collaborators too much discretion or you will end up with mayhem.”Mr Gear argues that companies should automate as much as possible, find ways of enabling customers to provide and maintain information about themselves while retaining and selectively applying discretion: “And that is the expensive part,” he says.So it is all about the customer. Andy Mulholland, global chief technology officer for the consultancy Capgemini, uses the airline industry as an example of the new regime: “Over 10 years we have moved from fixed price tickets to a situation where you can interact with the airline online to see what combinations of destination, departure time and luggage allowance are available.“The network used to be something that connected computers. Now it has become a business tool based around the concept of ‘how do I find and do business with a variety of people and partners and – internally – link up my resources to provide flexibility’.”He points to the example of Nike, the sports equipment manufacturer, which in one initiative organised 800,000 people to take part in a 10km run in 23 cities as if it was one competition.“Running had been a lonely activity. Now you were running with other people and testing yourself against them. Running became a friendly thing with social connections. And Nike’s share of the running shoe market increased by more than 10 per cent over the promotion.It will, however, mean changes in the “boiler room” – not all of them welcome. A recent research paper from Capgemini*, outlines the problem facing IT departments: “The bad news is that corporate IT will struggle to keep up. The constraints on organisations are increasing: regulation is increasing and so are the risks to organisations – whether through loss of personal data, hacking or failure to comply with legal requirements.“The CIO is particularly under pressure because IT is often seen as the cause of the problems or a brake on progress. The dilemma is to manage risk while enabling the organisation to connect and innovate.”But, it goes on: “An old friend, the organisation’s IT network, turns out to be a source of salvation. At the intersection between the external and internal networks, it is in a unique position to do more than merely connect. It can help manage in a way which is ever vigilant but unobtrusive.“It can also start to interpret activity in ways which are only starting to be recognised and intervene in real-time. Free from concerns for security and compliance, CIOs can turn their attention to adding value to the organisation by providing the necessary tools for users to engage in the new world.”None of this will happen by accident, however. Companies will have to think hard about their role in the market and how they can position themselves for change. A forward-looking, flexible architecture is a prerequisite. And, as in most things, fortune will favour the prepared.*The Big Network. Why the IT network assumes new importance in the connected world. Capgemini, 2009……………………………………………………………………………………………

He joined in January after winning the City’s respect for bringing Next back from the brink of collapse.While he said the suppliers’ long lead times meant sales would not improve until late this year, Sir David said the company had already taken orders from Adidas and Nike.JJB’s rival, JD Sports, has outperformed rivals largely due to exclusive contracts to sell brands such as Adidas Originals, popular with young shoppers.Sir David also blamed heavy annual losses on Chris Ronnie, who was fired as chief executive in March after a personal transaction resulted in the loss of his 23 per cent stake in the company when Iceland’s Kaupthing bank collapsed.He said JJB would concentrate on customers who were “serious about sport” rather than following JD’s pursuit of high fashion or Sports Direct’s discounting.The group swung to a pre-tax loss of £189.2m in the year to January 25 from a profit of £10.8m in the previous year, mainly as a result of total exceptional charges of £171.7m arising from restructuring costs.Annual revenue dropped from £811.8m to £718.3m and the group reported losses per share of 69.19p compared with last year’s earnings of 4.07p.JJB is not paying a final dividend It paid a total of 10p in the previous year. The shares closed up 2p at 30p.
592;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-04-28T20:43:41Z;Wall St slips despite bright data;;"US stocks slipped on Tuesday after a day of fluctuations as better-than-expected economic data mitigated fears over capital positions at Citigroup and Bank of America.The two banking groups fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve had told Citi and Bank of America they might need more capital after seeing early results of the banking stress tests.The Journal was the second newspaper to report that Citigroup might need more capital, based on the test results. The Financial Times said the same on Saturday.The company lost 5.9 per cent to $2.89, while Bank of America fell 8.6 per cent to $8.15.Losses in the financial sector were balanced by gains elsewhere after data showing consumer confidence jumped during April sparked buying of consumer stocks.Analysts had been expecting only a modest rise, and the surprise news led to Nikeadvancing 2.7 per cent to $55.59 and handbag and accessory retailer Coach gaining 6.1 per cent to $23.48.Office Depot reported a surprise profit for the first quarter and jumped 11.5 per cent to $2.82.Further support for the markets came from figures showing the fall in house prices slowed in February. On an annual basis, the figures showed the first improvement in the rate of change since December 2005.There was an extra boost for equities from the fact that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area during April contracted at a slower pace than last month, a
better performance than analysts expected.Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investments, said: “Over the course of the morning, we have nothing but phenomenal data. The market has taken all of those things and decided things are getting better.”The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 855.16 points and 1,673.81 points respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.1 per cent to 8,016.95 points.There was some good news for healthcare stocks, which have been one of the few beneficiaries of the spread of swine flu because of the potential for increased demand of drugs and medical care.Gilead Sciences continued to build on its gains of the previous session. The company, which developed the flu drug Tamiflu, rose 0.2 per cent to $47.60 as investors bet on high demand for the product with the number of people affected by swine flu continuing to rise.Waters Corp, the laboratory services company, led the healthcare sector higher after reporting rising profits in spite of falling revenues. Its shares jumped 16.3 per cent to $43.83. But the global drug giants Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb both struggled for momentum in spite of reporting better results than expected.Pfizer lost 0.7 per cent to $13.39 after its first-quarter revenues disappointed Wall Street, even though successful cost cuts allowed the company to beat expectations and reaffirm its full-year profit outlook.Bristol-Myers Squibb made a similar announcement as revenues fell short of forecasts, but cost-cutting efforts meant the company reported marginally better earnings than expected. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to $19.65.There was added strength from the health insurance sector after Coventry Health Care announced it beat analysts’ estimates with its earnings in spite of a drop in profits. The stock picked up 7.1 per cent to $15.22.But US Steel tumbled after reporting losses that were more than double what analysts had forecast and cut its dividend after steel prices plunged.The company said it would issue shares and notes to pay off debt, about $1.6bn of which was downgraded to junk by Moody’s. The company’s shares fell 5.6 per cent to $26.15.Other steel companies also suffered after the World Steel Association warned on Monday that global demand for was likely to fall 14.9 per cent this year.AK Steel lost 1.1 per cent to $11.72 while Nucor fell 3.7 per cent to $37.50.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the market could continue to rally in spite of Tuesday’s falls. “Everybody wants to see a pull back, but if everybody wants it to go down, it won’t go down. The markets tend to frustrate most people.”"
593;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-04-28T14:15:42Z;Fashion: Big fish and minnows alike flourish in smaller pond;;In Barcelona’s fashionable Passeig de Grácia, there is a temple to the business model of Inditex, one of Europe’s most successful clothes retailers.Although based in Galicia, in Spain’s north-west, the creator of the Zara fashion range chose the country’s most stylish city to site one of the biggest Zara-branded stores in the world.A magnet to tourists and locals alike, the emblematic 1,900 sq m outlet is also among the world’s busiest, and one of only a few Zara shops with a Zara Home – which sells soft furnishings – incorporated inside.To many visitors, a stroll to the Passeig de Gràcia emporium to check out the latest in Zara’s affordable catwalk-inspired apparel is part of the Barcelona experience.That many of Inditex’s other brands – namely streetwear line Stradivarius, the smart Massimo Dutti and Bershka’s casual wear for women – started life as Catalan companies should come as little surprise.Barcelona, and the region, has been a Spanish and European reference for fashion design and marketing for the better part of the past four decades. For centuries before that, Catalonia’s industrial valleys and towns turned out textiles for Spain and the rest of Europe. Although the region has, since the 1950s, lost much of its textile production to low-cost centres such as Turkey, northern Africa, eastern Europe and Asia, Barcelona’s mild climate, funky street life and stylish ambience stay on as an inspiration to young designers.Regular events, often sponsored by the city and regional governments, promote this image, while endeavouring to help young talent. The city also lends its name to fashion brands such as Mango, sometimes know as “the other Zara”, and the youthful Custo.A global trend-setter conceived in Barcelona, Mango’s first store was opened in the city in 1984, also in the Passeig de Gràcia.From humble beginnings selling imported jeans at a flea market in Barcelona about 30 years, Mango founder Isak Andic today presides over a company with sales of €1.4bn ($1.8bn) and a presence in 90 countries.The son of Turkish immigrants, his rise to prominence in the cut-throat world of fashion retailing has helped Barcelona consolidate as a global reference in the sector.With its huge administrative headquarters, design and logistics centre just outside the Catalan capital, Mango is today Spain’s second largest textile and clothing exporter, behind Inditex.Custo, founded by Barcelona-born brothers Custo and David Dalmau, is another global brand intimately identified with the Catalan capital. Inspired by the hippy and beach fashions of California in the 1970s and 1980s, the brothers started out selling colourful T-shirts to the domestic markets before creating the “Custo Barcelona” brand in 1996.Their flashy, colourful designs caused a sensation at the 1997 New York Fashion Week, earning them a following among Hollywood celebrities such as Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Claudia Schiffer. Today, Custo derives more than 80 per cent of its sales outside Spain, and boasts about 3,000 points of sale across the globe.“Barcelona will never be Milan, Paris or London,” says Paula Feferbaum, a fashion designer who settled in the city from Brazil 16 years ago. “But in many respects it is easier to get recognised here and be taken seriously.”Ms Feferbaum’s story is typical of scores of designers and retailers who have made Barcelona their base. After a stint working for Custo and other fashion houses, she launched her own successful Paulinha Rio club wear line in the late 1990s.From there she branched into fashion promotion, organising a series of events to showcase her work and that of other young designers from Barcelona and elsewhere.Called Circuit, her programme of events became well-known in Barcelona, as they were often staged in the city’s streets and squares, or in the lobbies of historic buildings such as museums. The concept was finally adopted by the municipal and regional governments, which have thrown their promotional muscle behind the industry.For years, Barcelona hosted the Bread&Butter trade fair of urban fashion brands, and will this year launch the Brandery, a similar event. Jordi Hereu, the mayor of Barcelona, describes the new fair as a “personal project that would help Barcelona become a reference point for international trade fairs in contemporary fashion”.Ms Feferbaum, meanwhile, is busy with Clarity, the company founded with brother Paulo that specialises in product launches and branding, and includes among its client list the likes of Nike, Swarovski, Maybelline, and L’Oréal.“Basically, if you provide the platform, talent will flourish,” she says.This space to create and be seen has inspired scores of others. Desigual, founded by Swiss designer Thomas Meyer in the 1980s, is another brand that has prospered in Barcelona. After starting out selling his designer T-shirts to club-goers in Ibiza, one of the Balearic Islands, Mr Meyer can today count on 50 own-brand stores, out of about 1,500 points of sale across Europe and parts of Asia and the Middle East.“Barcelona inspires, and it is not stuffy and closed like Milan or too competitive like London and Paris,” says Ms Feferbaum.“Sometimes it’s more rewarding being a bigger fish in a smaller pond.”
594;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-04-24T16:35:27Z;Liberty designs an upward pattern;;"Floral-patterned trainers have helped boost sales at Liberty, the retail and fashion group, as its newly restructured fabrics division helped to compensate for sales declines at its two outlets in London’s West End.However, the company still reported a loss due to heavy expenditure on staff restructuring, the opening of a new store on Sloane Street in London, and the revamping of the company’s online retail business.“2008 was a year of restructuring,” said Geoffroy de la Bourdonnaye, Liberty chief executive.“We had to change quite a lot of people in the company, particularly in the retail side. Our staff turnover in the past year was in excess of 50 per cent; we had to restructure staffing on the floor, restructure the buying operation and restructure merchandising as well,” he said.“All those investments came in 2008 and are starting to bear fruit in 2009.”For the full-year that ended in December, pre-tax losses widened by 9 per cent to £7m on revenues that rose 9 per cent to £50.2m. The loss per share increased by 4.5 per cent to 32.8p.Mr de la Bourdonnaye declined to say when exactly Liberty would return to profitability, but said that it would be “certainly within the next three years”.Liberty Art Fabrics, which makes fabrics for designers, saw the fastest sales growth in the group, up 31 per cent over the course of the year to £17.4m. The division was restructured in 2007 to encompass new fabrics and designs, and it now has sales operations in the US, Russia and China, and sells fabrics to companies such as Nike, Cacharel, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.“We are appealing to a very young generation,” said Mr de la Bourdonnaye. “Our Nike trainers sold out in a day.”Shares in Liberty were unmoved Friday at 220p."
595;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-04-04T01:17:05Z;‘I can breathe the air of the ocean’;;"Yves Behar, 41, is the founder of Fuseproject, a design agency dedicated to the development of the emotional experience of brands through storytelling. His work spans technology, furniture, sports, lifestyle products and fashion for clients including Herman Miller, Cassina, Swarovski, Nike, Hussein Chalayan, Birkenstock, Toshiba, Sony and Microsoft. He studied industrial design in Europe and the US and his work has featured in solo shows in San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art and Musée de Design et d’Arts Appliqués Contemporains in Lausanne, Switzerland. His many awards include the prestigious National Design Award for industrial design from the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. He lives in San Francisco with his son, Sky.What attracted you to your current home?
I recently moved from the city’s outskirts to the postcard view of San Francisco. After 16 years in the city I still feel like a tourist in awe of the Golden Gate Bridge, the bay and the surrounding hills. I have lived here for a year and my home still feels new and spare. It’s a two-bedroom, two-bathroom rental apartment with a large dining room that makes a perfect work-week’s nest. My weekends are spent at a beach, 45 minutes away.Where did you live previously?
I lived in an Oakland Hills 1960s California house. The impetus for my move into the city was a desire for simplification and [wanting] to live the contrast between the city and the beach. The apartment is actually a transition place and the first home that I’m not intending to re-model, although I will do so with my next one. I wanted to bring a sense of clarity to this place by keeping the extraneous details out and only the essentials in.Which is your favourite room?
The living room because it breathes the light and the air of the ocean and is full of changing reflections as the day progresses.What style and ambience have you tried to create?
Ideally a home should reflect a state of mind rather than a style. I wanted to create a good place where I could reflect and experience clean and unencumbered thinking. I wanted it to be efficient, adorned only with essentials (great furniture) and inspiration (great art).Do you live with your own designs?
I do surround myself with familiar and idiosyncratic pieces. I like to mix my recent work – the Leaf lights and Fly bench, Danese’s Kada stools and some of my sculptures such as “Inner Light”, designed for the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco – with strange and unique pieces.Where do you head off to at weekends?
My weekend place is in a magical coastal surfer town north of San Francisco which looks back at the city, almost mirroring the view I have from the apartment. The house sits on a bluff, with the ocean below. It’s a hand-built hippy house with four bedrooms for the many weekend visitors it attracts. It’s a non-design designer house surrounded by vegetation and the neighbours’ houses are not immediately visible. The waves crashing in front of it and the wild animals contrast perfectly with the setting of my city apartment.It sounds wonderfully escapist. Is it reminiscent of your childhood home?
Not really. I was born and grew up in Lausanne, Switzerland. My father is from Istanbul and my mother from eastern Germany. So my childhood home was a mixture of European and Ottoman-influenced furnishings with a garden to play in and two brothers to compete with.Is there a designer or architect, past or present, who has particularly inspired you?
Case-study house architects, such as Richard Neutra and Eero Saarinen, know how to keep spaces open to the landscape. Tadao Ando creates the impossible combination of peaceful materiality and visual drama, while a few younger ones, such as David Adjaye (with whom I share an office in New York), are forging ahead with great work.Is entertaining important to you?
Effortless entertainment is important to me; improvised dinners and parties are my favourites.Do you favour a high-tech or humanist approach to designing?
I actually strive to combine the two elements into what I would call “humanist technology”. My $100 laptop for the One Laptop Per Child initiative or my Jawbone wireless headset are good examples of the way new technology can be humanised.Are you a city or country person?
It’s interesting that you ask. I’m attracted to intensely urban and cultural experiences – the sort you find in New York, London, San Francisco and Paris, where most of my work takes place. But I absolutely do need to take refuge in the country every five to six days for head-clearing surf sessions.What do you miss about San Francisco when you’re away?
San Francisco is the only real city where you can choose to be in city culture or in nature on a whim and be in either environment within 10 minutes or less.Do you have a dream home?
Yes, I’d like to build one at the beach. It would be a place with an open door policy, where you’d literally never need to lock the doors. I want to live at eye-level with the earth so the house would be slightly below-grade with the possibility of walking out into a semi-wild natural environment.Which facilities can’t you live without?
Surfboard storage, a steam bath and art."

597;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-03-11T14:53:44Z;Sport: International status is about much more than football;;A century ago Manchester was best known as the capital of the world’s cotton textile trade. Today, it is best known as the home of Manchester United, one of the world’s most successful football clubs.Manchester may lag well cities such as New York, Madrid and Munich in terms of its economic and business performance. But when it comes to sport it is hard to underestimate the importance of its football teams, which include the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, in promoting the city’s name globally.It has been estimated that Manchester United, owned by the US Glazer family since 2003, has more than 330m fans worldwide, of whom half are in Asia. The club maintains separate websites for fans in China, Korea and Japan, and has recently begun offering Asian fans the chance to go on a virtual reality tour of its Old Trafford “Theatre of Dreams” stadium.However, there is a lot more to Manchester than football. It is home to the British Cycling Federation and Manchester’s velodrome trained the winners of eight gold medals in last year’s Olympics. It is one of the country’s top boxing centres, producing Amir Khan and Ricky Hatton, and in rugby union, rugby league and athletics, has three of the UK’s top teams in Sale Sharks, Wigan Warriors and Sale Harriers respectively.Old Trafford’s Lancashire County Cricket Club is smarting because it has been dropped as a venue for this year’s cricket test match test series. But the city has several big venues, such as the City of Manchester stadium and the MEN Arena, which regularly host a variety of international sporting events unrelated to football.In 2008 Manchester hosted six international sporting events ranging from the final of soccer’s Uefa Cup to world squash and swimming championships. This year it will be hosting several international championships in sports such as cycling, swimming, water polo and netball as well as the Paralympic world cup.Last year was Manchester’s best year for sport since it hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2002, and it was crowned the “Best sports city in the world” by SportsBusiness magazine, beating short-listed cities such as Melbourne, Berlin, Moscow and New York.Eamonn O’Rourke, head of sports and leisure at Manchester city council, stresses that the build-up in Manchester’s international sporting reputation is no accident.The legacy of East Manchester’s SportsCity complex, the site of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, has been fully exploited so that the complex now handles more than 400 sporting events a year attended by 4.5m people.“One of the biggest legacies from the games is that we identified the need for an annual sports development budget,” says Mr O’Rourke. Prior to that Manchester had tried to attract big sporting events on an opportunistic basis. Its £1.6m ($2.2m) annual budget is used to attract events that are strategically important and utilise Manchester’s sporting legacy.The reverberations of the region’s growing importance in the international sports world go well beyond the increasing number of trophies in club sports cabinets. It has also fed through to the development of a growing number of sport-related businesses ranging from sporting goods manufacturers, such as Stockport’s Umbro (now part of Nike) and Bolton’s Reebok (now owned by Adidas), to Fred Done’s Warrington betting operations.Dave Whelan, the former Blackburn Rovers footballer who set up Wigan’s JJB sports retailing chain, is the best-known of a number of local sporting heroes who have moved into business. Others include former England rugby captains Fran Cotton and Steve Smith, who founded the Cotton Traders sport clothing mail order business, and Chubby Chandler, a former PGA European golf professional, whose International Sports Management group manages some of the world’s top golfers and cricketers.Maurice Watkins, Manchester United’s long-time lawyer and senior partner of solicitors Brabners Chaffe Street, praises the city council’s strategy of raising the city’s profile by attracting international sporting events to the city.It has stimulated demand for specialist sport-related legal and financial services from players and clubs a long way from Manchester.Brabners Chaffe Street, for example, which advises more than half of the UK’s Premier League clubs, was appointed recently by Major League Soccer (MLS), the US professional soccer league, and LA Galaxy, to advise on the loan transfer of David Beckham to AC Milan.“While Manchester is not the UK’s financial capital, it is the sports capital,” says Robin Wight, head of HSBC’s global sports group in the north of England. “London-centric companies that ignore Manchester and the north-west as its hub do so at their peril.”“The 2002 Commonwealth Games was a real turning point for British sport in proving to the world that Manchester could host such a high-profile sporting event and maximise the economic benefits associated with it,” says Peter Heginbotham, president of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce and senior partner at law firm Davis Blank Furniss Solicitors.“It really put us on the map and left us with a sporting legacy that no doubt paved the way for London’s Olympic bid.”Turnover £m
598;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;How we’ve poisoned the well of wealth;;Human beings are bad at learning and changing. It takes a good crisis to drive home what may have been staring us in the face.So what in particular are the lessons for all those concerned with saving, investment, borrowing and lending?For many years, under the guise of defending capitalism, we have been allowing ourselves to degrade it. We have been poisoning the well from which we have drawn wealth.We have misunderstood the importance of values to capitalism. We have surrendered to the idea that success is pursued by making as much money as the law allowed without regard to how it was made.Thirty years ago, retailers would be quite content to source the shoes they wanted to sell as cheaply as possible. The working conditions of those who produced them was not their concern.Then headlines and protests developed. Society started to hold them responsible for previously invisible working conditions.Companies like Nike went through a transformation. They realised they were polluting their brand. Global sourcing became visible. It was no longer viable to define success simply in terms of buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest.Financial services and investment are today where footwear was 30 years ago. Public anger at the crisis will make visible what was previously hidden.Take the building up of huge portfolios of loans to poor people on US trailer parks. These loans were authorised without proper scrutiny of the circumstances of the borrowers. Somebody else then deemed them fit to be securitised . . . and so on through credit default swaps and the rest without anyone seeing the transaction in terms of its ultimate human origin.Each of the decision makers thought it okay to act like the thoughtless footwear buyer of the 1970s. The price was attractive. There was money to make on the deal. Was it responsible? Irrelevant. It was legal, and others were making money that way.And the consequences for the banking system if everybody did it? Not our problem.Now we are paying the price in trillions of dollars for that imprudent attitude.One senior investment banker whose business has survived the crisis in good shape recently confirmed this analysis to me. Again and again new product ideas had been put in front of him, without any prior thought about their ethical content.We need a new approach to the investment of people’s savings. The new approach would be ruthlessly transparent about the amount going to fees – recently estimated by David Pitt-Watson [founder and former chairman of Hermes Equity Ownership Services] as equivalent to 40 per cent of the total pension over the lifetime of the investment. It would show savers where their money goes, and how much goes in executive bonuses, fees to investment banks and other intermediaries, and how much is actually invested for them.The consumer has had a profound shock. Surely we could have expected the clever and wise people who invested our money to be better at risk management than they have shown themselves to be in the present crisis?How could they have been so gullible in not challenging the bankers whose lending proved so flaky? How could they have believed that the levels of bonuses that were, at least in part, coming out of their savings could have been justified in “incentivising” a better performance. How could they have believed that a “better” performance would be one that is achieved for one bank without regard to its effect on the whole banking system. Where was the stewardship from those exercising investment on their behalf?The answer has been that very few of them do exercise that stewardship. Most have stood back and said it doesn’t really pay them to do so.The failure of stewardship comes from the same mindset that created the irresponsible lending in the first place. We are back to the mindset that has allowed us to poison the well: never mind the health of the system as a whole, I’m making money out of it at the moment.Responsibility means awareness for the system consequences of our actions. It is not a luxury. It is the cornerstone of prudence. Next month, I will describe the practical and policy implications of a stewardship approach that could restore consumers’ faith in the system.Mark Goyder is founder director of Tomorrow’s Company www.tomorrowscompany.com
599;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-02-13T19:40:41Z;Goalposts are moving for sports sponsorship;;Global companies are being swamped with sponsorship approaches from sports and arts bodies as the economic downturn transforms the business of sponsorship into a buyer’s market.Some of the world’s biggest sponsors are cutting back on deals, although none of those contacted by the Financial Times said they were looking to terminate commitments.However, the economic outlook is prompting nervousness among rights owners who are trying to negotiate longer term deals with clients as a way of building in greater funding security to offset expected declines in sponsorship revenues.Rights holders are gearing up for life without clients from the stricken banking and car sectors and trying to squeeze out more sponsorship dollars from others.“There is a great deal of inventory available and as in any downturn there will be a flight to quality,” said Phil Carling of Octagon, the global marketing company.He added that the shift from a sellers’ market had come at surprising speed. “Premium properties will probably hold their value but, in this market, ‘flat’ will be the new ‘up’.”“It’s a bit more of a buyers’ market,” said Keith Levy, vice-president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch and responsible for the beer company’s US sponsorship deals in baseball, basketball and American football.According to Sports Marketing Surveys, the car and banking sectors were the leading industries of sports sponsorship, which was responsible for 79 per cent of all sponsorship last year.Between them, they signed off 253 of the 713 reported deals last year.British Airways, a London 2012 Olympics sponsor, said it had always attracted interest from rights holders. “But increasingly so, we have noticed that third parties are looking to work with us more and more,” said Luisa Fernandez, global sponsorship manager.Calls are coming in daily to the Emirates Airlines, which sponsors football, rugby and cricket tournaments and teams.“They used to come but not at this frequency,” said Boutros Boutros, of Emirates. “We went after most of our properties but now they are coming to us.”The worsening sponsorship climate follows three years of stellar growth.IEG, a sponsorship advisory arm of the advertising group WPP, expects sponsorship spending by North American companies to increase by only 3.2 per cent, following three years of double-digit growth. Globally, it will rise 3.9 per cent to $44.8bn, IEG believes.BT, official sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics, said of the sponsorship climate that “clearly in worsening economic times, some change is inevitable”, and would be partly driven by upcoming sponsorship opportunities.“For companies like BT, this can be an appropriate time to negotiate new long-term deals cost-effectively,” BT said.Last month, it announced a four-year deal to sponsor the Paralympic World Cup.Nike, the world’s largest sports clothing and shoe company, this week announced a review of its global business structure that may include cutting up to 1,400 jobs, or about 4 per cent of its workforce. The company said the review would include “all aspects of our costs including sports marketing contracts, advertising and brand building activities to ensure we are spending resources wisely”.He said Nike, which endorses LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Maria Sharapova and Ronaldo, as well as the Brazilian football team and Manchester United, also believed “there are opportunities for reductions in sports endorsement contracts and we are evaluating them on a case-by-case basis”.Germany-based rivals Adidas and Puma are not cutting back. Adidas has said it aims to spend about 13 per cent of its net revenues each year on marketing, spending €1.2bn ($1.5bn) last year. Puma spends about 15 per cent on marketing.The global financial crisis has forced some of the world’s biggest sponsors to abandon their relationships.AIG, the bailed-out US insurer, will not renew its shirt sponsorship of Manchester United while Hyundai has taken up advertising spots for the Oscars that were abandoned by General Motors.Nortel’s financial woes threaten the telecommunications group’s sponsorship of next year’s Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the London 2012 Olympics.Its restructuring after seeking bankruptcy protection last month “does involve us taking a hard look at our sponsorships and, in some cases, decide to no longer invest in certain programmes as a sponsor”, said Nortel. But its Olympic commitments remained unchanged, it added.Several companies made it clear they were sticking to their guns. Tsingtao said its main long-term sponsorship, with US basketball, was “not really affected by the financial crisis. It is going well”.Itau, the Brazilian bank, which spends $15m a year on the national football team, concluded that its merger plans with Unibanco meant it made sense to continue the marketing programme.The next two to three months will see fewer sponsorship announcements and activity, according to Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association.“People genuinely don’t quite know how things are going to pan out,” she said.In this climate, rights owners will look to eke out longer term deals from companies willing to do business, Mr Carling said. “This is a characteristic of volatile markets where rights inflation is expected to be low and commercial partners scarce,” he said.“Industry standard models have been two to three years for some time. Expect this model to change to five years where regulation allows.”Additional reporting by Gerrit Weissmann, Paul Taylor, Patti Waldmeir, Daniel Schäfer, Jonathan Birchall, Raphael Minder and Jonathan Wheatley
600;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-02-11T22:01:38Z;Wall Street edges higher on stimulus hopes;;Financial stocks attracted a modicum of bargain hunters on Wall Street on Wednesday, but the wider market struggled to mount a convincing recovery from the previous session’s heavy sell-off.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were among the winners as buyers returned tentatively to the sector. The two largest US banks by market capitalisation climbed 6 per cent to $26.09 and 7 per cent to $17.50, respectively, while regional banks advanced 7.3 per cent.Traders said there was little fundamental to drive buying in the sector following the sharp decline in the week, which came after the bank rescue plan from Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary, failed to inspire confidence.“I haven’t heard anything today that says, after further review, he had some substance there,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “I’m not finding any particular catalyst out there.”Still, optimism over the economic stimulus package helped the S&P 500 index close 0.8 per cent higher at 833.74. The benchmark index drifted between positive and negative territory in a choppy yet relatively subdued session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.6 per cent at 7,939.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.4 per cent at 1,530.50.The advance in financials came as the heads of eight financial institutions testified about the Treasury rescue plan before a House committee. The KBW Bank Index rallied 6 per cent.Better fourth-quarter results than expected from Marsh & McLennan pushed shares in the insurer 14.4 per cent higher to $21.41 and helped prop up the sector.XL Capital surged 61.4 per cent to $4.68 after the group disclosed plans to let go of 10 per cent of its staff and a cut in its dividend. Standard & Poor’s affirmed key credit ratings.Offsetting the bounce for financials, however, the energy sector was hurt by a sharply lower oil price after release of inventory figures and lost 1.3 per cent overall.The technology sector also underperformed, hit by a downbeat assessment of prospects from Research In Motion. The US-listed shares sank 14.5 per cent to $48.76 after the BlackBerry phone maker warned that fourth-quarter profit would come in at the low end of its targets, signalling the company had sacrificed margins to gain customers.Elsewhere in the sector, Nvidia lost 12.6 per cent to $8.15 after the graphics chip maker disclosed a worse fourth-quarter loss than expected.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said of the downbeat technology news: “These data points are a reason to sell on the surface, although RIM’s volumes are strong and a plus for component demand.”Applied Materials, the computer chip tools maker, warned late on Tuesday that chipmakers would spend 50 per cent less this year for its products. The company also posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of nearly $133m and said it would cut 14 per cent of its workforce, about 2,000 jobs. The shares edged 0.8 per cent higher at $9.77.Also weighing on the market, a report from the commerce department showed that the US trade deficit shrank 4 per cent in December as the global financial crisis cut imports and exports for the fifth consecutive month.On the plus side, shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition, the Bristol-Myers Squibb unit that is the world’s largest maker of infant formula, began trading after it raised $720m, more than expected, in the first US flotation since November. The shares rose 10.1 per cent to $26.43 in their debut session.In the consumer sector, shares in Best Buyadded 1.7 per cent to $29.19 after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction buy” list. The analysts noted that the electronics retailer stood to benefit from the bankruptcy of rival Circuit City.Results from Coca-Cola Enterprises pushed shares in the soft drinks group up 9.6 per cent to $13.10.Yet Nike edged 1.6 per cent lower to $44.31 after the sporting goods group said a global restructuring might result in the loss of 1,400 jobs, or 4 per cent of its workforce globally.Elsewhere, luxury homebuilder Toll Brotherseased 1.1 per cent to $18.37 after it emerged that first-quarter home-building revenue fell by more than half.
601;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-02-05T19:57:25Z;Interoperability: the great enabler;;Global financial markets are in disarray but prospects for innovation in the real economy have never been more robust. Innovations once crafted to stand alone are increasingly built to work together, or “interoperate”.The interoperability quotient, or IQ, of discrete components and systems to influence constructively the behaviour of other systems and components increasingly determines economic value. A low IQ indicates innovation destined to underachieve. Playing well with others, not just ingenuity, has become the new standard for innovation excellence.Look no further than the internet for the inspiration for interoperable innovation. The misunderstood genius of the internet is that interoperability makes “networks of networks” possible. Protocols permitting diverse data to mingle creatively explain why the internet’s influence as a multimedia, multifunctional and multidisciplinary environment for innovation remains unsurpassed.Consider “mash-ups” as a model: Google Maps can easily be mixed and mashed with property, seismic or epidemiological data to produce novel applications that might launch a company or an industry. Greater inter­operability invites greater innovation – and vice versa.But interoperability as a core innovation investment principle extends well beyond the internet into power-grid systems, defence technologies and medical devices. More innovators in more disciplines are investing more in interoperability as both a business and research strategy. Nascent nanotechnologies are being mashed up with biotechnologies. Facebook pages mash up with Global Positioning System mobile phones. Rechargeable batteries can mash up with programmable solar cells. Seemingly disparate devices and disciplines that ordinarily would have zero interest in interoperating creatively, or zero capacity to do so, might find novel relationships cheap and easy. Successful interoperability dramatically cuts the costs, risks and complexities of hooking up.Barriers to interdisciplinary innovation tumble. Favourable economics of interoperable innovation will tempt ambitious “inter-preneurs” to test their ideas.How might interoperability between Siemens cochlear implants, Apple iPhones, Nike running shoe accelerometers, LG microwave ovens, Nintendo Wiis and BMW Series 3 Sedans create bold entrepreneurial, or diversification, opportunities? Who knows? But the fact that the question piques curiosity reveals fundamental changes in the global innovation climate.The interoperability imperative creates a new innovator’s dilemma: will greater market share or profitability come from making one’s innovation more interoperable …or less? What IQ do current customers and potential prospects prefer? How should we collaborate, and compete, in the context of inter­operability?How much interoperability is enough, or too much, is impossible to know in advance. What is easier to anticipate is the growing need for innovators and customers alike to customise the interoperability they offer and use. For ins­tance, this might involve giving people the power to determine whether their cardiac pacemakers should be able to influence their running shoes or allowing the breathalyser in their mobile phone to disable their car’s ignition. Creating cost-effective rules of engagement for customised interoperability will be a fantastic business challenge.Pervasive interoperability in both in­dustrial and consumer markets suggests that a new generation of interfaces will be essential. Simple interfaces that allow access to complex interoperability promise to be the great enabler, or the horrendous bottleneck, to innovation. The incompetent design of video remote control devices will give way to more iPhone-like and Google-esque streamlined access. Interface technologies – whether keyboard, touch-sensitive, voice or visual – will prove crucial to interoperable innovation. Interoperability’s economic potential is stunted without easy ways to gain access to it.Of course, increased interoperability means increased vulnerabilities. The viruses, spam and malware that pollute today’s laptops could crash fuel delivery trucks or implantable insulin pumps tomorrow. Wicked innovators, more than failed inter-preneurial ingenuity, may be the dominant threat to interoperability’s future.Unsurprisingly, as interoperability be­comes the technical locus of innovation strategy worldwide, regulators may feel compelled to enshrine, loosen or shatter market standards. Interoperability standards can create, or destroy, innovation oligopolies and monopolies. Interoperability represents a challenge to competition policies in Europe and America.But where interchangeable parts enabled the mass production era more than a century ago, tomorrow’s interoperable systems promise richer, more diverse and more customisable innovation. Economic historians and post-industrial pundits alike observe that high-impact innovations come less from scientific breakthroughs than from clever recombinations of existing inventions.While trend should never be confused with destiny, interoperability potentially offers the best of both innovation worlds: a medium that gives scientific breakthroughs the opportunity to connect with other disciplines and a method for exploring more combinations more quickly and cheaply. That is a recipe for economic growth in difficult times.The writer researches the economics of innovation at MIT’s Sloan School and at Imperial College’s Business School
602;NKE;Nike Inc;2009-02-01T17:31:50Z;No consensus on restoring trust in business;;Business leaders, stunned by their loss of public trust and fearful of a further backlash, vowed at the weekend to join forces more often in order to share the burden of tackling challenges from shrinking demand to climate change.Wrapping up a week that had begun with surveys showing steep falls in chief executives’ confidence levels and trust in western businesses, industry delegates to Davos struggled to agree on a single answer to the crisis.Prescriptions offered at a session on restoring trust in business ranged from giving audit and compensation committees more teeth to simply demonstrating competence at companies’ core businesses.Most executives agreed that more regulation seemed inevitable, but Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of Telstra, echoed many in his call for new regulations to be limited and designed to give business incentives to invest.Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike, urged his peers to stay focused on the consumer and on sustainable behaviour.Industry delegates meeting at the World Economic Forum had agreed that more collaboration would be necessary, he added.“The theme of last year’s meeting – ‘the power of collaborative innovation’ – contains many of the solutions to the theme of this year’s meeting – ‘shaping the post-crisis world’,” he said.However, Lee McIntire, chief executive of CH2M Hill, an engineering and construction group, said: “Remember, we’re not always right at this conference.“When I was here last year, what I kept thinking was that if I could help my customers with water, energy and sustainability, I’d do really well profit-wise…The world has changed a lot since the last Davos [meeting].”
603;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-12-19T19:04:29Z;Sports Direct-JJB links face increased scrutiny;;"Sports Direct and JJB Sports face more scrutiny from the Office of Fair Trading after the competition watchdog decided to broaden its inquiry about links between the companies.The OFT said it would examine the purchase of stores by Sports Direct, controlled by entrepreneur Mike Ashley, from JJB Sports, its troubled retail peer.Sports Direct’s purchase of shares in JJB is already being examined. Sports Direct owns 4.9 per cent of JJB and controls more via derivatives.Asked this week whether he was concerned about the OFT’s inquiries, Mr Ashley replied: “No.”He told the Financial Times that the sportswear industry was “basically owned by two big brands which are Nike and Adidas” and that Sports Direct’s ownership of strategic stakes was not unusual in the industry.“JD [the third biggest sportswear chain] have 9.9 per cent of voting shares in JJB,” he said.“They are owned in turn by the Rubens. And they genuinely have a lot more bigger, powerful brands than Sports Direct.”Stephen and Angela Ruben and their family own Pentland, a brands group that includes Speedo and owns 57 per cent of JD.The OFT invited interested parties to comment on Sports Direct’s decision this month to pay £3.4m for four JJB stores.JJB is in a race to generate cash to stave off creditors and the money from its rival proved helpful. However, another industry executive pointed out that the deal was a good one for Sports Direct.The watchdog said it was considering whether there was the prospect of a “relevant merger situation” and if that would “result in a substantial lessening of competition”.Together JJB and Sports Direct dominate the market for replica football shirts and sportswear. But there is room to argue over how the market should be defined and Mr Ashley said that “95 per cent of sports shoes are not used for sport”.If the OFT accepts the argument that the companies only have a small fraction of a much broader market they could escape any action even if the watchdog decides they have created a relevant merger situation.Sports Direct said it was co-operating with the OFT; JJB declined to comment."
604;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-11-20T01:27:55Z;Business fights for tougher emissions rules;;Five leading US consumer companies have launched a campaign to press for ambitious regulation designed to combat global warming, as a policy battle looms in Washington over president-elect Barack Obama’s agenda on climate change.The founding members of the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (Bicep) coalition include Nike, Starbucks, Levi Strauss, Timberland and Sun Microsystems.The companies are backing targets that include a proposed US “cap-and-trade” emissions trading system that would be based on auctioning carbon allowances, rather than granting them free to cover a company’s existing emissions.The group also wants an end to the building of new coal-fired power plants that do not capture and store carbon emissions, and aggressive targets for both emissions reduction and the development of renewable energy sources.The objectives go far beyond those of the US Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), hitherto the main business voice on climate change policy issues.USCAP, launched in January last year, supports the introduction of carbon limits and trading. But it was set up by energy companies and industrial manufacturers such as GE and Alcoa that would be directly affected by new regulations, and reflects their views.Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the environmental advocacy group that helped organise the Bicep coalition, said its members wanted to bring an additional business perspective to the debate.“These are consumer companies that reach millions of people a day. I think this group dug in and took a hard look, and decided that a stronger public policy position was needed from the business sector,” she said.Mr Obama said on Tuesday that the US would “engage vigorously” in climate change talks and pledged, despite the financial crisis, to stick to plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2020. He has said he will set annual targets that would reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 per cent below by 2050. In contrast, the new Bicep coalition is calling for emissions to be 25 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, with the same 2050 target.USCAP wants far more modest targets. It also argues that “a significant portion” of emission allowances should initially be distributed free.Ben Packard, head of corporate responsibility at Starbucks, said the company had been highlighting the potential threat from climate change for several years.● Europe’s first auction of carbon dioxide permits took place on Wednesday, with the UK government reaping about £54m ($81m) from sales of 4m allowances to emit carbon under the European Union’s emissions trading scheme.The permits fetched £13.60 per tonne in an auction that was four times oversubscribed.Electricity producers were expected to be the main buyers, as they had their free allocation of permits cut by 30 per cent in the current phase of the EU scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012.
605;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Europe faces paradox of cheap shares with need for cash;;Companies are facing a deep paradox over their share buy-back programmes.On the one hand, companies’ share prices are on average far cheaper than they have been for years, making buying their own stock an attractive way of propping up market value.But at the same time the dominant corporate mantra right now is: preserve cash at all costs, including stopping buy-backs.“Both are true. Cash is king but your shares are massively under value so you should buy now. Both are conflicting, so which prevails?” asks Feike Sijbesma, chief executive of DSM, the Dutch life sciences group.His answer – to slow down DSM’s programme – is the response that has been widely seen in the past six months in the US.But, surprisingly, the trend in the third quarter in Europe and the UK was for more buy-backs, not fewer.Citigroup analysts show that in Europe the return of capital – mostly buy-backs but also special dividends and redemption shares – increased in the three months until the end of September from €25.8bn ($32.3bn) in the second quarter to €29bn.That was below the level of the third quarter in 2007, but still one of the highest levels ever recorded.Adrian Cattley, European equities strategist at Citi, says European companies have more long-term buyback programmes, while UK groups have done them often around disposals.Both are expected to slow in the coming months. “If you are going to rein in your spending, the first thing to go is discretionary spending and that will mean buy-backs before dividends,” he says.Pierre-Jean Sivignon, chief financial officer of Philips, bears that out, saying the Dutch industrial conglomerate has slowed its own programme down in part because “cash is king”.Philips will complete its €5bn of buy-backs, but at a slower pace to allow it to take advantage of other opportunities, he says. “We are taking back the flexibility on completion. We could buy back, we could slow down, we could do something else like M&A possibilities.”Acquisition possibilities were also behind the decision by GlaxoSmithKline, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, to slow its buyback programme over the summer.Andrew Witty, chief executive, says he feels even better now about the decision after the financial crisis started to affect the real economy. “[The slowing of the programme] is to make sure that we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities for investment in the business. That might for example include some bolt-on acquisitions,” he says.Not all companies are taking this tack, however. Some of the largest groups in Europe and the US are starting buy-back programmes or stepping up existing ones.Microsoft has announced a $40bn programme, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle $8bn each, and Nike and Abbott Laboratories $5bn each. In Europe, KPN, Telefónica and German builder Hochtief increased buy-back plans.Abbott said at the time that it was “a significant buying opportunity”.Ad Scheepbouwer, chief executive of KPN, the Dutch telecoms group whose shares are down 18 per cent this year, says: “Our financing is really well organised and if you look at the price of the shares …we should start as soon as we can.”Mr Cattley agrees, saying that Warren Buffett’s use of his own money to invest in General Electric and Goldman Sachs shows how long-term investors should act: “With the benefit of a very long-term horizon, companies should invest in equity, either their own or others.”Underlying all this is a feeling that the value of cash has increased, no matter what you spend it on.As Mr Sivignon at Philips says: “I think the value of €1 of cash is certainly more than it was six months ago.” That means cash-rich companies are in the luxurious position of deciding whether to buy back shares or snap up cheaper rivals.For those companies with a poor cash position, however, it is a time to cut investments and costs and look for disposals.As in the entire playing-out of the financial crisis, the fact that US companies are cutting buy-backs ahead of Europeans show how the effects from the credit crunch are being worked through faster in America. The market fell there first.As Mr Cattley says: “In the end it is to do with the animal spirits of managers. M&A peaks at the peak of the cycle and buy-backs are just another manifestation of that.”
606;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-10-28T19:32:30Z;Markets;;Where have all the buyers gone? As stock markets round the world are crushed by the big unwind, few investors seem willing to buy on the mother of all dips, not even the usual buyers of last resort.Insurance companies, as it turns out, were ahead of the game. The likes of Aviva and Aegon have been steadily reducing their equity exposure. They are presumably not filling their boots now. What of their customers, though? Aviva, reporting on Tuesday, had resilient sales in life and pensions and long-term savings. But it seems fair to wonder whether, in the short term, consumers will be more focused on keeping cash in hand as they worry more about jobs than equity exposure. As for retail investors, they have probably been shocked into paralysis by a second stock market wipe-out in 10 years. For the moment, it is also rational for them to hang on to cash. The returns may be minimal and falling, but as an asset class, it will not give them a heart-attack on a daily basis.Then there are asset managers. Hedge funds are cashed up, but unlikely to plunge in: redemptions and sinking performance could shrink the industry’s assets by 25 to 30 per cent in the second half of 2008, according to Morgan Stanley. Outflows from European equity mutual funds could exceed €100bn this year, according to Citigroup.Pension funds could feel tempted to rebalance portfolios since the stock market fall will have left them looking underweight in equities. But equally, their appetite for equity-type risk has also probably diminished. Sovereign wealth funds from Beijing to Kuwait have their own problems.That leaves governments – which are already doing their bit by buying into banks – and companies with strong balance sheets. Some, like the energy group BG, have launched takeovers. Others, such as Microsoft, Nike and Oracle, plan to buy back stock. But many more will prefer to hoard cash given how expensive debt raising has become.The cash is there, but it will remain sidelined until the shadow of systemic risk is gone. It feels like a long time passing.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
607;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-10-06T19:26:30Z;Credit insurer withdrawal hits JJB;;JJB Sports shares fell by a quarter after one of the UK’s biggest credit insurers said it would not provide cover to its suppliers, while another leading credit insurer said it was also in discussions with the struggling sports retailer.As Coface confirmed it would definitely not supply such cover for the foreseeable future, its rival Atradius told the Financial Times it was in discussions with JJB about the strength of the sportswear chain’s balance sheet. It did not provide further details.Atradius has said previously that it was looking to cut its exposure to the troubled UK retail sector.Suppliers often have to wait for up to 90 days to be paid for goods supplied to retailers and they take out credit insurance as cover against the non-payment of goods they have already dispatched.Credit insurance is used typically to offer protection against the risk of insolvency.One retail executive said losing credit cover was not a critical issue for JJB, pointing out that losing credit insurance would have little impact on global suppliers such as Nike and Adidas.However, the shares fell 9¼p, or more than 25 per cent, to close at 27p after Coface’s announcement, leaving JJB valued at just £64.5m. The shares have fallen more than 80 per cent in the past year.JJB said the Coface decision “has no affect on our business”.The moves by the two credit insurers come after JJB announced a £9.7m half-year loss on September 26, triggering a warning from auditors Deloitte & Touche about the company’s viability as a going concern.JJB has recently agreed a bridging loan with Kaupthing, the Icelandic bank, as an additional source of funding on top of credit facilities with both Barclays and HBOS. JJB is in dispute with HBOS as to whether or not it has breached its covenants on that facility.Trading in shares in Kaupthing and other Icelandic banks were suspended on Monday amid concerns about the country’s worsening financial outlook.Baugur, the Icelandic investment company that owns much of the UK’s high street, is also in discussions with credit insurer Euler Hermes over a number of its retail chains.Euler Hermes UK said its discussions with Baugur continued and that it was seeking more information from the investment company before deciding whether to withdraw cover from some parts of the business.Baugur, meanwhile, said it believed Euler Hermes had taken the decision to review its coverage because of what was happening to the wider Icelandic economy, adding that it was “confident” that a solution would be found.The investment company said: “We have stated clearly that Baugur’s portfolio companies have no exposure to the Icelandic economy, the vast majority are funded by international banks and are performing well in the current market conditions.”Retailers played down the withdrawal of credit insurance on Monday, arguing that it had a bigger impact on smaller suppliers whose own credit lines are sometimes dependent on insurance being in place.
608;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
609;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-09-27T00:50:10Z;Wall Street wreckage washes up on west coast;;Ian Yolles, an entrepreneur living in Oregon, has felt the whiplash from Wall Street’s hyper-volatile credit markets at first hand.A self-described news junkie, the former Nike marketing executive used to have what he calls a “conceptual and intellectual” interest in keeping up with the economy and the financial markets. “Then suddenly, all this stuff I’d been reading about was frighteningly real.”The outdoor clothing company Mr Yolles had helped found was the epitome of progressive Pacific Northwest cool. Called Nau, it combined rugged outdoor practicality, the pursuit of high style and a devotion to sustainability that extended to making all its clothes out of recycled plastic bottles.It took Wall Street’s financing boom to float this West Coast dream – and just as swiftly to wreck it. Half of the $35m (€24m, £19m) behind what Mr Yolles admits was a highly ambitious venture came from a private equity firm and a hedge fund. When the financiers had to draw in their horns this year, bankruptcy came swiftly.In hindsight, the credit market dislocation that helped to lay Mr Yolles’s company low was just a warning tremor ahead of the far larger earthquake that has struck this month. The resulting institutional meltdown on Wall Street has sown confusion and anxiety on the other side of the continent. It has also provoked deep distrust of the financial system that has supported America’s long prosperity.“I think it’s incredibly frightening: it seems that the financial system has become so arcane and so complex that no one understands it,” says Mr Yolles. The collapse on Thursday of Washington Mutual, the giant thrift association that has a big presence in the city, has brought the reality of financial dislocation home.At a glance, Portland remains the picture of genteel provincial prosperity, a city of half a million that has risen on the back of thriving industries such as electronics and an influx of Californians migrating from the south. As Mr Yolles sits in the Daily Café, a vegetarian haunt among the former warehouses and industrial lofts of the newly gentrified Pearl district, the distant financial upheaval seems far away.Scratch the surface, however, and the anxiety late this week was palpable. Jon Gaston, an elder of the Presbyterian church and former chairman of the Republican party in nearby Clark county, says the generally elderly members of his congregation had already been feeling the financial stress. “A lot of us are living on social security and pensions and dipping into our investments,” he says. With the financial markets heading south, the church will end in deficit this year. The financial collapse has added a new and frightening twist. Like others, Mr Gaston displays a strong optimism born of the sustained expansion. But he also voices a deeper dread: “There is without question a real concern: is the market going to go bust?”Contemplating the unimaginable in this way has become the norm. With no means to assess the likelihood that the debacle will turn into a steep decline, anxious bemusement prevails. “When we hear things like, ‘There will be a depression by Monday,’ what are we meant to think?” says Dick Aanderud, a partner in Waterleaf, an architectural firm.As they struggle to understand how deeply Wall Street’s malaise will affect their investments and local economy, there is one strongly shared sentiment: that irresponsible deregulation and a lack of control allowed greed to take over. The arcane ways of the modern markets may leave the average middle-class investor perplexed but there is no doubt about the results.“There was layer on layer on layer put on top of these investments,” Tom Whittaker, another Waterleaf partner, says of the huge leverage that eventually sank the investment banking business. “It’s not real. It has created a lot of wealth for people without changing the underlying investment.”Tim Hibbitts, a partner in Davis Hibbitts & Midghall, the Portland polling firm, puts it more bluntly: “People think that people on Wall Street are walking away with tens of millions while they are being screwed.”The fear and loathing precipitated by Wall Street’s implosion has also become a catalyst for a deeper anxiety. The economic boom that has continued almost uninterrupted for the past quarter of a century has enabled Portland, like a string of other regional centres, to emerge with greater confidence. But there are more voices now questioning whether this is sustainable – a view that reverberates all the more strongly in a city with a strong liberal leaning.“We have been living beyond our means for a long time. The chickens have come home to roost,” says Mr Hibbitts.The proposed Wall Street bail-out itself has become the latest focus of this angst. “To go in a matter of weeks from free-market capitalism where anything goes, to almost corporate socialism, is unbelievable,” says Mr Yolles. “The stature and the role of the US in the world is not what it was 10 years ago. This is like another nail in the coffin.”
610;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-09-22T22:01:19Z;Sportswear boss faces marathon turnround;;"Just after Mike Ashley hoisted the “for sale” sign on Newcastle United Football Club, his friend and rival Chris Ronnie bounds into JJB headquarters in Wigan, tie unfastened around his neck.His office contains intriguing evidence of how his role as chief executive of JJB Sports began. A faded framed receipt for lunch – £15.70 – recalls his meeting at Rigoletto’s, the improbably named restaurant at the JJB stadium in Wigan where Dave Whelan agreed to sell the 29 per cent stake in the retailer he founded.“Not bad to get him over the line,” chuckles Mr Ronnie.A screen contains a handful of stock tickers – JJB (down sharply with the market in the wake of the financial crisis), Sports Direct (the empire of Mr Ashley, a former employer of Mr Ronnie), John David Group (whose JD Sports chain is third in the UK’s sports retail triumvirate).How long will JJB remain on the board?One of the more obvious deals in retail is for Mr Ronnie and Exista, his Icelandic partner, to make an offer for the 71 per cent of JJB they do not own. His cards are played close to his chest. But one of those cards, say people who know Mr Ronnie, has “JJB bid” written on it: the question is when to play it.As an investment, JJB has so far proved to be a poor deal for Mr Ronnie and Exista – while the sale of his stake has proved to be timely for Mr Whelan. Since the purchase at 275p a share, or £190m, in June 2007, the stock has fallen almost 60 per cent, in line with the general retail sector.“My mum always said to me ‘life’s all about timing’ – and I’ve got to tell you, Tom, mine is shite,” says Mr Ronnie. That does not mean he is downhearted – this was never a short-term share gamble – but he is frustrated not to be able to enjoy immediate benefits from the steps he has taken.The 46-year-old has spent his first year in charge buying and decluttering. In have come brands such as Champion, and Mr Ronnie says he will buy more in the coming months. Sports Direct – with its own labels such as Dunlop, Slazenger and Karrimor – has shown that there are huge gross margin benefits to having a roster of brands rather than relying on the big two of Adidas and Nike.Gone from the Wigan headquarters is a bicycle showroom; in its place is a training centre for managers. Gone are a handful of middle managers who were not prepared for the cut-and-thrust of the Ronnie era. Soon after his arrival last year, Mr Ronnie was unhappy to be locked in the building in the early evening because everyone else had gone home.“He’s pretty inspirational,” says Roger Lane-Smith, chairman, claiming that Mr Ronnie electrified a conference of store managers. “Mind you, that might have had something to do with the cars that were given away.”A five-a-side football venture has been sold. Most important, stock has gone – out of warehouses, into trucks, into stores and sold. He will sacrifice margin in the short term rather than be left with a mass of depreciating out-of-date merchandise. Unprofitable stores are being closed and tired ones are being refitted. And out have gone the “shop in shops”, areas devoted to Adidas and Nike.They failed and while Mr Ronnie’s relationship with the brands is all important, he will not let them dictate the lay-out of his shops.The no-nonsense approach was learnt during Mr Ronnie’s past at Sports Direct, where he worked for Mr Ashley; Umbro, the brand that was acquired by Nike last year; and Sports Division, the chain owned by Sir Tom Hunter before its sale to JJB in 1998. “If I can’t learn from Tom and Mike I must be a numpty,” says Mr Ronnie, with some modesty and a hint of his Scottish background that is absent from his accent.What he lacked under both the retail entrepreneurs was autonomy. “I’d always said to Mike that I would love to work for myself,” he says.With Mr Ashley ready to float his empire in autumn 2006, Mr Ronnie was faced with the option of being locked into a senior role at Sports Direct or striking out on his own. Having chosen the latter, he has arrived at the beginning of a retail slowdown and the fixes introduced – widely welcomed by analysts and applauded in the industry – are not short term.The energy appears undimmed but Mr Ronnie faces tough times at JJB, whether it is as chief executive or owner."
611;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-09-22T20:44:09Z;US stocks plunge as scepticism grows;;Regional banks were among the hardest hit from mounting scepticism over the extent to which Washington’s proposed $700bn Wall Street bail-out would resuscitate the crisis-hit financial sector.Regions Financial, Marshall & Ilsley and Huntington – all of which surged last week when news of the government plan surfaced – sustained heavy losses, down 21.2 per cent at $15.60, 22.6 per cent at $22.82 and 23.1 per cent at $9.81 respectively.JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients: “Our initial impression of the plan is that the benefits to the regional banks would be indirect in nature.”The broader market sank as anxiety over the details of the Treasury’s plan to mop up toxic mortgage assets replaced last week’s relief.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients: “Important details of this plan remain unclear, including the pricing mechanism, the amount of mortgage assets that can be sold by each banking institution, and ultimately, the cost that these institutions would incur.”Oil’s extraordinary jump – at one point to $130 a barrel – sparked inflation concerns and hurt automotive, airline and consumer-facing stocks in particular. The rebound helped energy stocks escape the worst declines, although the sector still closed firmly in negative territory, down 1.1 per cent.Yet the market decline was once again led by financials, which fell 7.2 per cent amid uncertainty over the impact of its biggest restructuring since the Great Depression. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup fell, 13.2 per cent at $40.80, 8.9 per cent at $34.15 and 3.1 per cent at $20.01 respectively.In the latest in a series of of extraordinary developments, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are to abandon their investment bank model and become traditional bank holding companies. Morgan Stanley edged down down 0.4 per cent to $27.09 after Goldman, meanwhile, fell 7 per cent to $120.78The S&P 500 closed 3.8 per cent lower at 1,207.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.3 per cent lower at 11,015.69 while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 4.2 per cent to 2,178.98.The prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off a deepening financial crisis led to a two-day rally at the end of last week, helped by a temporary ban on shorting some financial stocks.“Armageddon appears to have been avoided but are the events of the past week to be seen as an armistice or a plain simple truce? I’ll go for an armistice, mindful that history tells us that not even these always hold,” said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC Brokers.Outside financials, Real Estate Investment Trusts and homebuilders sustained particularly heavy losses. General Growth Properties sank 25 per cent to $16.08 after saying it may need to raise capital.General Motors’ inclusion on the short ban list afforded the stock scant comfort. Fitch downgraded its junk debt rating even further, pushing the shares down 11.5 per cent at $11.58.General Electric and American Express also slid, in spite of their addition to the SEC list. They fell 1.2 per cent at $26.15 and 7.7 per cent at $37.29 respectively.Among the few brightspots, Microsoft edged up 1 per cent to $25.40 after the software group raised its quarterly dividend and unveiled plans to buy back as much as $40bn of its stock.Yet Nike and Hewlett-Packard’s share buy-backs failed to lift those stocks into positive territory. Nike fell 0.9 per cent to $63.15 in spite of news of a $5bn repurchase programme. Hewlett-Packard increased its share buy-back programme by $8bn, although the shares lost 2.3 per cent at $47.16.Also in technology, Morgan Stanley cut its price target on several hardware stocks, including Apple and Cisco. They fell 7 per to $131.05 per cent and 4.9 per cent to $23.11 respectively.Morgan Stanley cited the dollar and “additional signs of slowing global demand . . . We expect companies to guide to worse than normal revenue growth for the December quarter”.Amazon.com fell 7.5 per cent to $37.29 and Priceline.com 7.7 per cent to $82.15 after Citigroup said the two were the internet stocks most exposed to dollar appreciation.

Nike founder and chairman Philip Knight, and a 1962 MBA alumnus has given the school $105m towards the new building, which is to be named the Knight Management Center.“My hope is that this new campus will enable future generations of students to have the life-changing experience I had at Stanford Business School,” says Mr Knight.“If there was no Stanford Graduate School of Business there would be no Nike. The idea for a business really never took form until I took that small business management course. It was out of that I had the encouragement and enthusiasm to start Nike.”The new campus will comprise eight buildings around three quadrangles and will include flexible classroom space and breakout rooms to accommodate the increase in classes and programmes in the school’s new MBA curriculum launched earlier this year.The design aims to engage more students in cross-disciplinary experiences involving Stanford University’s schools of engineering, earth sciences, medicine, law, education and humanities and sciences.“Leading universities of the 21st century need business schools that foster extraordinary intellectual innovation and collaboration,” says dean of Stanford GSB, Robert Joss.“This new campus provides the physical infrastructure to enable that academic vision to come to life.”www.gsb.stanford.edu
613;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-08-17T19:33:50Z;Bolt gives Puma headstart in sales;;As Usain Bolt held up one of his gold-decked running shoes for the cameras after his historic 100m victory, the Jamaican sprinter struck a blow in another battle for supremacy.Bolt’s domination of his rivals fulfilled his pre-race tag as favourite, but for Puma, the German sportswear manufacturer whose Theseus II spikes he was wearing, it was a triumph for an underdog.Puma came to Beijing nowhere near rivals Nike and Adidas in terms of market value and sales, trailing in the number of Olympic athletes contracted to wear its apparel, and behind in the race for a share of the lucrative Chinese market.But Puma does have Bolt, who goes for two more golds this week. The sight of the fastest man alive lapping up the crowd’s adulation in what may have been the most watched sporting moment of the most watched sporting event of the year gives the company the kind of marketing kick that will have had its rivals quietly fuming.The 100m final was billed as a showdown between Bolt, his fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay, the US world champion, who failed to qualify for the race. But with Bolt signed to Puma, Powell with Nike and Gay with Adidas, it was more than just a running race. “It was a great allusion to the footwear wars,” says Larry Eder, who runs Running Network, an athletics website.The reasoning goes that the company with the most athletes on its books gets the most medals and therefore the better marketing opportunities. Not necessarily so, says Joerg Sobel, Puma’s general manager in the Asia Pacific region. “You don’t have to have the biggest number of athletes, you have to have the right ones.”As a driver of sportswear sales, the Olympic 100m final is on a level above most other sporting events and, according to Mr Eder, there was “a huge battle” between Puma and Nike to sign up the current crop of talented Jamaican sprinters.“Puma had the Jamaican federation [signed up], but most of the individual athletes signed up to Nike,” he says. “The only athlete Puma kept was Bolt.”Bolt’s victory is the second blow at these games for Adidas and Nike. They began with the thrilling sight of Li Ning, China’s former Olympic champion gymnast, circling the roof of the Bird’s Nest stadium and lighting the Olympic flame.It was more chilling than thrilling for Adidas, official Olympic sponsor and linked to Yao Ming, China’s 7ft 5in basketball star, and Nike, as they watched Li, the founder of the eponymous Chinese sportswear company, pulling off one of the more brazen acts in the history of ambush marketing.Privately, Adidas executives sniff at Puma’s good fortune. “This industry is a two-horse race, and in China it’s a two-horse race for market leadership,” said one executive. Still, Jan Runau of Adidas agrees it would love to have signed Bolt. They had Gay instead. “That’s what you get with sport,” he says.Nike has deals with 22 Chinese Olympic teams, and promotes Liu Xiang, China’s big hope in the 110m hurdles. It has been pouring resources into signing budding talent, but as Charlie Brooks of Nike says: “You have to hope that they can live up to their talent.”
614;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-08-08T20:41:00Z;US stocks rally as oil prices fall;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Friday, and made their first consecutive weekly gains since May, after a dip in oil prices offset weak results and a dividend cut from Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage agency.Crude oil fell more than $4 a barrel to a three-month low on Friday, taking its tally for the week to a 5.7 per cent decline.Oil-sensitive stocks rallied strongly on the news. General Motors advanced 2.9 per cent to $10.03 and Ford rose 7.6 per cent to $5.23. Retailers Macy’s and JC Penney climbed 9.5 per cent to $20.73 and 6.6 per cent to $35.75 respectively. An index of airline stocks added 8.2 per cent and the consumer staples and discretionary sectors advanced 2.3 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.McDonald’s added to the positive momentum. The restaurant company posted July sales that rose significantly more than analysts estimated thanks to a strong performance in Europe. The shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $65.67 and a 43-year high.The industrial sector also made some notable headway, climbing 3.3 per cent. UPS rallied 3.8 per cent to $65.65 while General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.64.Financials were in focus after Fannie Mae, the biggest US mortgage-finance agency, reported a wider- than-expected loss of $2.3bn – its fourth quarterly loss in a row. Earlier in the week, fellow government-sponsored entity Freddie Mac reported a loss that was three times wider than analysts anticipated, prompting concerns that the company would have to raise fresh capital.Fannie fell 9.1 per cent to $9.05 while Freddie rose 0.2 per cent to $5.90 on Friday. The pair are down 23.4 per cent and 26.1 per cent over the week.Separately, MBIA, the beleaguered bond insurer, posted a $1.7bn profit in second-quarter net income thanks to an accounting change. MBIA shares, which have lost more than 90 per cent of their value in the last year, added 3.5 per cent to $8.57. Ambac Financial Group, a peer that reported a $5.2bn gain on accounting changes on Wednesday, fell 5.7 per cent to $4.33.The financial sector focused on the positive and rose 3.5 per cent, turning weekly losses into a 1 per cent gain.Nine of the 10 leading industry groups closed ahead, helping the benchmark S&P 500 index climb 2.4 per cent to 1,296.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.7 per cent to 11,734.32 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,414.1.Over the week, the S&P 500 climbed 2.9 per cent for its biggest gain since April. A rapid decline in oil prices, a swathe of earnings reports that were for the most part positive and a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 per cent, all played a part. The Dow rose 3.6 per cent over the week while the Nasdaq gained 4.4 per cent.The sector rallied 6 per cent over the week, after Cisco reported some solid earnings and analysts upgraded some key semiconductor companies.Cisco rose 10.3 per cent to $24.25 during the week, while Intel added 8.4 per cent to $24.23 and Sun Microsystems rallied 9.8 per cent to $10.25.Over the week consumer discretionary and staples stocks were also solid performers, making gains of 7.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively as the headwinds of rising commodity prices abated.Materials and energy stocks were the laggards over the week, falling 2 per cent and 4 per cent as commodity prices slipped back. The two sectors, which were the best performers in the first half of the year, are among the worst performers in the second half to date.The Olympics kicked off on Friday and that could be a positive for Nike, the athletic goods company.According to Bloomberg data, during the last six summer games, Nike shares have gained an average of 8.7 per cent. Nike shares rose 3.5 per cent to $62.95 on Friday.
615;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-08-08T14:06:19Z;China welcomes the world;;China pulled off a diplomatic triumph on Friday, turning the Olympic opening ceremony from the low-key political event it has traditionally been into a spectacular visual display attended by a roll call of world leaders.Underlining China’s growing global presence, more than 50 presidents and prime ministers attended the lavishly choreographed ceremony in Beijing’s “bird’s nest” stadium. They included George W. Bush, the first US president to attend an opening ceremony outside the United States, Russia’s prime minister Vladimir Putin and Japan’s prime minister Yasuo Fukuda.Earlier in the day, the leaders queued in a half-hour-long receiving line to be photographed alongside Hu Jintao, China’s president, with a painting of the Great Wall as a backdrop.Alongside the grand opening ceremony, which was watched by an estimated 4bn television viewers, the images were designed to show China’s emerging international status to the world and the continuing legitimacy of the Communist party government at home. The Chinese authorities have pursued diplomacy and occasional threats to persuade as many leaders as possible to come to Beijing.With human rights groups lobbying leaders to steer clear of the Games, there were some notable absentees, including Angela Merkel of Germany and Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who called off his visit a few weeks ago citing the summer heat in Beijing. Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, is due to attend the closing ceremony.However, French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who had flirted with the idea of a boycott after the March turmoil over Tibet, did attend.Mr Bush, who talked about the situation in South Ossetia with Mr Putin, urged China to increase political and religious freedoms. “We strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful,” he said at a ceremony to open the new US embassy in Beijing.Olympic organisers injected a note of business competition into the proceedings by choosing former gymnast and entrepreneur Li Ning as the athlete to light the Olympic cauldron. As well as winning three gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles games, he is the founder of the Li Ning sporting goods company, a serious rival to Nike and Adidas in the Chinese market.While the Chinese authorities offered a warm welcome to international leaders, they were taking no chances with potential dissent. Four dissidents contacted by the Financial Times said they had been all but consigned to their homes during the Games.
616;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-08-06T00:11:53Z;Adidas claims inside lane ahead of Olympics;;Adidas, the world’s second-largest sporting goods company, on Tuesday boasted of its confidence for the rest of the year after strong sales growth in emerging markets lifted its profits in the first half.Just three days before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games, Adidas slightly increased its profit margin expectations for the full year.The German company is an official provider of sportswear for the 2008 Olympic Games.Robin Stalker, chief financial officer of Adidas, said he expected a gross margin of more than 48 per cent compared with a previous forecast between 47.5 and 48 per cent.He also lifted the company’s sales target at its Adidas brand after the European Championships football competition this year boosted sales in the first half.Adidas sponsored both the finalists – Germany and Spain – at Euro 2008 and now expects its football sales to reach €1.3bn ($2bn) in the full year, more than it originally forecast.“We continue to have high expectations for our brands – even in the light of some tougher economic trends,” Mr Stalker said.The comments come after Adidas exceeded market expectations with its second-quarter results.Net profit rose 12 per cent to €116m in spite of heavy investment in marketing for Euro 2008 and the forthcoming Olympics.Revenues increased by 5 per cent to €2.52bn, pushed by some very strong sales in Asia, Latin America and Europe.But the company’s US business cast a shadow on Adidas’s performance. Sales in the region declined more than 20 per cent, led by a fall in revenues at the Reebok brand.US rival Nike last month reported sluggish sales growth in North America as the housing and credit crisis hit consumers there.Adidas is chasing Nike’s crown as the world’s biggest sporting goods producer. It also hopes to use the Olympics to surpass Nike as market leader in China.Mr Stalker said Adidas remained cautious on expectations for America, but this was more than compensated for by sales growth in the rest of the world, in particular in the emerging countries.“We are enjoying tremendous growth in other markets.”The integration of a joint venture in Latin America helped Reebok post its first overall revenue increase in more than a year.Reebok’s order backlog – a measure for future growth in the industry – fell 13 per cent.Analysts said this figure gave limited insight, however, because orders through Reebok’s own retail channels were not included.“We still have a way to go in this segment,” Mr Stalker said.The Adidas share price climbed more than 7 per cent to €41.11.
617;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-07-03T02:09:40Z;Brickfish aiming to use viral adverts;;When Kodak, the US photo supplies company, decided to re-enter the inkjet printer business with a range of printers that claim to cut the cost of ink in half, the company chose an unconventional way to get the message out.Kodak teamed up with a San Diego-based start-up called Brickfish that has pioneered a new web-based viral marketing method called social media advertising.Together they created a campaign dubbed ‘Pricey Ink Stinks’ built around a competition that challenged online visitors to find another use for their old, ink-hungry printer and blog about it, take a photo, draw it or video it for the chance to win one of the new Kodak models.The campaign was a success, generating 87 entries and more than 173,022 ‘engagements’ which Brian Dunn, Brickfish’s chief executive, claims are a much better metric than unique visitors or page views. Engagements, or a campaign’s ‘E-score’, measures consumer action defined by entries, votes, reviews, and views of branded user generated content.Clients use the Brickfish platform to launch online advertising and marketing campaigns designed to capture the attention of consumers – particularly the young, creative and connected – and tap the power and reach of social networking.Instead of marketing to consumers, the Brickfish advertising platform effectively co-opts consumers who become part of the campaign, generating blogs, images, video and audio content that is shared virally and voted upon. Meanwhile, Brickfish enables its clients to monitor and track the campaign through ‘viral map’ technology that provides detailed analytics about campaign reach, performance and demographics.“This viral, consumer driven, marketing approach has proven to be five to 10 times more effective than existing online advertising methods such as display ads and search optimisation,” claims Mr Dunn.With online banner ads stuck with their 0.1-0.2 per cent click-through rates, marketers at big name companies including Samsung, Nike, Qualcomm and Procter & Gamble have begun to listen.P&G used Brickfish to launch a campaign for its Aussie shampoo brand. Like the Kodak campaign, the Aussie effort was a contest site. The competition attracted 4,017 entries and more than 2m visitors, 80 per cent of whom were viral connections through sites such as MySpace, MyYearBook and SugarFoot. Brian Jochum, P&G’s Aussie brand manager, described it as one of P&G’s most successful engagement branding efforts so far this year.“In order to broadly reach consumers across the internet, Brickfish provided us with a highly cost conscious and effective method to virally spread our brand name to thousands,” he said. “We were able to reach more active consumers than with many traditional online advertising methods.”Using Brickfish’s media platform, P&G was able to track not only the initial message sent but subsequent ones to other social networks. This enabled the company to follow the viral path from one peer to the next – a colour-coded viral map shows the initial messages that were generated on the contest site and then messages that were later passed on from one social network to the next.In total, Brickfish has launched more than 200 campaigns for clients, including about 30 for the fashion and cosmetics industry. Some of the brands the company has worked with include Givenchy, Frederick’s of Hollywood, Estee Lauder’s Clinique and Origins brands, and Smashbox.Brickfish, which was founded three years ago by a small team of entrepreneurs, has quickly emerged as the leader in social media advertising with few if any direct competitors, though that could change.Last year it raised $11.2m in a Series A financing from a group of venture capital firms including DCM, Draper Richards, Mangrove Capital Partners and OCA Venture Partners. The company is expected to launch another round of funding shortly.
618;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-30T19:57:07Z;Nike plans Olympic advert blitz in China;;Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing company, on Monday said an advertising blitz around this summer’s Beijing Olympics will not be affected by efforts to curtail “ambush marketing” by non-Olympic sponsors.Charlie Denson, Nike’s brand president, said during the Olympics, Nike would launch “a pretty prominent campaign that will run in China. It will run in all the different media vehicles”.While Adidas, its global rival, has invested millions in being an official sponsor of both the Beijing and the 2012 London Olympics, Nike has continued a strategy of sponsoring individual athletes and sports federations.In Beijing, 22 Chinese Olympic teams will be wearing Nike shoes or uniforms in sports ranging from wushu to wrestling. The brand is also sponsoring leading Chinese athletes, including Liu Xiang, a gold medalist hurdler at the 2004 Athens Olympics.Mr Denson said the close relationship with the Olympic federations, which have included designing the company’s first riding boot for the Chinese Olympic Equestrian Federation, had ensured “very fruitful conversations across that landscape”.“We’re not looking at any relationship issues with regards to the Chinese government, or the Olympic committee itself,” over Nike’s promotional efforts, he said.Efforts to control marketing by non-sponsors have become part of the modern Olympics. Beijing Olympic committee marketing officials have said local media would be advised against allowing advertising from non-Olympic sponsors.China Central TV and Li Ning, a local sportswear brand that is not an Olympic sponsor, have reportedly suspended a deal under which presenters and guests would have worn Li Ning’s clothing in CCTV’s studios during the games.China is the second largest country market after the US for Nike, as well as being a significant source of manufacturing for its shoes.Its annual sales there increased 50 per cent in its last fiscal year which ended on 31 May, to surpass $1bn.Nike also distributes its products through stores in some 300 Chinese cities, that Mr Denson said would be used to promote its Olympic-related goods.Mr Denson declined to estimate Nike’s likely marketing spend on the games, or the uplift in sales expected from the event itself.He also played down the expected decision by some of Nike’s leading sponsored swimmers to opt to wear the innovative LZR one-piece bodysuit developed by its rival, Speedo, during the games.
619;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-26T20:41:33Z;Dow at lowest level since September 2006;;"Spiking crude oil prices, poor corporate earnings and more bad news from the banking sector sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling to its lowest level since September 2006 and knocked the S&P 500 below 1,300 points on Thursday.Technology stocks were hit particularly hard after Oracle and Research in Motion disappointed markets late on Wednesday with forecasts of slower growth and a profits miss, respectively.Oracle declined 5 per cent to $21.42 and RIM 13.3 per cent to $123.46 while the technology sector as a whole slumped 3.6 per cent – its biggest one-day fall since early January.Fourth-quarter results from Nike added to the gloom as the group reported a drop in US profits because of higher spending on advertising. Nike shares fell 9.8 per cent to $59.50.The broader consumer discretionary sector fell back sharply, losing 3.5 per cent as oil prices jumped above $140 a barrel.General Motors shares also suffered, falling 10.8 per cent to $11.43 – touching their lowest levels since 1955 along the way – after Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in the carmaker. A similar downgrade for Lear, the maker of car seats, sheared 16.4 per cent from its share price taking it to $15.15.Analysts now expect second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Goldman struck again in the financials sector with a note that added Citigroup to its “conviction sell” list on the basis that it might take as much as $9bn in writedowns in the second quarter.Goldman also cut its recommendation on brokerages from “attractive” to “neutral”, citing deteriorating fundamentals and a delayed recovery process, and forecast $4.2bn of second-quarter writedowns at Merrill Lynch.Citigroup hit its lowest level since 1998, down 6.3 per cent to $17.67. Merrill Lynch dropped to a five-year low, falling 6.8 per cent to $33.05.The financial sector as a whole lost 4.4 per cent while an index of investment banking stocks fell 4.8 per cent.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “When you mix up the higher oil prices and the weakness in financials it continues to push this market lower …without question the S&P 500 is headed back to its March lows.”All 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 down
2.9 per cent to 1,294.18 points, its lowest level in three months. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3 per cent to 2,321.37 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3 per cent to 11,455.86 points and has lost 9.4 per cent so far in June, its worst month since the Great Depression.Homebuilders struggled after Lennar, the second-biggest US homebuilder, reported a fifth successive quarterly loss and one that was larger than expected.Stuart Miller, chief executive, said: “The remainder of 2008 will likely see further deterioration in overall market conditions.’’That news swamped a report by the National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales rose
2 per cent to a 4.99m annual rate in May after falling for the previous two months.Lennar fell 8.4 per cent to $13.34 while DR Horton and Centex slipped 5.7 per cent to $11.80 and 7.7 per cent to $14.21, respectively.In the background, macro-economic data did little to improve the mood. A four-week average of initial jobless claims rose to its highest level since October 2005.Amid the widespread malaise, industrials tumbled 3.9 per cent, led by GE and United Technologies. GE fell 5.2 per cent to $26.53 and a five-year low, while United lost 4.9 per cent to $62.79.Even the best performing sectors lost ground. Consumer staples fell 2.1 per cent after ConAgra Foods predicted fiscal 2009 earnings that undershot some projections. ConAgra fell 5.5 per cent to $20.92.Smith and Wesson, the gunmaker, was a rare exception, rallying 6.7 per cent to $5.45 after the US Supreme Court ruled that a sweeping ban on handguns in Washington DC was unconstitutional.Searching for a note of optimism in the broad-based sell-off, Mr Detrick said: “We haven’t seen a major spike up in volatility.“People are obviously losing confidence but they are not yet ready to throw in the towel.”"
620;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-26T14:12:50Z;Sporting interest;;Gavin Dein has been an HSBC customer since he was 14. He opened his first current account with the group, used its credit cards to finance his student days and has been saving with the group ever since.So, it was not a hard choice when it came to choosing a private bank manager to look after his now more complex financial requirements. And it just so happened that HSBC Private Bank was a perfect fit to Dein’s individual circumstances.The 32-year-old son of David Dein, the former vice-chairman of Arsenal Football Club, has grown up with sport. He has worked at Arsenal, as well as Nike, and seven years ago he launched his own sports business.His private company, Reward, is a cardless loyalty programme for sports fans. Every time members shop at JJB Sports, Halfords, Amazon and many other well-known names using a registered credit or debit card, they automatically receive points. These points can be exchanged for sports goods or discounts on tickets to their favourite sports events. Retailers pay a fee for the use of Reward’s services or a commission for the business it pushes in their direction.“It fits in quite nicely that I’ve been loyal to the same bank for a long time,” says Dein. “I’ve moved through different services the bank offers and now do all my business banking with them as well.”It also fit quite nicely that HSBC Private Bank offered a specialist sports division. The bank launched this service two years ago to deal exclusively with successful sportsmen and women and other industry professionals.“The sports element really set HSBC apart,” says Dein. “It meant the bank had a unique understanding of my life and the global sports industry.”This bank’s specialist knowledge has been a great help to Dein as he has built up his business. His family connections meant he already had a great contact book of sports professionals. But, he says, HSBC Private Bank provided him with a valuable network of contacts across the world, which he has regularly tapped into.Dein has ended up doing business with a number of people introduced to him by the bank and has gained valuable advice and insight into the workings of the global sports market.Assuming Reward grows as anticipated and capitalises on the expected boom in the loyalty management market, its market value could exceed £100m ($195m) in the next couple of years. Dein has a 25 per cent stake in the group.His private banking is overseen by Mark Pannes, who runs the sports division. Pannes worked in the sports business for almost 20 years before joining HSBC Private Bank and, therefore, has a broad knowledge of how the industry works in the UK and abroad.“Gavin keeps us on speed dial for when he wants a contact or someone who can offer a view on something in the industry,” says Pannes.Dein is ahppy to admit that he is a “pretty needy customer”. But he says his business commitments leave him very little free time.“HSBC is able to make sure everything is taken care of,” he says. “From the little everyday things to the much bigger decisions.”Dein says that when he first became a private client, HSBC took a great deal of time to understand his business and the kind of financial help he would need.He says his approach to investing has always been fairly conservative and he does not expect this to change any time soon, especially with the current economic outlook.A significant proportion of his net worth is tied up in his own company. So outside of the business, he does not like to take too much risk.Pannes says he has tried to create an investment strategy for Dein’s personal portfolio that complements his business, where most of his investment risk is concentrated.“I have established an investment programme where risk is broadly spread and the portfolio conservatively placed,” he says.The only shares Dein owns, other than those in his own business, are in Arsenal Football Club.Pannes expects Reward to grow rapidly, because his client has been successful in making business contacts and expanding his company into Europe and beyond.One loyalty programme allows AC Milan fans to collect points when they shop, which can be swapped for official kit, merchandise and tickets. Another, developed in conjunction with MasterCard Europe, rewards shoppers with a range of football merchandise, such as Euro 2008 tickets.
621;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-18T21:43:59Z;Adidas dismisses Olympic protest talk;;Sponsors of the Olympic Games should not be responsible for standing up to the Chinese government over Tibet because otherwise they would have to talk to every government around the world about every conflict, according to the chief executive of Adidas.Herbert Hainer, the head of the world’s second-largest sporting goods company and a sponsor of the Beijing games this summer, said politicians and not companies should take the responsibility for such matters.“If we as a sponsor had to stand up and speak against the government in China then at the next event we have to speak against the government in the US because we could talk about Guantánamo, we can talk about Eta in Spain and so on, and so on. So I definitely don’t think that this is the job of the sports companies and the sponsors of the Olympic Games,” he told the Financial Times.Olympic sponsors have been put under great pressure from some lobby groups to speak out about human rights in Tibet or Darfur in Sudan.Western sponsors – which include Coca-Cola, General Electric and Volkswagen – have been forced to tread a fine line between keeping consumers onside in China, one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and not offending customers in their home countries.Mr Hainer argued that the heaviest criticism of China was coming mainly from a few countries such as France and Germany.He added: “The Chinese market is a very big one for us and it will shortly be the second-biggest market in the world for us, after the US market. But once again, this is not the reason why we didn’t speak up on the Tibet conflict.” Adidas could help the most in more discreet ways such as improving working conditions and pay for its Chinese workers.Mr Hainer also underscored his belief that issues such as Tibet were a political, not a business, affair: “This conflict is, at least to my knowledge, 49 years old and it cannot be solved in a few weeks before the Olympic Games and therefore I definitely do believe that the politicians shouldn’t shift their responsibility away because this is their responsibility and they should take it.”Speaking in Vienna where the 2008 European Championships are taking place, he said Adidas was “already one of the winners” from the competition in spite of arch-rival Nike having more teams in the quarter-finals. Adidas will earn “significantly more” than the €1.2bn ($1.9bn) it forecast.He also said that the election of a new president later this year in the US would help the economy and consumer sentiment in a country where Adidas’s Reebok brand – which it bought for $3.8bn three years ago – is struggling.
622;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-06T05:00:33Z;Hembly boss buys Sergio Tacchini;;"A Hong Kong businessman has bought Sergio Tacchini, the Italian tennis-wear brand that in its prime sponsored top players John McEnroe and Pete Sampras but has since fallen on hard times.The purchase by Billy Ngok, who is also chairman of Hembly, a distributor and supply-chain services company, marks the first Chinese acquisition of a major European sportswear brand.The deal also adds to the growing number of recent foreign brand acquisitions by Chinese manufacturers and so-called “middlemen” companies seeking to move up the value chain.Xinyu Hengdeli, the biggest luxury watch retailer in China, bought a 90 per cent stake in Italian hand-crafted pen brand Omas from LVMH last October.Sergio Tacchini, an Italian tennis player, founded the eponymous brand in 1966. It claims to have introduced colour into professional tennis apparel that had previously been white-only. The brand enjoyed success in Italy and France, enlisting top-seeded tennis stars including Jimmy Connors, Martina Hingis, and more recently Goran Ivanisevic when he won the Wimbledon title as a wild-card in 2001.But intense competition from global sportswear brands such as Nike and Adidas, a lack of expansion beyond its core European market and an overall decline in the tennis wear market has resulted in heavy losses in the past few years for the family-owned business.There were other problems, such as an acrimonious break-up with Ms Hingis in 1999 that led to her suing the brand in 2002 for giving her shoes that she claimed had hurt her feet.Sergio Tacchini filed for bankruptcy in Italy early last year, which created an opportunity for Mr Ngok to buy the brand, as Hembly was already a supplier for Sergio Tacchini.Mr Ngok closed the deal in late April to buy Sergio Tacchini’s assets for €27m ($42m) and inject an extra €33m into the business, and revealed the details to the Financial Times yesterday. Mr Ngok, who made the acquisition as a private investment, has granted Hembly an option to purchase Sergio Tacchini within the next three years.“Instead of producing just for the manufacturer’s [profit] margin, we are moving into the brand management margin,” Mr Ngok said. “Why, today, am I only working for other people?”Under a lease agreement, a team assembled by Mr Ngok has already been managing Sergio Tacchini for the past year. During that time, the company had sales of €60m and a modest profit.Mr Ngok plans to introduce the Sergio Tacchini brand into mainland China next year and open 200 stores there in the following three years. By 2012, China should account for up to
30 per cent of the brand’s global sales, Mr Ngok said. “China will be the engine of growth [for Sergio Tacchini]”, he added."
623;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-06-02T00:36:38Z;Paces: Getting girls out and about;;Palestinian girls living in Hebron, a city in the occupied West Bank that has a reputation for conservatism, normally have few places to socialise outside their homes.One exception is Hebron’s first and only girls’ basketball club, where a team of young players is coached several times a week for free. The girls go about their practice sessions clad in traditional headscarves – and boasting brand new kits of sports gear provided by Nike, the US group.The team was founded with the help – and even the insistence – of Paces, a charity dedicated to improving the lives of Palestinian children through sport.Founded two years ago by the Kuwait-born, London-based Palestinian Hani Qattan, the organisation has grown rapidly. “We launched our first projects in November 2006. We started with five clubs and about 400 children,” says Maria Ardaji, Paces’ country director for Palestine. In the school year that is about to come to an end, Paces supported 1,500 children in 31 sports clubs, including four clubs in the embattled Gaza Strip. From August onward, Paces will support 3,000 children, and Ms Ardaji expects that number to double again in 2009.“The idea is to get as many kids as we can off the streets and away from violence and extremism and give them something constructive and positive to do. We want to give them better opportunities for the future,” explains Ms Ardaji.Paces works according to a simple plan: the charity offers to pay and train Palestinian basketball and football coaches, while its partnership with Nike ensures that all children participating in the scheme get kitted out with shirts, shorts, shoes (and two pairs of Nike socks each). The clubs have to ensure that the children have practice at least twice a week for two hours, though in reality most provide more training than the minimum required.The money provided by Paces – about $33,000 a month this year and double that next year – is evenly divided between supporting boys and girls. An important condition for financing is that the sports clubs are not affiliated with any political group such as Fatah or Hamas. Paces also refuses to co-operate either with the Palestinian Authority or any Israeli institution.Poverty and continuing instability in the territories mean children there have few of the opportunities that are normal in most western countries. Tradition and social conservatism make it especially hard for many girls to go out and enjoy themselves.Mr Qattan describes the group’s mission like this: “We get the boys off the streets and the girls out of their houses.”And while they are out there, Paces also tries to teach the children skills and values that transcend sport. In partnership with another charity, it holds sessions at the sports clubs that deal with children’s rights and gender equality, health and hygiene and – for older teenagers – even on how to start a business and deal with money. “So many kids here are deprived of their childhood. This is about getting kids to do something constructive,” says Ms Ardaji.
624;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-05-12T03:55:42Z;A city under the surgeon’s knife;;Reinvention is a dangerous business. For many people the solution comes in an overpriced bottle or at the end of a sharp surgical instrument. Companies find it through a new corporate identity or new organic- shaped furniture in the canteen. But what do you do if you’re a country that needs a total overhaul?In less critical cases you call in the branding experts, they give you a snappy presentation and you pay dearly for a new slogan. Portugal recently attempted to fashion itself as “Europe’s West Coast”. I’m not sure what the Irish and Norwegians made of this claim, but it left me wondering whether Portugal was selling itself as the potential home of a Euro-Google/Nike/Microsoft or a land that might soon be filled with malls and washed-up celebrities. The ad campaign never delivered much of an answer.Cosmetic makeovers on sovereign states tend to have the same effect as a bit too much plastic surgery on people – they all start to look the same. Been down Madison Avenue between 65th and 85th recently? There’s an entire sub-species of pained, stretched-looking women and men who all look vaguely related due to their bubble lips and wide, manga-style eyes. A lot of countries that adopt a new slogan and logo feel equally samey. Is Croatia Europe’s west coast in the east? And why is everyone smiling about Bahrain?In more extreme cases a nation might find itself surrounded by a team of powerful consultants bent on advancing their own interests and not too concerned about what actually happens to the patient on the table. Lebanon comes to mind.I have just returned from Beirut after a five-day refresher tour. In many ways it was much as I’d left it 11 years ago – chaotic, a little edgy but oddly relaxed. The last time I was in Beirut I was on something of a mercy mission. Having spent time covering the country from 1991, I made a trip in spring 1997 with photographer Matthew Hranek to document buildings that were on the brink of vanishing.At the time, the hot topic was architectural preservation. Developers wanted to bulldoze anything that was pock-marked and throw up glittering offices, apartments and hotels. Their opponents wanted to restore Beirut to a city of parks, greenery and more classical architecture. Oddly, little attention was paid to the architecture that had come to define the city – its collection of modernist apartment blocks, Verner Panton-inspired shop interiors and cliff-hugging villas. For a week we crawled through the city in our driver Abed’s faded Mercedes and documented as much as we could: crumbling Ottoman villas, 1930s French deco apartments, 1960s travel agencies filled with Knoll furniture and cafés from the early 1970s.Beirut has been in and out of the operating theatre more than any city in modern history. Indeed, many of its residents have started to look like that peculiar tribe on the Upper East side – all shelf-like boobs and bums. Sadly, much of the good has been stripped away in the process. On arrival, the first thing I wanted to do was take a coffee at Modca in Hamra – only to find that the modernist gem had been replaced by a Danish fashion store that clearly got off lightly following the Mohammed cartoon protests.Around the corner, the Beirut Express travel agency was shuttered but at least its jet-age logo peeked out along the top. Down the hill at the Mies-like Gefinor Centre, the campy Sudan Airways ticket bureau was gone but thankfully the rest of the centre was much as I remembered it – save for the ugly branch of Sbarro pizza that, I believe, replaced Aeroflot.Beirutis wonder whether visitors will return this summer and help steer the economy in the right direction or if the current lack of leadership is paving the way for a factional free-for-all. Many seem to think it’ll be more of the latter, and the violent events of the past few days seem to be proving them right.With their road blocks and gun battles, Hezbollah has done an excellent job of turning business away from the newly renovated downtown with their ragged, dusty camp in the middle of what should be the most buzzy city centre in the Middle East.For reasons right and wrong, “brand Beirut” remains one of the most powerful in the world. Conjuring up images of destruction, glamour, human suffering and of an alluring capital adrift at far end of the Mediterranean, it manages to hold as much tourism appeal as any of the Gulf upstarts. Where other cities and countries have to manufacture the excitement and pre-package the history, Beirut has it all from the moment you emerge from the airport.The biggest plus is that you can indulge in all those things that are now banned elsewhere in the world – drive as fast as you like, ride a motorbike without a helmet, drink as late as you want, run traffic lights and dance in dingy 1970s bars that would be condemned in other cities.Lebanon is not in need of a tourism campaign just yet as it needs to get many other rooms in its house in order first (a president perhaps?) but one day a “Liberal Lebanon” initiative could be just the slogan to bring back millions of tourists who are tired of being nannied in their home markets.Tyler Brûlé is editor-in-chief of Monoclewww.monocle.comtyler.brule@ft.com
625;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-05-05T19:16:38Z;Out of the door: Tax treatment tempts businesses to move country;;When Halliburton moved its headquarters from Houston to Dubai last year, the oil services group provoked a political storm. Despite assurances that the company was not seeking to avoid tax or scrutiny, the move was lambasted by Democrats as an example of corporate greed. Senator Hillary Clinton led the attack, denouncing the move as “disgraceful”.On the other side of the Atlantic, the spotlight is also on corporate defections after two big UK companies said last month they were shifting to Ireland for tax reasons. Others have also hinted at leaving. When United Business Media, a trade publisher, announced the move of its headquarters to Ireland, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury affairs spokesman, criticised this as “blatant tax avoidance”.Politicians fear loss of jobs and tax revenues when companies move their headquarters. But their moral indignation cuts little ice with multinationals whose ties with their home countries have diminished because of international expansion and cross-border mergers.Over the last decade, 6 per cent of multinationals have relocated, partly for tax reasons, according to research from Oxford University’s Centre for Business Taxation. Companies competing with rivals based in lower-tax regimes are under pressure to cut their tax bills. Moreover, they are being wooed as never before by small countries keen to attract skilled jobs or create a larger tax base.UBS, the investment bank, predicts a “gradual erosion of governments’ ability to tax”. When Shire, the UK pharmaceutical company, announced its move to low-tax Ireland last month, Amit Kara, director of UBS, said: “This is the kind of tax competition we should expect. The pressure will remain on countries such as the UK to continue lowering corporation tax especially for the fleet-footed. The tax burden may shift to smaller companies.”At first sight, there is little reason for governments to panic about the threat of shifting headquarters. Companies will still pay tax on the factories, sales and other profitable activities in the countries where they operate. But finance ministries fear that migrating companies will find new ways to strip the tax base of the countries where they operate. Academic research published last year showed that foreign-owned manufacturers in Europe paid less than half as much tax as domestically owned businesses.Julian Alworth, an associate fellow at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, sees fiscal reasons as dominant in determining relocations. He told a recent conference: “When you look at why companies are moving headquarters, it is often to reduce the liability in the country where their headquarters are located and where they have their operations.” He cited a controversial attempt by Stanley Works, the US tool manufacturer, to move its headquarters to Bermuda in 2002, which was ditched after a political outcry.The suspicions of finance ministries are also aroused by the mobility of the income that companies derive from intellectual property or financing operations. Many big countries attempt to trap this income in their tax net using anti-avoidance rules. By moving to a more lenient regime, companies hope to escape these restrictions.Boasting an attractive tax regime for intellectual property has become part of the marketing pitch for countries wanting to attract foreign corporations, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals. Kraft, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have all recently switched their European headquarters from the UK to Switzerland. Ebay, Amazon and Microsoft have moved to Luxembourg. The Netherlands boasts names such as Cisco Systems, Nike and Starbucks.As multinationals become more skillful at managing their intellectual property, there are tax as well as commercial advantages. By holding brands and patents in low-tax countries and charging other subsidiaries for their use, profits are lowered in high-tax countries.Unsurprisingly, these shifts of intellectual capital are unpopular with many tax authorities. Two years ago, Mark Everson, former commissioner of the US Internal Revenue Service, warned that the increasing transfer of intangibles was a “high-risk compliance concern”, adding: “Taxpayers, especially in the high technology and pharmaceutical industries, are shifting profits offshore.”The small, low-tax countries that encourage profit-shifting of this sort are also criticised. Ireland’s success at attracting knowledge-based companies is seen as overly aggressive by some rival governments. Arnauld Montebourg, a French politician, last year accused low-tax Switzerland of “predatory practices”. The Netherlands – which attracted Ikea from Sweden and Gucci from Italy – was lambasted for its approach to taxing mobile income by the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, a non-profit research group. “All the empirical evidence indicates that the Netherlands is a tax haven,” it said.These criticisms are shrugged off by tax competition advocates, who believe tax competitiveness encourages investment. But resentment from larger rivals poses risks for small countries eager for foreign business. One of the worst fears of Ireland’s politicians is that the republic will be arm-twisted into adopting the European Commission’s proposals for a common method of computing corporate taxes. When Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, said last month that France would push this concept forward in its European Union presidency, Bertie Ahern, the outgoing Irish prime minister, dismissed it as a “daft” idea.Big countries are meanwhile strengthening their defences. In the US, the IRS is fighting the migration of intellectual property, inflicting tax demands running into billions of dollars on pharmaceutical companies. Germany has just reinforced its rules on the transfer of assets to foreign companies. The UK has proposed tightening its anti-avoidance rules by taxing the worldwide “passive” income of companies with UK headquarters.But the problem is that these tougher regimes impose a hefty compliance burden on companies and expose them to the risk of double taxation. In the UK, the complexities of the proposed anti-avoidance system have exasperated big businesses already disenchanted with Britain’s tax regime. Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, the British employers’ federation, says companies “are seriously concerned about the high level and rising complexity of taxation in the UK and are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet”.Shire said it was leaving to “help protect the group’s tax position”. UBM said its long-term interests would be helped by Ireland’s “less complex system of taxation”. But nobody can confidently predict whether this trickle will become a flood. There are some powerful factors that deter companies from migrating, including the prospect of capital gains tax bills and the threat of reputational damage.Also, for all the criticism of Britain’s tax regime, it has an enduring appeal for some multinationals because of its generous treatment of interest costs and payments to shareholders. Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, thought hard about moving its tax domicile when it tried to acquire ABN Amro last year but calculated that its shareholders would be better off if it stayed in Britain.Nonetheless, more big companies are considering leaving the UK. International Power, WPP, AstraZeneca and GSK have all hinted that the matter is under review. A few years ago, this could have been viewed as sabre-rattling. But a big barrier to migration has recently been lifted: companies are no longer required to have a UK base to be included in the FTSE index.Nor can the government rely on exit taxes to stem the tide. Unlike the US, which has tried to devise laws to keep companies on American soil, European governments are under pressure to remove barriers to movement within the single market.In Britain, the threat of an exodus has sparked a debate about how policymakers should respond. Insurers are lobbying the Treasury for concessions to stem migrations to Bermuda. Deloitte, the professional services company, has argued for a special tax rate on mobile income such as trademarks. Another radical option being discussed is imposing a minimum tax for multinationals on their UK profits, as an alternative to stringent anti-avoidance measures.The Treasury has an awkward dilemma. It depends on corporate taxpayers for a tenth of its revenue. It does not want to make overly generous concessions. Nor does it wish to single out specific sectors or types of income for concessions, which might create new loopholes for avoidance.So far, the Treasury’s focus has been on making the tax regime more attractive for multinationals by exempting foreign profits from tax. This move could help stop corporate migrations, were it not accompanied by tougher anti-avoidance rules. One of the main reasons why DaimlerChrysler based itself in Germany rather than the US after its 1998 merger (subsequently unwound) was that Germany exempted foreign profits from tax.The UK has also promised to cut the corporation tax further, following a 2 percentage point fall to 28 per cent this year. Gordon Brown last week told business leaders that one of his aims as prime minister was “to reduce corporation tax even further when we can afford to do so”. Some businesses are clamouring for radical cuts. A recent CBI taskforce called for the corporation tax rate to fall, over time, to 18 per cent.A view sometimes aired in government is that large countries such as the UK should be more sanguine about losing the headquarters of big domestic businesses and focus on attracting “real business” into the country, regardless of who owns or controls it. Genuine investment goes to countries where it can be deployed. Tax is far less important in these considerations than proximity to markets, infrastructure and the availability of skilled staff.Yet if countries such as Britain become reconciled to losing headquarters to lower-tax rivals, they will pay a price. As well as shedding well-paid jobs and advisory work, they risk a decline in influence and investment as decision-makers go elsewhere. When world-leading businesses uproot themselves, more is at stake than national pride.
626;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-05-01T02:45:58Z;Profile: Education is the way forward;;Last year, worldwide infant mortality dipped below 10m – to 9.7m – for the first time in history. The fall to single digits was due in large measure to the United Nations Children’s Fund’s immunisation programme.Established at the end of the second world war, Unicef was created to provide food, clothing and health care to European children facing famine.It became a permanent part of the UN in 1953, when it started a global campaign against yaws, a disfiguring disease affecting millions of children and one curable with penicillin.The fund operates in 164 countries, where it is cranking up emergency supplies to cope with global food shortages, most of them in conflict zones. Its $2.2bn annual budget is raised by national committees, voluntary government donations and, increasingly, private-sector partnerships.In 1961, after more than a decade of focus on health issues – in which it often secured ceasefires in civil conflicts and immunised the children of both sides – the fund expanded into addressing the needs of the whole child, beginning its abiding concern with education.“More children – and many more girls – than ever before are receiving an education,” says Geoffrey Keele, Unicef’s chief spokesman in New York.“One of the biggest lessons we have learned in emergency situations, whether it be conflict or natural disaster, is the importance of schooling.”Classes “restore order and structure” to a child’s life, he says, and can be conducted anywhere, such as under a tree or in a tent.Unicef supplies teachers with blackboards and children with notebooks, pencils, erasers, crayons and rulers. “A learning environment provides a feeling of normalcy,” says Mr Keele. “It’s an environment in which we can identify children who are isolated and withdrawn and might need more support.”It serves other purposes too. “It can be a great launch pad for tracing family members and treating malnourishment.”Unicef’s activities have led to greater acceptance of the rights of the child, as governments recognise the importance to their country’s economic well-being of nurturing the next generation.But, remaining problem areas include HIV-Aids in sub-Saharan and west Africa. Of the 62 countries making little or no progress towards the Millennium Development Goals on child survival, nearly 75 per cent are in Africa.The other big issue is the sexual exploitation of children, mostly in eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. Mr Keele says the ability to traffic children has become much easier with the growth of the internet.Another area of exploitation is child labour in developing countries, often by multinationals and particularly in the sports goods and textiles industries.“We have been in close discussions with corporations such as Nike looking at the best way of eradicating child labour,” says John Winston, head of international and corporate alliances for Unicef.“Entire industries rely on child labour …But we don’t just close the door on companies. We realise the complexities, and are always looking at ways to engage with them.”Mr Winston says the fund started building relationships with the corporate sector in the 1990s, long before social responsibility became a big influence on companies’ behaviour.A campaign with British Airways in which passengers donated spare change has been one of the most successful, he says. “It was as a result of the partnership with the airline that, when the tsunami happened in 2004, it chartered 747s for our operations in Indonesia.”Unicef’s relationship with Barcelona football club is also effective. Barcelona, whose players wear the Unicef logo on their shirts, have pledged €1.5m ($2.3m) a year over five years and show a keen interest in sports programmes in the field.“Sport can be a fantastic way of teaching the values of life. It can also be a re­uniting activity in areas of conflict,” says Mr Winston.Working for an organisation such as Unicef requires passion and commitment, says Dash Joshi, its head of recruitment.“Some are in it for the adrenaline of being in an emergency situation or heading a programme as a country representative.”The highest turnover of staff is in emergency situations, where burn-out can be high. “No one does more than two years in an emergency situation,” he says.
627;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-04-24T18:26:26Z;Breakfast and bottoms;;In the breakfast cereal aisle of a Manhattan supermarket, a box of General Mills’Cheerios is advertising a special offer. A small green panel offers the chance to save $1.50 on a box of Pampers disposable nappies, made by Procter & Gamble.Over in the babycare aisle, packs of Pampers return the favour – with an image of a small round Cheerio linked with the brand’s heart logo, and a coupon to save $1.50 on any packet of the cereal.The on-pack coupon promotions are part of the “together for bright mornings” marketing campaign the two brands launched at the start of the year, highlighting a relationship bet­ween breakfast cereal and babies’ bottoms that might not otherwise have been apparent.Pampers, says the panel on the cereal packet, can help babies sleep better by helping to stop “leaks”, while Cheerios, the wheat cereal, has been recommended by one in five US paediatricians as a first “finger food” for toddlers.The campaign is the latest example of the consumer product industry’s pursuit of what it calls “customer focused” innovation, bringing together two companies that might not otherwise have realised their complementary relationship. Just as Nike and Apple looked at joggers listening to music and teamed up in 2005 to create the Nike+ running system, which combines running shoes and iPods, so Cheerios looked at its customers and saw the wisdom of a tie-up with Pampers.The initiative, says Becky O’Grady, marketing director for Cheerios, was about “being very consumer focused, really trying to be led by insights into their needs, and putting that into the marketing”.Behind the alliance lay an effort by Cheerios to look more closely at its consumers. It started segmenting them at the end of last year into four distinct groups: health-conscious adults, families, children and young parents, the target of the joint promotion with Pampers.“The foundation of the brand is the first finger-food moment – which means moms [with children] in the one to two age group – and if you talk to consumers …where they first and most emotionally connected with the brand, that life stage is at the centre,” says Ms O’Grady.Cheerios’ marketing campaign includes a parents’ section of the brand website that lists tips and articles on parenting, as well as a gallery of users’ photos, with their own brief anecdotes or tips.The children’s section, in contrast, provides cartoons and computer games.In the supermarkets, Cheerios has also started appearing alongside baby food. General Mills has created a new refillable plastic “toddler pack”, holding just over an ounce of cereal. The new packages appeared shortly after Nestlé’s baby food company Gerber launched its Fruit Puffs, cereal-style finger food. The re­usable containers, says Ms O’Grady, were created after observing parents putting Cheerios in plastic bags as a portable snack for their infants.The tie-up with Pampers came through their mutual advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi Americas. Saatchi, says Ms O’Grady, “was at the core of bringing the two groups together and saying, here’s a non-competitive area where you can get together and really understand the moms and what they want,” she says.The idea occurred, according to Mary Baglivo, chief executive of the advertising division, when two groups working on the separate accounts happened to start talking to each other. “They arrived at the thought that we could do some co-marketing together …that it would be fantastic for the business, and drive sales while contributing to each others’ brand equity.”Saatchi, whose advertising philosophy currently focuses on building emotional relationships with customers, argues that the tie-up “pushed forward” the emotional equity in the brands, which in Ms Baglivo’s view, “have a connection not just from the fact that they target the same group …but a connection in emotion and tonality”.For Cheerios, however, parents are only one of its target customer groups, and the link with Pampers has to work alongside its other targeted marketing.Ms O’Grady says the brand, which was first launched in 1946, needs to perform “a balancing act, and to talk about how to address to those consumers in the right way, and not to do anything that would alienate any particular group at any particular time”.“I think we’ve balanced that in a way that is true to the brand,” she says of the Pampers link-up.Ms Baglivo argues that emotion is the key, which is why it is acceptable to read about Pampers on the back of a breakfast cereal packet.“I think most people, when they see anything to do with a baby, tend to go to the cute and sweet side and not the down and dirty side …we have never had any polarising comments,” she says.
628;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-04-17T02:26:42Z;JJB makes drastic cuts after setback;;The chairman of JJB Sports described some of his company’s shops as “like a third world country” on Wednesday, as the sportswear chain announced plans to close 72 of its 409 stores and cut 800 jobs.The blunt assessment and drastic store reduction plan, which will cost up to £23m, came as the company reported a 29 per cent fall in profit before exceptionals to £33.8m in the year to January 27, on marginally higher sales of £812m.Roger Lane-Smith’s comments were aimed at the company’s unrefurbished stores but he said a new store format was proving popular with customers and sports brands.Mr Lane-Smith said Chris Ronnie, the chief executive who joined the group last June, was the right person to take charge of a recovery.Mr Ronnie, who led a consortium that bought a 29 per cent stake in JJB from Dave Whelan, its founder, described the unrefurbished stores as like “George of the Jungle”, cluttered with merchandise squeezed into small spaces and difficult for shoppers to navigate.Mr Ronnie has been behind an aggressive clearance sale, including discounts of up to 90 per cent, as he attempts to clear a backlog of old stock.He criticised a decision by Umbro to bring out a new England football shirt, an important piece of merchandise for JJB, at a time of low demand.He said sales had been disappointing and the sportswear manufacturer would be better run now it had been acquired by Nike.Mr Ronnie is aiming to capture more of the upmarket sportswear sales that have been the hallmark of JD Sports, its rival, which reported like-for-like sales growth of 4.2 per cent in the 10 weeks to April 12.By contrast, like-for-like sales at JJB fell 3 per cent in the seven weeks to March 16.Earnings per share for the year fell 63 per cent to 4.07p. Adjusted earnings fell 23 per cent to 10.89p. The final dividend is maintained at 7p for a 10p total.The shares closed up 3½p at 117¼p.FT Comment● The only recent winner at JJB Sports has been Dave Whelan, the former professional footballer and financial backer of Wigan Athletic, who founded the chain and sold his stake at 275p a share last summer. Since then it has been downhill for investors and a tough challenge for Chris Ronnie, who bought Mr Whelan’s 29 per cent last June with Exista, an Icelandic financial service group. Unhelpful weather and the England football team’s failure to qualify for the Euro 2008 tournament have depressed sales. In the longer term, Mr Ronnie may be the person to drive a recovery but a forward price/earnings multiple of more than 11, coupled with a thinly covered dividend, means that probability of success is priced too high.
629;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-04-03T01:21:40Z;Italy’s Geox introduces running shoes;;Geox on Wednesday unwrapped its first pair of running shoes as the rapidly growing Italian company seeks to take on the giants of global sportswear.Geox, which is based in north-east Italy, was founded only in 1995 and has enjoyed explosive growth so far only in the “brown shoe” market – mid-priced work and casual shoes. Its 2007 revenues rose 26 per cent on the year before at €770m ($1.2bn).On Wednesday Geox showed off its first running shoes, which will seek a hold in a very consolidated market dominated by Nike and Adidas, companies with revenues over 10 times that of Geox. People close to the Italian company said it hoped to launch a range of golf shoes in the next year.The company’s image is dominated by Mario Moretti Polegato, Geox’s founder and chairman, who has become one of the most vaunted entrepreneurs in Italy.It was Mr Polegato’s idea to develop shoes that “breathe” – soles that supposedly allow sweat out of a patented membrane while stopping water and dirt from coming in – upon which the whole concept of Geox is founded. He has taken to making “breathable” clothing too.The company said on Wednesday its running shoes had a new system installed – after four years of research – to cope with the extra sweat and heat created by exercise. The system helped combat a lack of hygiene and ailments such as athlete’s foot, the company said.Geox suffered a serious setback in February, when it announced 2007 results below analysts’ high expectations.The shares have fallen 33 per cent in the last six months and the company has a market capitalisation of about €2.5bn.Geox made €123m in net income last year, which represents a 16 per cent increase on the previous year’s figure, but has lowered some of its margin forecasts partly because of the rising costs of store openings.
630;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-03-21T16:20:48Z;Interventions spur rally in US financials;;After several immensely volatile sessions, Wall Street stocks closed the abbreviated week higher, thanks to a rally in financials based on unprecedented interventions and rate cuts by the US authorities.The benchmark S&P 500 index made early gains on Thursday and continued in that vein, closing at 1,329.51 points, up 2.4 per cent for the day and 3.2 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.1 per cent over the week to close at 2,258.11 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 3.4 per cent to 12,361.32.Markets were shut on Friday for the Easter holiday.Amid the turbulence there were some clear winners.Joseph Vietri, vice president of active trading at Charles Schwab, said: “Volatility is a trader’s best friend because with extreme moves one way or the other there are incredible opportunities to make money.”Financial stocks made up ground, carried by growing confidence in the Federal Reserve’s drastic measures to ease liquidity constraints through interest rate cuts and other extraordinary interventions in the week.The surge in financials’ stock prices takes them close to their levels before the rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns last week.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said: “The Fed’s recent policy actions, in particular the decision to open the discount window to non-bank primary dealers, appear to be alleviating some financial market strains.“This is certainly positive news for the economy. However, even if the markets stabilise in the relatively near term – a big ‘if’ to be sure – the economic fallout will continue to weigh on the medium-term growth outlook.”An index of investment banks surged 13 per cent over the week while the broader S&P financials index rose 11.9 per cent.Merrill Lynch shrugged off concerns that it could be forced to take further writedowns after suing to prevent a counterparty from backing out of credit guarantee contracts. The shares added 7.7 per cent to close at $46.85.Better than expected results from Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley helped soothe investors and the pair climbed 23.9 per cent to $48.65 and 25.6 per cent to $25.6 per cent to $49.67 over the week.The exception was CIT Group, which leases aircraft and trains and provides financing to companies. Its shares plummeted after a series of ratings downgrades forced the company to tap emergency credit lines. The stock, which has lost more than 80 per cent of its value in the past six months, tumbled 36.8 per cent over the week to close at $9.63.Commentators warned that although financial markets seemed to be stabilising, investors were likely to remain skittish, and indices volatile, for some time.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “I think this week we have made a stand. The only caveat I have is that given their highly leveraged nature, more hedge funds are bound to collapse, so we could get bouts of selling that can’t be avoided.”Markets were also lifted by positive earnings news from Nike and Barnes & Noble and the latest numbers from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, which showed that while factory activity in the industrial heartlands of the US continued to shrink, it did so a at slower pace than expected.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “The key message from this survey is that things are quite bad, but that sentiment has, so far, weakened further than hard activity. Manufacturing growth is slow but the sector is not in meltdown.”Nike rose 12.2 per cent to $67.27 on strong earnings while Barnes & Noble’s forecast-beating results, and indications that it could buy rival Borders, drove its share price up 7.5 per cent to $30.27 over the week.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac soared after regulators said they would allow the government-chartered mortgage companies to reduce their capital requirements, freeing them up to inject up to $200bn into the troubled housing market.The pair were the biggest gainers in the S&P index over the week, rising by more than 53 per cent each after regulators reduced their surplus capital requirements, to close at $34.30 and $32.58 respectively.Frederick Cannon, a KBW analyst, said: “Recent government actions have increased our expectations for Fannie Mae [and Freddie Mac] to be an active participant in stabilising the mortgage markets.” Mr Cannon upgraded the lenders to “outperform” and raised his price targets on the stocks to $48 and $46 respectively.

However, even if the markets stabilize in the relatively near term—a big ‘if’ to be sure—the economic fallout will continue to weigh on the medium-term growth outlook.”An index of investment banks surged 11.2 per cent while the broader S&P financials index rose 6.9 per cent.Citigroup, the biggest U.S. bank, led the gainers on the Dow, surging 10.2 per cent to $22.50. Earlier in the day it said it would cut 2,000 more trading and investment-banking jobs in an effort to respond to subprime-related losses.Merrill Lynch shares rose 13 per cent to $46.85 on rumors the brokerage could sell off assets in order to shore up its balance sheet.Merrill shares were heavily sold on Wednesday over concerns that it could be forced to take further writedowns after suing to prevent a counterparty from backing out of credit guarantee contracts.Lehman Brothers, which was the subject of rumor fuelled panic-selling after the near collapse of Bear Stearns earlier in the week, rose 15.2 per cent to $48.65 while shares in Morgan Stanley climbed 14.3 per cent to $49.67.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both rose for a third day, adding 11.7 per cent to $34.30 and 9 per cent to $32.58, respectively after analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods upgraded the companies to “outperform”.Frederick Cannon, a KBW analyst, said: “Recent government actions have increased our expectations for Fannie Mae [and Freddie Mac] to be an active participant in stabilizing the mortgage markets.”KBW also increased its price target for the two government-chartered mortgage companies to $48 and to $46 respectively.The pair were the biggest gainers over the foreshortened week, rising by more than 53 per cent each after regulators reduced their surplus capital requirements, freeing them to pump as much as $200bn of liquidity into the beleaguered US mortgage market.Still, shares in the two companies have fallen by more than 45 per cent over the last six months.Bucking the trend was CIT Group, the largest independent commercial finance company in the U.S, whose shares plummeted after it said it had tapped its $7.3bn emergency credit lines to repay debt and finance its commercial lending.CIT shares, which have lost more than 80 per cent of their value in the last six months, tumbled 17.3 per cent to $9.63.Earnings news combined with the rally in financial stocks to push markets into positive territory, offsetting weakness in the energy and mining sectors hit by a second day of falling commodity prices.Estimate-topping results from Nike after trading closed on Wednesday helped lift sentiment in midday trading, providing further evidence that a still strong global growth may help US multinationals weather a weakening economy at home.Nike shares added 8.8 per cent to $67.27.In other earnings news, Borders, the bookseller, released dramatic results, suspending its quarterly dividend and saying it could put itself up for sale pending a strategic review, despite returning to profit.Borders shares were up as much as 68 per cent in pre-market trade, but dropped 28.6 per cent to $5.07 by the close.Meanwhile, rival Barnes & Noble said fourth-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated, adding that it may consider buying Borders.The company’s shares rose 8.1 per cent to $30.27 in New York trading.Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus recently downgraded both Borders and rival Barnes and Noble, from “buy” to “hold” citing concerns about falling foot traffic and competition from Amazon, the online bookseller.Markets had received a boost earlier in the day with the release of the latest Philly Fed index numbers on manufacturing, which suggested factory activity in the industrial heartland of America shrank for a fourth consecutive month in March, but by less than expected.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “The key message from this survey is that things are quite bad, but that sentiment has, so far, weakened further than hard activity. Manufacturing growth is slow but the sector is not in meltdown.”Less positive also were the latest round of data released on Thursday in which initial jobless claims rose from 356,000 to 378,000, well above consensus expectations of 360,000.Gold miners, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining dropped 7.2 per cent to $42 and 5.6 per cent to $45.97.
632;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
633;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;China Inc looks beyond low costs;;"In Dongguan, a south China manufacturing town where the average shoe industry wage is Rmb960 (£67, €88, $135) a month, one of Nike’s largest contract factories now pays its workers Rmb1,472.Such a differential should spell trouble in an industry where many are struggling with rising costs. But Yue Yuen Industrial is thriving – a fact that could hold lessons for manufacturers far beyond Dongguan and the Pearl River Delta region in southern Guangdong province.The prices of China’s exports have been rising for almost five years. “[China trading] partner country data uniformly show imported footwear, toys, furniture and textile prices falling by around 3 per cent in US dollar terms until 2003, and then rising at 3 per cent to 4 per cent per year thereafter,” Jonathan Anderson, economist at UBS, noted in a recent research report.The recent year-on-year price rises have been remarkably modest considering that labour is just one of many escalating costs that Yue Yuen and others have been contending with. That the company, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Taiwan’s Pou Chen Group, has been able to absorb them provides some clues as to how China’s export juggernaut manages to keep on rolling.Trade and inflation data released this week demonstrate just how difficult an environment China-based exporters now operate in. The Chinese government reported yesterday that the consumer price index clocked a year-on-year rise of 8.7 per cent in February – a 12-year high exacerbated by shortages stemming from January’s severe snowstorms. Adding to exporters’ woes, the renminbi has appreciated 15 per cent against the dollar since mid-2005 and is now poised to break through the Rmb7:$1 barrier.China’s underlying inflationary pressures matter because they could potentially make it much more difficult for exporters to continue to absorb the brunt of domestic cost pressures. Although much distorted by seasonal factors such as this year’s severe winter weather, the country’s January-February trade surplus provided a hint of what could lie ahead, falling 29 per cent year-on-year to $28bn.“We expect [China’s] export figures to rebound in March but continue to anticipate a more moderate slowdown in export growth over the course of the year …A slowdown in China’s export sector constitutes one of the key risks to economic growth,” Jing Ulrich, JPMorgan’s China equities chairman, said in a research note, citing reduced demand in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies that consume two-thirds of the country’s exports.At its factory in Dongguan, however (see picture), Yue Yuen provides ample evidence of the Chinese export sector’s resilience. Last year Guangdong’s footwear exports increased 14.6 per cent to $9.6bn, while textile shipments surged 18.4 per cent to $42bn.Yue Yuen and other large exporters benefit first from the sheer scale of their operations. The 27,000 workers at Yue Yuen’s Nike operations in Dongguan, for example, make 14m pairs of shoes a year – and they are just a small part of a larger manufacturing complex that employs 100,000 people in total.Yue Yuen’s relatively dear labour costs, which are more than 50 per cent higher than the industry average, also mask productivity incentives. At most shoe factories in Dongguan, the average monthly wage is largely determined by working hours and overtime, often in excess of statutory limits. But at Yue Yuen, only about two-thirds of the average salary is attributable to hours worked. “If you have overtime problems you will also have quality and delivery issues,” says Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility.The remaining third of Yue Yuen’s average salary is derived from productivity and quality targets achieved by team-based assembly lines modelled on the “lean” manufacturing principles pioneered by Toyota. “[Workers] can’t hand off a bad piece [to another team member] and kiss it goodbye,” says Sonya Durkin-Jones, Nike’s compliance director for North Asia. Each of Nike’s lean manufacturing lines is branded with the acronym “NOS” – for the Latin novus ordo seclorum, or “a new order for the ages”. The phrase is also emblazoned on the back of US dollar bills, which perhaps explains how it came to be ingrained in Nike’s institutional memory.Last week senior Nike executives spent three days taking journalists around Yue Yuen’s Dongguan plant, citing it as an example of what they hope to achieve across their entire China supply chain, which encompasses about 180 factories and 210,000 workers. One out of every three Nike shoes is made in China.Yue Yuen’s wage premium pays for itself in terms of increased productivity and quality; another benefit is that the company faces fewer of the recruitment headaches afflicting cheaper rivals in an environment where the balance between demand and supply has swung in labour’s favour recently. “We have been constantly challenged by the environment – by all the overtime offered by some of our competitors,” says Johnson Tong, a manager at Pou Chen. “But workers want to make money, not [rack up] hours.”“In this environment you want to reduce your turnover,” adds Ms Jones. “Time to market is much more of a driver for us. How do you achieve that if you are jumping from one factory to another? It’s not about chasing labour costs. It’s about stability and innovation.”A similar attitude prevails across the Pearl River Delta at Esquel, a privately owned Hong Kong shirt-maker that employs 26,000 workers in production facilities in Foshan. Chaired by Marjorie Yang, daughter the founder, Esquel has a client roster that includes the likes of Gap, JC Penney and Nike. Last year it produced 65m shirts.Like Yue Yuen, Esquel must contend with a range of rising costs. The company has also consciously added to them, investing $50m in clean manufacturing facilities including its own power and water treatment plants. The latter handle everything from sewage to industrial dyes.These investments have rooted Esquel ever deeper in the Pearl River Delta, where it can draw on the region’s pool of textile workers. “You pay for the brain as well as the hands,” Ms Yang says of her workers. “For us stability is most important so we can use our management skills to deal with external problems.”"
634;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-03-09T17:00:55Z;Nike sees ‘gaps’ in China labour laws;;Workers at Nike’s contract factories in China do not enjoy the same protection as their peers elsewhere because of “gaps” in the country’s labour laws, the global footwear giant has said in a report.“We commend the important steps taken by the Chinese government to increase protection of workers’ rights,” Nike said in an inaugural report on its corporate social responsibility initiatives in China, where it works with some 180 factories employing about 210,000 workers.“However, when comparing Chinese law with the basic protections outlined under the [International Labour Organisation] Convention, there are gaps in protection that workers elsewhere enjoy.”The report is part of a larger effort by Nike to increase the transparency of its operations in China – where the company sources 35 per cent of its footwear – before this summer’s Olympic games in Beijing. Nike also implied that China’s existing labour protection regime, although boosted by this year’s implementation of a new labour contract law, falls short of standards set by the ILO.“We encourage all governments to recognise and respect the principles embodied in ILO Conventions 87 and 98 regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining,” the report said, without citing China specifically.Nike was an early supporter of China’s labour contract law, which enhances collective bargaining rights. “We endorsed it because we thought it was a good thing,” said Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility.China’s only government-approved union, the All China Federation of Trade Unions, is represented in about half of Nike’s contract footwear, apparel and other sporting equipment factories across the country.Activists hope that the new labour contract law could lead to the establishment of more independent unions at companies where the official union is not represented.

Then the Panama Canal crash, followed by the Wall Street boom and bust of the Roaring Twenties. More recently, there has been the dotcom delirium, and now the US subprime extravaganza.But even before the latest banking bubble has fully burst, there are signs of a new madness taking hold of sports companies as they try to outbid each other for the rights to kit out national soccer teams.Take Nike. The US company has just agreed to pay a staggering €320m ($474m) to become the equipment supplier to the French Football Federation for a 7½-year period starting in 2011. It will thus pay the French national football squad €42.7m a year – a record for such a deal. This is even more than the equivalent of €35m a year that is being paid by Umbro, the UK sporting goods company that Nike is acquiring for £285m, for the rights to kit out the England team. But it is still not as much as the €50m a year Nike was prepared to pay for the rights to supply the German national team. And far more than the €10m a year it pays Brazil or the €16m a year that Puma forks out to the world soccer champions, Italy.France can therefore now boast the most expensive national football jersey in the world. All because Nike was determined to break up the 37-year relationship between the French national team and its main rival, Adidas, the German sports equipment group. Although it easily outbid the Germans in the recent competition for the rights to equip the German national team, the Americans lost out to Germanic economic patriotism.The country’s football federation preferred to maintain their half-century association with Adidas, although the traditional German equipment supplier had to dig deeper into its pocket and agree to pay €25m a year instead of the current €11m for the privilege of seeing off Nike’s attempted blockbuster €50m-a-year proposal.The Americans are making no secret of their ambition to topple Adidas as the top maker of soccer apparel by the 2010 World Cup. The US company has been building up its football revenues from about $40m in the early 1990s to about $1.5bn last year.Sure, securing significant kit sponsorship deals for some of Europe’s leading national teams should help boost sales. But at such heady prices, will they also help boost profits?Losing out to Nike in France does not seem to have unduly upset Adidas. The Germans say they made an offer that they considered was at the “limit of reason”. Not only will Adidas still be equipping the French team for the 2010 World Cup, but investors seem to be relieved that the German group is not prepared to engage in crazy football bidding wars with Nike.

Then the Panama Canal crash, followed by the Wall Street boom and bust of the Roaring Twenties. More recently, there has been the dotcom delirium, and now the US subprime extravaganza.But even before the latest banking bubble has fully burst, there are signs of a new madness taking hold of sports companies as they try to outbid each other for the rights to kit out national soccer teams.Take Nike.

Not only has the future of his bank been in doubt after an unprecedented trading fraud, but his own tenure has also looked shaky to say the least.Mr Bouton, quite correctly, offered to resign – not once, but twice – when the scandal broke. His board rejected his offers, concerned to stabilise the bank rather than add to the instability by trying to find someone willing to step into a volatile and highly uncertain situation.Apart from the financial hit suffered by the bank, the predators have started to circle. Whether they eventually bid or not, rivals such as BNP Paribas are clearly taking every opportunity to weaken their destabilised competitor further. BNP Paribas would probably love to see Mr Bouton go because he has always defended fiercely his bank’s independence and thwarted his rival’s ambitions to take over SocGen.But Mr Bouton is now showing every intention of staying. In a French newspaper interview he said his resignation was no longer on the table. He added: “I am staying, I am the pilot, I am in the driving seat – there must be no doubt about that.” If that message was not sufficiently clear, he also suggested that the board was not considering at this stage splitting his dual role as chairman and chief executive – even though this is one of the very proposals put forward in the French governance code that bears his name.It is encouraging to see Mr Bouton recover some of his old fighting spirit. But surely it is not up to him to decide whether he will stay or go. The board may have supported him twice, but privately many directors have acknowledged that at some stage the question of his departure will arise. As for splitting his dual role, the board may well reconsider this issue, which is already the subject of internal debate. And what about SocGen’s shareholders? They are bound to have something to say at the bank’s annual meeting in May.european.view@ft.com
637;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-02-05T18:12:44Z;Sports Direct in China alliance;;Sports Direct, the sportswear company controlled by entrepreneur Mike Ashley, is to venture into China to exploit brands that include Dunlop and Slazenger.Although predominantly a UK retailer, the company has a large and growing roster of labels, which it will sell into ITAT Group stores across China.Most of Sports Direct’s brands, which also include Lonsdale and Donnay, are sold through its own stores at higher margin than bought-in products from Nike and Adidas, the biggest sportswear companies.In the “strategic alliance” announced on Tuesday Sports Direct will invest up to £20m in the next year to fit out 120 ITAT stores. The move would have “minimal earnings impact” in the first year, the company said.ITAT has more than 700 stores in 275 Chinese cities. Sports Direct is not the first British sports company to see the potential of the fast-growing Chinese market. Umbro, the Cheshire-based sportswear brand being acquired by Nike, has a large Chinese presence.Sports Direct, which has struggled since its flotation last February amid profit warnings and corporate governance concerns, enjoyed another fillip on Tuesday with its first analyst’s “buy” recommendation in months.Jonathan Pritchard of Oriel Securities said it was “time for a change of heart” after a visit to Sports Direct’s headquarters at Shirebrook, Nottinghamshire. “Our due diligence has shown that the business controls are indeed firmly in place and the retail model is sound,” he said.Most analysts, including company broker Merrill Lynch, have rated Sports Direct as a “sell” based on a weakening outlook for UK consumer spending and the apparent failure of a strategy to drive profits by increasing gross margin.“If the press and the average post-float analyst’s reports were to be believed, the Sports Direct business model has been put together on a wing and a prayer, the [profit and loss account] is all smoke and mirrors and Mike Ashley is public enemy number one,” Mr Pritchard noted. “The truth is somewhat more mundane.”Shares in Sports Direct, which floated last year at 300p, rose 5p to 110¾p.
638;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-30T22:11:28Z;Nike supplier kicks off HK issue;;Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a leading maker of sports shoes for brands such as Nike, is expected to raise about $750m through a Hong Kong listing of its retail business this year.The listing of its Pou Sheng International subsidiary, which operates in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong under its own YY Sports brand and in licensed outlets such as Reebok shops, could raise up to $1bn depending on market conditions, according to people familiar with the situation.The planned listing highlights the long-term bullishness in China’s growth story and in particular, the positive outlook for private enterprises that cater to the mainland’s fast-growing retail and consumer market. Several China-focused retail companies, including clothing and shoe makers, successfully listed last year and are now trading strongly.Yue Yuen first flagged its plans to spin off Pou Sheng last month. The unit operates in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, including under its own YY Sports brand and in licensed outlets such as Reebok shops.Yue Yuen’s retail sales climbed nearly 50 per cent to $489m in the year to September last year, representing about 12 per cent of its group turnover. The spin-off will require the agreement of Yue Yuen shareholders.The decision to press ahead with a listing comes as the market for China IPOs experiences its most volatile period for more than a year.At least five China IPOs in Hong Kong, worth a combined $2bn, have been shelved over the past few days amid the turbulent equity markets.Among them were Maoye International, a mainland department store chain, which pulled its $905m IPO last week amid the global stock market chaos.Hong Kong’s flagship stock market index has fallen by about 15 per cent this year, amid fears of a US recession and the ongoing credit crunch.Dealmakers believe the China IPO market will be quiet at least until mid-February. This month several analysts predicted that China IPOs would repeat last year’s feat and raise more than $60bn with offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong in 2008.The bulk of the money raised will come from the listings of state-controlled mainland enterprises from sectors such as financial services, power and infrastructure.Yue Yuen has hired Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch to advise on the listing. Both banks declined to comment.
639;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-28T05:50:44Z;Jobs: Keep an eye on the storm clouds;;Business schools are keeping their fingers crossed that the credit squeeze affecting markets has not caused severe damage to the MBA recruitment scene, even in the financial sector.The September 2007 round of full-time recruitment – for MBA programme participants graduating this year – generally went well, with descriptions such as “surprisingly robust” coming from the schools’ careers services staff.But there is a sense of nervousness when it comes to predicting the final outcome of the September round as the on-campus presentations and opportunities have to be turned into real job offers, some of which may not be made until the following year.And there are concerns, too, over whether the effects of the credit squeeze could spread beyond the financial sector and into the general economy, which may take the wind out of MBA recruiters’ sails.“The career horizon is bright, but everyone needs to keep their eye on the storm clouds,” says Joseph Palumbo, executive director of the career development centre at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto.At Columbia Business School in New York, the main message from Regina Resnick, managing director of the school’s career management centre, is cautious optimism.“We are being very attentive to the marketplace and sensitive to what is going on,” she says. “We are continuing to reach out aggressively to [an ever wider range of] recruiters, and are reminding students not to put all their efforts into just one market but to look for opportunities across a range of industries and functions.”In Europe, Diane Morgan, director of career services at London Business School, says she detected a general feeling of nervousness in September and October: there were some indications that students were prepared to accept an offer earlier than usual. On the other hand, LBS had more company recruiters on campus than ever, “so the nervousness felt by everyone was not necessarily matched by a decrease in opportunities”, says Ms Morgan.Companies’ longer-term recruitment concerns are still a priority, irrespective of the events of July and August. “There is a recognition that these are associate-level programmes that are recruiting leaders of the future,” she says.There remains, too, a shortage of leadership within organisations, says Mr Palumbo, and this puts a premium on MBAs with five to 10 years of experience who can be leaders straight away. He adds that companies are struggling to find the right people, and as a result behaved quite differently last year: “They are getting more aggressive, investing more in their brand on campus, trying to get here sooner and to recruit in more innovative ways.”Some of the largest employers turned up on campus in the third week of August, the earliest ever, and before even the students had arrived, says Mr Palumbo.One sector that was continuing to show a strong interest in MBA recruitment during the September round was consulting, says Ms Resnick at Columbia. There were also more consumer packaged-goods companies on campus compared with the previous year, and more companies offering marketing opportunities.At New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, there were growing opportunities in strategic consulting at the top firms, according to Pamela Mittman, assistant dean of career services. There was also growth in a variety of industries with which NYU Stern has an advantage because of its location, such as retail and luxury, and media and entertainment.“We have been building relationships with the media industry for some time – but some of the retail and luxury and technology recruiters were new [to the full-time recruitment round],” says Ms Mittman. The school has been working hard at building links with these sectors, she says, while the students themselves have been doing a “terrific job” building relationships with the retail sector.LBS, too, saw a broadening of interest from the consultancy sector, with smaller, specialist firms wanting to engage with the school through jobs postings or careers fairs, complementing the regular presence of the Big Four and the mid-sized firms.In industry, there has been a greater diversity of companies engaging with LBS, says David Morris, business development manager in the careers services department. Nike, the US sports shoes and apparel group, came to the school for the first time last year, hiring MBAs for its new European management programme.Manufacturing also put in “a bit of a comeback”, says Ms Morgan, with companies such as Danaher, the diversified US technology products company, and Whirlpool, the US white goods company, coming to the school. “We are seeing interest on the student side in general management posts at companies making tangible products,” she says, “and that is matched by the interest of the companies themselves [in recruiting MBAs]”.In North America, healthcare organisations are starting to wake up to the need for MBA recruitment, says Mr Palumbo, following behind the pharmaceutical sector. Hospitals and medical businesses represent a huge opportunity for MBAs, he says.Another fast-growing area for MBA recruitment in North America is related to sustainability, says Mr Palumbo. Interest in this was previously limited to sectors with a direct impact on the environment but this has spread to others such as banking and consulting, where advisers on sustainability are in demand.The internship round can also provide indicators on the health of the MBA recruitment scene and the confidence of students. Ms Resnick says a very high percentage of second-year students came back from their internships with job offers. However, she adds, there is anecdotal evidence that the volatility of the markets convinced a number to accept the offers more quickly than normal – rather than going to more interviews later in the year.The next pointers will emerge through February and March as the recruitment of this year’s interns is completed. Schools are reporting a normal, or even higher, level of interest from recruiters in booking slots for on-campus presentations or attending career fairs.“There has been a significant increase in on-campus interviews over last year, and that is excluding all of the off-campus contacts arranged by less traditional recruiters,” says Ms Mittman at NYU Stern. “The students seem pleased and the recruiters seem exceptionally happy. One interviewed 26 students in one day, and said it would be happy to hire 22 of them, if it were able to extend that many offers.”The big question for MBA recruitment over the coming months is posed by Mr Palumbo: “Will the slowdown spread from wholesale banking to other parts of banking and then to all other parts of the economy as credit gets tighter?”If that were to happen soon, the recruiters that have been delaying making offers – whether through caution this year or because they prefer a “just-in-time” approach anyway – could decide not to hire at all.Ms Mittman says some of the non-traditional recruiters that base their hiring on need will continue to make job offers in March and June anyway.But she does not think the traditional recruiters – the investment banks, consulting and consumer packaged goods companies that determine their numbers quite early – will postpone their decisions.“It may happen that recruiters will choose to limit the number they hire, then come back to recruit again,” says Ms Mittman. “We have seen that happen in years where there has been uncertainty. But so far there is no indication that they won’t hire as many as in the past. All of us are aware of what is happening in the markets, but we haven’t seen any effect on campus.”
640;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Refugees need lessons for life;;Having endured militia attacks, weeks in hiding, an escape to a cold, distant country, years of peripatetic near-destitution and most recently a Christmas in detention, Adesole Adefowoju now faces a new problem: boredom.At Yarl’s Wood, the detention centre for asylum seekers near Bedford in the UK, the Nigerian 10-year-old spends her days in the same lessons as her sister, Deby, seven, and brother Dapo, six. “They give us multiplication and even the five-year-olds can do them,” she sniffs.It is their fifth school in two years. In the moments when the dread that flows from the constant threat of deportation subsides (and when she is not preoccupied with her ebullient eight-month-old daughter), their mother, Comfort, a teacher by profession, laments the damage to her children’s education.Their stories are repeated globally. From the camps of Africa, Asia and the Middle East to the west’s temporary housing, the world’s 15m or so refugee children are, by accident or design, the group most likely to be excluded from education, dealing a further blow to an already precarious future.Glaring holes in government policies are addressed in small, ad hoc ways by a patchwork of tireless individuals, church and community groups, non-governmental organisations, United Nations agencies and, on occasion, big business.“After primary needs – clean water, food, sanitation and shelter – education is a very high priority” for refugees, says Jill Rutter, an immigration expert at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a London-based think-tank.Apart from its intrinsic benefits, schooling is key to the long-term wellbeing of refugee children, she adds, whether it be by providing the security that a group identity and a uniform afford, or by helping them evade such perils as landmines, trafficking and recruitment as child soldiers. In practice, however, schooling in refugee camps and urban refugee settlements has been increasingly neglected.Those refugees who flee to the developed world might expect easier access to education. Many western countries theoretically extend rights to schooling to refugees from the moment they claim asylum. However, in the UK alone, Ms Rutter estimates that 1,600 asylum-seeking and refugee children go uneducated.A recent European Commission report found serious flaws in the provision of education to asylum seekers in 11 of the European Union’s 27 member states, including France, Italy and the UK. Even those granted refugee status face inadequate services, particularly in language-teaching, experts say. Furnished with scant explanation of the workings of their host country’s education system, refugees can find accessing schooling for their children baffling.In the US, a large, co-ordinated network of charities and NGOs, monitored and partly funded by the state department, assists the tens of thousands of refugees who arrive each year in resettlement programmes by, for example, securing school places for children. However, the state department says resettled refugees account for only 1 per cent of the global total.Businesses are beginning to contribute to plugging the gap, particularly by bolstering the capacity of voluntary groups and charities. KPMG’s UK foundation started to invest in child refugees’ education in 2000 due to a lack of business sponsorship in the field, says Neil Sherlock, partner.Working in collaboration with the UK’s Refugee Council, the accounting group has invested about $1.5m in projects aimed at influencing government policy for the inclusion of refugee children in schools.In an example of the difficulty the private sector faces in intervening in this most politically sensitive of areas, efforts by another of the Big Four accountancy firms, PwC, to deploy its staff to instruct young Burmese refugees in Thailand in elementary business skills have been blocked by the Thai government, says Richard Golding, who manages the firm’s relations with UN bodies.Outraged campaigners accuse governments of repeatedly seeking to use access to education as a lever to repatriate refugees. “Closing schools in camps is used as a ‘push factor’ [to press refugees to return home] all over the world, usually on the initiative of the host government. The UNHCR has few rights to object,” says the IPPR’s Ms Rutter.Ron Pouwels, senior adviser for refugee children at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, blames the removal of education in some camps on the logistical difficulties of managing repatriations rather than government intervention.Agencies say they face the problem of camps being seen by those living near them as providing “luxury”. “If we are going to fund secondary education, we have to be sure that it is already available through the state system to the host communities or that they can access services within the camps,” Mr Pouwels says.Often, the burden of hosting refugees falls on countries that are scarcely able to provide for their own.Jordan, for example, has a population of about 6m and has been struggling to meet the basic needs for the more than 1m Iraqis it hosts. The government has pledged to offer schooling to all child refugees but those who have been out of education for more than three years are ineligible.In Jordan, as in many other host countries, many refugee children fall through the cracks in state provision. “We are the only group helping kids who wouldn’t be able to go to school,” says Joy Portella of the Mercy Corps, a US-based charity working in Jordan. “We are filling those gaps where kids could be left without education.”Big business in class actionThere are two ways to view the move by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to enlist the private sector to help bring education to the estimated 15m children who have been driven from their homes by violence, hunger and natural disasters. It is at once a ray of hope in blighted lives and a crushing disappointment.Born of a desire to harness big business to the cause of raising awareness of child refugees’ plight and helping to raise the funds needed to ameliorate it, Ninemillion.org is part of UNHCR’s efforts to expand the meagre schooling available to displaced young people, with a target of reaching 9m by 2010 at a cost of $220m.But the body’s decision to seek long-term partnerships is also an indictment of the failure of the international community to prevent, or at least resolve, the conflicts that create refugees.The Ninemillion campaign began in earnest when Olivier Delarue, head of the UN body’s corporate and foundation partnership unit, dragged a group of executives to the camps of east Africa in March 2006.The companies represented – including Nike, Microsoft and Manpower – were all members of the Council of Business Leaders, formed at the 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos to advise the UN’s refugee commissioner.Since then, it has raised more than $2m through individual donations generated via a global marketing campaign and a snazzy website, matching grants from multinational corporations and auctions of merchandise including trainers designed by Eminem, the Detroit rapper.That cash goes some way to filling the hole in UNHCR budgets that has opened up over the past three decades, during which refugee numbers have soared, forcing the organisation to cut back schooling in the camps it runs to basic primary-level lessons in order to fund even more basic needs such as shelter and clean water.“Today the situation is bleak,” Mr Delarue says. “Our funding of education has been dwindling. Without education, there is no future.” The plan, he says, is to broaden secondary education and offer more university grants, as well as to raise access to sport and technology and help girls into schools.While Nike has fulfilled a pledge to match $1m in individual donations, the companies’ role is not primarily financial.Pamela Passman, Microsoft’s vice-president of global corporate affairs, says: “We know that our expertise is in creating software and tools – so we work with non-profits operating in local communities who are the real local experts.” Using the software giant’s MSN messaging service helps channel tens of thousands of visitors to Ninemillion’s website every month.On the same logic, Nike has supported Ninemillion by, among other initiatives, donating its considerable expertise in branding and designing a football that could withstand the conditions in a refugee camp. Manpower, one of the world’s biggest recruitment companies, offers business expertise and vocational training, but it has also often gone beyond those provisions by leaned on governments that host refugees to allow them to work.“More and more we find that governments do listen to the business community,” says David Arkless, vice-president of global affairs at Manpower. “We make a big contribution to their economy so they have to listen to us.”Mr Delarue says: “UNHCR in the past was not the best at implementing projects funded by private sector donors.” Improving that implementation, he adds, “is the role of the business partners”.
641;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-19T01:02:31Z;Bold steps into the arena of art;;When the likeable Texan athlete Michael Johnson ran his two finals, in the 200m and 400m, in the Olympic Games of 1996 in Atlanta, he wore a custom-made pair of lurid gold running shoes. The colour of the shoes was no coincidence. Johnson was widely regarded as the best athlete of the era. So his shoe manufacturer Nike (who else?) decided to anoint him even before the races were started. Johnson was the golden man. The rest could follow in the wake of his remarkable footsteps, fighting it out for silver and bronze.And so it went. Nike took its name from the winged Greek goddess of victory, of course, and lovers of classical mythology would no doubt have savoured Johnson falling flat on his face in the first 10 metres, thus exemplifying the hubris that lurks in ambush when confronted by crass triumphalism. Alas, this is the modern world. Johnson was in devastating form in both races, setting an astonishing record in the 200m – 19.32 seconds – a record that has not yet been approached – let alone equalled.It was, in retrospect, a defining existential moment for footwear: the strongest statement made yet by a pair of shoes. Johnson’s spikes became famous, not for any intrinsic virtues – flexibility of sole, lightness of leather, odour control – but for the message they were sending to the world.And it must have occurred to those in charge of corporate image at Nike that sporting goods – iconic, coveted by a mass audience, delivering of simple conceptual statements – had the same potential to say something about the human condition as any work of contemporary art. What was the difference?Which brings me to Beijing, and the fast-rising artistic colony near the city’s centre known as the 798 Art Zone. This is one of the most fascinating cultural developments to have hit the Chinese capital during its recent rise to global prominence.The giant factory complex was conceived in the 1950s as a joint initiative between the Chinese and East German governments, a showcase for China’s rapid industrial progress.But things change. And what was conceived as a monolithic demonstration of brute force gradually fell into disuse and became reborn as a multi-layered, underground sanctuary for a new generation of Chinese artists, seeking cheap, voluminous workshops.But things continue to change. And today, the 798 district is no longer underground at all. The growing desire for contemporary art, allied to the new interest in 21st-century chinoiserie, has turned the zone into a tourist destination, where visitors can indulge in those staples of modern experience: drinking coffee and shopping. They can stroll around the galleries and come across the impressive new Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, some cheapish print shops, assorted T-shirt sellers, and then perhaps perform, as I did, an elaborate double take as they see a substantial building proudly emblazoned with the words: “Nike Gallery”.It beggared belief, but there it was. Not a satellite of the Guggenheim, or the Louvre, or even White Cube, but the Nike Gallery, announcing its latest exhibition, Force of Love. Psychedelic swirls of orange and lime green (very 1960s/2000s) on the outside of the building welcomed me into a space devoted to various objects commissioned from Chinese artists that all featured Nike products in some shape or form. Yes, it really was as crass as that.I talked to some of the artists involved later that day, a trio of young designers who use the collective name “Unmask”. I asked them whether it felt like a sell-out, producing work for a multinational sportswear company that, among other things, was not known for its sensitive handling of labour issues in their homeland. They seemed simultaneously to get the point, and to miss it by a mile.Yes, they understood that Nike was a brand that was brilliant at appearing cool to young people, and that its artistic patronage of young designers such as themselves was part of that marketing process. At the same time, they willingly took part in “Force of Love” because they felt they had a “free hand” in what they produced (notwithstanding their common incorporation of Nike apparel).They felt liberated by the commission. It made a change, they said, from all those foreigners “looking for Mao stuff”. They were all, it ought to be added, wearing prominent sportswear brands, not all of them by Nike thank goodness, for that would have sent me running out of their workshop with an urgency that threatened Johnson’s world record.A couple of weeks later, I was in Florida for the Art Basel Miami Beach art fair. I received an invitation at my hotel. “On behalf of Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas, and in celebration of the brand new Y-3 store in Miami’s Design District, please accept our invitation to Y-3’s private gifting lounge during Art Basel this year.” And further down the page, an invitation to an outdoor video installation. “Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.”Well, yes, several actually. Here is one: when and why did sportswear companies suddenly loom so large in the cultural landscape? I remember the days – and it was only a decade ago – when the chairman of the Royal Opera House famously voiced his disdain for sitting next to someone with “smelly trainers” in the audience. It was an outrageously reactionary remark, of course. But I begin to feel nostalgic for a time when shoes knew their place, and stayed there.peter.aspden@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/aspden
642;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-15T23:20:03Z;Europe battles South Korean shipbuilders;;Every student of history should remember the Battle of Lepanto. For those who might have forgotten, it took place in 1571 in the waters off western Greece and was the last major naval battle to be fought solely between rowing vessels.The Holy League, a coalition of the Republic of Venice, the Papacy, Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy, the Knights of Malta, routed the Ottoman fleet. As a result, the Holy League gained temporary control of the Mediterranean, protected Rome from invasion, and stopped the Ottomans from advancing into Europe.More than fourcenturies later, a coalition of European interests is being formed to block what they consider is an undesirable and extremely dangerous incursion by the South Koreans into European shipbuilding. Brussels, too, has launched an in-depth investigation into the recent acquisition by the South Korean STX shipbuilding group of a 39.2 per cent stake in Aker Yards, the Norwegian shipbuilder and one of the world’s largest.The French were the first to sound the alarm. After all, the former owner of Aker Yards – the flamboyant Norwegian self-made businessman Kjell Inge Rokke – was considered in France as the saviour of the Alstom shipyards when he bought 75 per cent control of the Saint-Nazaire and Loreint yards two years ago.The French became nervous when he later sold his controlling stake in Aker Yards, and appalled when the Koreans moved in. So was the Norwegian group’s management, which has since enlisted the support of investment banks, including JPMorgan, to help them devise alternative strategies to contain the Koreans. And now the Italians have not only joined this coalition but indeed are being urged to lead it by their European partners, just as they did in 1571 against the Turks.The Europeans are worried that the Korean move will undermine their leadership in building high technology cruise ships and large ferries. The Koreans have already said they want to enter the cruise ship market and intend to transfer European know-how and design back home. Through Aker Yards, they now control the French yards that built some of the world’s most famous cruise ships and transatlantic liners such as the Normandy and more recently the Queen Mary 2.As for Fincantieri, Italy’s state-owned shipbuilding group, it has become the world’s leading cruise ship manufacturer and would have everything to lose if the Koreans entered the market and acquired European cruise ship expertise via Aker’s French and Finnish yards. First at a December Franco-Italian summit in Nice and subsequently during a visit to Rome, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has discussed with Italian premier Romano Prodi the possibility of a European response to the Korean threat. The idea, which is gaining growing industry and political support across Europe (the Germans are also worried) would be for Fincantieri to merge with Aker Yards and take control of the Norwegian group.This would involve a friendly bid and, as an added bonus, would finally enable the Italian government to privatise part of the Italian shipbuilding group.Rome has wanted to open up Fincantieri’s capital for months. And, given the company’s fine financial and industrial form, the management has also been dying for a flotation to support further growth and expansion. The problem is that one small, but radical, union has been opposing any state sell-off and has managed to block the process. Rather than acting as the South Koreans’ secret weapon, perhaps it will have a change of heart and not seek to block such a once in a lifetime opportunity for Fincantieri to consolidate its own European leadership and see off the Korean threat at the same time.Olympic challengeIt should be a great year for Adidas. With the Olympics in Beijing, as well as the European football championships in Austria and Switzerland, the three stripes brand should be as visible as ever in 2008.This should help the German group avoid some negative headlines after its difficult takeover of Reebok. Adidas is booming in China. Its biggest store should open there in May in time for the Olympics. And by 2010, the group should see its stores grow from 4,600 today to 7,000.Similarly, the European football championships – coupled with competitions such as the African Cup of Nations, Super Bowl and NBA All-Star Event – will all allow Adidas to show off its brand in a way it never did a decade ago, a triumph of sports marketing that rival Nike must also take credit for.But not all is rosy in the world of sporting goods. The economic outlook for the US, by far the sector’s largest market, is gloomy, with Reebok sales expected to slide further in its home market. Shares of Adidas are down nearly 15 per cent this year. Nike has threatened Adidas where it hurts, football, via increased market share and the Umbro purchase.Yet Adidas has done little to even scores with Nike in its main market, the US, in spite of Reebok. Adidas will have to show results from its $4bn acquisition soon: otherwise all the success in Beijing and Austria will not offset the damage that Nike could continue to inflict.european.view@ft.com
643;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-15T01:46:47Z;Cut-price clearance will eat into JJB Sports;;JJB Sports will generate lower profits in the second half of the year after Chris Ronnie, the sportswear retailer’s new chief executive, cut prices to clear old stock.The markdowns helped like-for-like sales rise by about 2.5 per cent in the six weeks to January 6 but at the expense of the gross margin, which fell about 4 percentage points on last year.Mr Ronnie became chief executive in August after acquiring a 29 per cent stake in the company with Exista, his Icelandic backer and is determined to start 2008 with a clean state.“It’s a bit like buying a second-hand car and when you give the tyres a kick they fall off,” he said of JJB, adding that the group had a warehouse full of stock that needed clearing.The challenge of breathing life back into the company got harder when England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 football tournament and Nike, the US sportswear group, agreed to buy Umbro, its smaller UK rival that makes the team’s kit.Mr Ronnie said orders for the new England kit “will be considerably less than we’ve ever ordered before” because of the non-qualification and because the design of the new England away shirt “isn’t as strong as it could have been”.Analysts at Citigroup on Monday estimated that a successful bid for Umbro could cost JJB as much as £6m a year “through margin erosion and cash flow pressure” if as expected Nike tightens Umbro’s relatively benign supplier terms.Mr Ronnie described that assessment as “nonsense”.On the apparent consumer slowdown troubling most retailers, Mr Ronnie said: “We are concerned about 2008. I think it’s a time where we’ve got to be quick on our feet and be a lot more reactive as a business.”JJB now expects profits before exceptional items to be “slightly below” the £27.4m achieved in 2007.Shares in the retailer closed on Monday 2¼p lower at 97¾p, meaning that the stake acquired last June by Mr Ronnie and his backer has lost 64 per cent of its value, falling from £190m to £68m.
644;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-11T00:01:47Z;Man Utd to carve out new global sponsorship deals;;Manchester United intends to carve out new global sponsorship deals as it seeks to capitalise on a fan base it estimates at 333m, according to David Gill, its chief executive.Announcing a record pre-tax profit of £59.6m for the year to June 30, up from £30.8m the previous year, Mr Gill said future growth would accrue from the first year of the new Premier League TV deal and commercial ventures.While rivals, including Arsenal and Chelsea, would also benefit from the TV deal, United could rely on factors such as a significant fan base “that set us apart”, Mr Gill said.New research commissioned by the club claims it has 333m followers, 139m of whom are so-called core fans. Among the core fans are 20m in Africa, which has prompted the club to announce dates for a summer tour to South Africa.“Our aim is to make sure we go after every opportunity afforded to us,” Mr Gill said, without specifying how many new sponsorship deals he was seeking.Richard Arnold, newly installed as director of global partnerships, will spearhead the initiative from a London base, an indication that the club’s American owners, the Glazer family, are assuming control of the club’s marketing strategy. Earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 72 per cent to £79.8m. Group turnover was up from 27 per cent to £210m, as the club benefited from a 30 per cent increase in match-day revenue after the expansion of its Old Trafford stadium to a 76,000 capacity.Turnover including sales from MUTV and Nike merchandise reached £245m.A strong performance on the pitch helped media revenues grow 35 per cent to £61.5m, and commercial revenues were up 15 per cent on the back of the first year of its £18m AIG shirt sponsorship deal, and new deals with Kumho Tires, Betfred and Hestiun.The turnover boost brought the club’s wages to turnover ratio down from 51.6 per cent to 43.6 per cent, below the club’s 50 per cent target. The club paid £2.1m to players’ agents.“We want to be as tight as possible on player costs, while getting the best talent,” Mr Gill said. “They are top players – we operate in a competitive marketplace.”Accounts for Red Football, United’s holding company, will be revealed in the spring, but are expected to show cash interest payments up from £27m to £42m, the result of redemption of half the payment-in-kind notes that are servicing a debt of £598m.Total interest payments are expected to be £67m for the 12 months to June 20 compared with £85m for a 14-month period following the takeover of the club in May 2005.
645;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-10T12:37:28Z;JD Sports bucks gloomy trend;;JD Sports bucked the gloomy retail trend with a double-digit increase in like-for-like sales and said profits would beat the market’s expectations.Shares in John David Group, the sportswear retailer’s parent, rose by 26 per cent to 353½p after it announced that like-for-like sales rose 11.8 per cent in the 44 weeks to December 1 and 9.3 per cent in the eight weeks to January 5.Better stock management helped increase the margin, prompting profit upgrades. JD concentrates on more expensive fashion-oriented sportswear in contrast to the cheaper clothes sold by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct.“Historically there’s been quite an endemic problem [with stock],” said Barry Bown, JD Sports chief executive. “We’ve improved the replenishment.”The strong sales figures are a modest indicator that consumers are still prepared to spend on more expensive versions of some products. Mr Bown said its own Mckenzie and Carbrini brands had perfomed “particularly well”, as had “some of the differentiated ranges from Nike and Adidas”.Sports Direct issued a profits warning before Christmas, immediately after the England football team’s failure to qualify for the Euro 2008 tournament, and JJB Sports also warned of lower sales. However, JD Sports – number three in the sports retail market – is not exposed to fluctuating demand for replica kits.The JD board is to seek investor authority to buy back shares, which would further diminish the free float of the company. Pentland, a brand management group that includes Speedo among a roster of sports and fashion labels, owns 57 per cent of John David.Mr Ashley, the founder and controlling shareholder of Sports Direct, owns a 10.1 per cent stake in JD Sports. Until retail stocks started to fall last year, it had been one of the best picks from an investment portfolio that also includes Blacks Leisure, the outdoor wear group, and Adidas.Mr Bown acknowledged that the JD free float would fall as a result of any share buy-backs but said the board would be “remiss” if it did not look to boost long-term shareholder returns by buying shares in a weak market.David Jeary, an analyst at house broker Investec, increased his pre-tax profit forecast for this year by 18 per cent to £40m. He called the sales performance “one of the most impressive in the sector”.
646;NKE;Nike Inc;2008-01-07T01:17:00Z;Limited options may put squeeze on flotations;;The £840m ($1.65bn) flotation of Moneysupermarket.com proved the highlight of a quiet 2007 for new stock market listings from north-western companies – and this year could be just as subdued if options for company owners and their advisers and bankers remain limited by the credit squeeze and expected economic slowdown.Chester-based Moneysupermarket was by far the largest of only eight regional businesses, excluding Isle of Man incorporations, to make an initial public offering in the past year.A handful of other regional businesses – including Stobart Group, the haulage company, and Cains, the historic Liverpool brewery – joined the stock market via reverse takeovers.There was also a return to the market for Norcros, the company behind brands including Triton showers, which delisted in 1999 following a management buyout.In 2006 there were twice as many new listings as last year – though none as big as the price comparison website. Phil Adams, managing director of Altium in Manchester, which advised Norcros, said: “There were fewer IPOs but they were higher quality. Investors became more discerning.“I don’t think this will be a stellar year for vanilla IPOs, especially in the first half of the year.”Colin Gillespie, corporate finance adviser with PwC in Manchester, said: “Companies are going to have to prove themselves that bit more than they used to, whether it is for a trade sale, a private equity deal or a public listing.”Moneysupermarket’s flotation ambitions had long been apparent but were scuppered for some time by the lack of an agreement between its two founders, including Simon Nixon, chief executive. After the July offering its valuation rose briefly above £1bn but is shares have now slipped back to a low of 124¼p.United Utilities is the only quoted company based in the north-west worth more than £1bn and the region’s relative lack of big-name public companies worries those who believe it will deter talented people from seeking corporate careers in the region.MyTravel and Enterprise head a list of relatively big regional companies to have been acquired within the past year and Cheshire-based Umbro is expected to be taken over by Nike later this month.Fred Done, the Salford bookmaker behind the Betfred betting shop chain, has recently played down expectations of its imminent flotation, citing market conditions. Mr Done had brought in NM Rothschild last year to assess options for the company, which is the fourth-biggest bookmaker in the UK with more than 700 shops and could have been valued at about £600m. He has said he intended to concentrate on increasing the size of the business.In a year when the FTSE 250 index ended down more than 4 per cent, PZ Cussons was the best-performing notable stock in the region, gaining 30 per cent. The performance by the consumer goods company was due partly to its strong position in Nigeria, where the economy is being lifted by high oil prices.Shares in NCC Group, the computing services company, also climbed more than 30 per cent, rewarding its decision to move from Aim to the main market.But many financial services groups suffered, with the region’s prominent cluster of debt restructuring companies as banks became tougher on allowing customers to renegotiate. And regional retailing stocks have suffered as expectations rise of a consumer slowdown.Natural pest control and food flavours help to drive growth in technological hothouseThe first half of this year is “potentially the most exciting” in the short history of Plant Impact, a Lancashire-based developer of products to improve crop productivity by combating environmental stress.Peter Blezard, chief executive, hopes to conclude agreements with some big agrochemical companies that will give Plant Impact access to global marketing – something he says is the “only thing the company is short of”. Mr Blezard says: “We are negotiating with some household names.”In its last interim results the company, which joined Aim in 2006, reported good trial results for its nutrient products for tomatoes, lettuces and grapes. However, the biggest hope is Bugoil, a natural pest control technology that is moving towards registration and for which Mr Blezard says he has rejected offers. The European patent office granted a patent application in September and Mr Blezard believes the US will follow suit.The company is one of a number of small agrochemical and bioscience-based businesses in the north-west – perhaps unsurprising given the amount of research conducted in the region by the likes of ICI, later AstraZeneca, and Unilever.But optimism has been scarce during the past few years at Micap, another business that was based on technology developed by Unilever. It was looking for uses for its yeast microencapsulation technology in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and the food sector, but has struggled since a relationship with SkyePharma ended in 2005.Mike Norris, the only executive left from those days, is steering Micap towards a future in producing flavours that cut costs for food producers, with help from Bill Mapstone, an experienced food industry entrepreneur and investor who joined as chairman a year ago.A new range of ingredients was launched in October and Mr Norris says Micap must turn initial interested inquiries into customers. “We have changed the business around and are no longer beholden to third parties,” Mr Norris says.

Hopes of further deals in the sector drove Anite 4.1 per cent higher to 50½p while Civica climbed 9.8 per cent to 187p.EBT Mobile China jumped 38.2 per cent to 19p as the China-based telecoms company said it had been approached by an undisclosed suitor that could lead to an offer.Eckoh, a voice recognition services company, closed up 10 per cent 6.88p as it too said it was in talks with an undisclosed party that could lead to a takeover. Eckoh emphasised that the discussions were at an early stage.Umbro closed up 12.9 per cent at 183¾p as Sports Direct, the sporting apparel group’s leading shareholder, sold much of its stake
to Nike, paving the way for an acquisition of the company by the US sportswear group.A positive drilling update from the Kerloch well in the North Sea sent Dana Petroleum up 0.4 per cent to 1361p, Granby Oil and Gas 12.2 per cent higher to 73.5p, while Antrim Energy, which also has an interest in the field, gained 6.1 per cent to close at 216½p.UTV Mediarose 2.4 per cent to 251.75p as several directors including John McCann, chief executive of the owner of the Ulster television franchise, bought shares in the company.Meldex, a speciality pharmaceuticals group, dropped 15.1 per cent to 55p, despite welcome news over licensing agreements.Development Securities closed up 13.2 per cent at 512½p amid talk of a possible management buy-out at the property development and investment company."
648;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Nike moves closer to deal for Umbro;;Nike has closed in on the “crown jewel” that is the England football shirt after Sports Direct dropped its objection to the US sportswear company’s £285m ($565m, €393m) acquisition of Umbro.The contract to produce the England shirt has become a tarnished prize since the team’s exit from the Euro 2008 tournament and on Friday it also emerged Umbro had a warehouse full of stock that Sports Direct, the UK’s biggest sportswear retailer, was refusing to accept.But more important for Umbro and Nike was Friday’s decision by Mike Ashley, Sports Direct’s founder, to sell to Nike part of his 29.9 per cent stake in Umbro for £56m and to promise to vote the rest in favour at a shareholders’ meeting next month that requires 75 per cent to support the deal.“We are pleased to have acquired this strategic stake in Umbro, which gives us a strong platform from which to proceed with our acquisition of this iconic football brand,” said Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike.Mr Parker told the Financial Times in October: “The England team deal is critical for the Umbro business to date and going forward. We see it as essentially the crown jewel in Umbro’s crown.”The acquisition, Nike’s first in three years, will increase its sales of football clothing by about 10 per cent to $3.4bn (£1.7bn). “That glass of [Christmas] champagne will taste sweeter,” said one person involved with the deal.However, the failure of the football team is still having repercussions at retailers. Umbro said on Friday it would suffer a “material impact on revenues” after Sports Direct refused to take its expected allocation of England shirts, arguing there was little demand.In spite of the pre-Christmas détente over the acquisition, Umbro refused to rule out legal action against Sports Direct to enforce a contract which would see the retailer buy 65 per cent of the England shirts manufactured by Umbro.Mr Ashley has said the terms can be altered to reflect reduced demand. That appeared to be acknowledged by Umbro on Friday when it said it would “support …the retail sell-through of Umbro product” – understood to mean increased discounts.Gnomic comments on Wednesday by Mr Ashley may have pointed the way to Friday’s resolution. Asked about the Nike situation, he said: “It is a bit like being King Canute on the beach, isn’t it? Oh dear, he was probably right – but in the end he drowned. It was his beach until the tide came in. They are very powerful, Nike.”Shares in Umbro rose 21¼p to 184p, the discount to the 195p offer principally reflecting antitrust concerns. Nike has said the deal will make it the biggest football brand in the world, ahead of Adidas.
649;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-12-21T12:43:49Z;England flop prompts Umbro warning;;Umbro has a warehouse crammed with unwanted England shirts that Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct is refusing to take after the football team’s exit from the Euro 2008 tournament.The sportswear manufacturer, which is subject to an agreed £285m bid from Nike, has a contract to supply Sports Direct with 65 per cent of all the England shirts it produces.Mr Ashley, who is the majority shareholder and deputy chairman of Sport Direct, said on Tuesday that he would not take a large allocation of shirts and that he would ask Umbro for credit notes for unsold stock.Umbro on Friday in a statement said it had not managed to resolve the stand-off with its biggest customer, which would “have a material impact on revenues for the current year”. It said it was “reviewing all options” understood to include legal action.“Umbro has contractual arrangements in place with its key customers, however, it is now highly unlikely that by the year end these key customers will have taken ownership of a significant number of England replica jerseys that are currently in Umbro’s distribution facilities,” said the company.The statement was prompted by a request from the Takeover Panel to clarify its talks with Sports Direct, which is Umbro’s largest shareholder with a 29.9 per cent stake.Nike is also in talks with Mr Ashley as the US sportswear company attempts to persuade him not to block its 195p a share offer, which requires 75 per cent of shareholders to vote in favour at a meeting in January.The wrangle between Sports Direct and Umbro illustrates the power Mr Ashley enjoys over his largest supplier and shows why he is concerned that favourable supply terms will deteriorate if the UK minnow is taken over by the US giant.Asked about the Nike situation on Wednesday after an interim results presentation, Mr Ashley said: “It is a bit like being King Canute on the beach, isn’t it? Oh dear, he was probably right but in the end he drowned. It was his beach ‘til the tide came in. They are very powerful, Nike.”He added that he may oppose the deal if Nike changed the terms of his contracts “substantially negatively”.Shares in Umbro rose 6¼p to 169p. Shares in Sports Direct rose 5¼p to 119½p.
650;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-12-19T21:46:04Z;Ashley turns it on for Sports Direct defence;;"Last year he was a secretive entrepreneur who avoided photographers like the plague and was not recognised by most of his staff. In 2007 Mike Ashley has reinvented himself as a football club owner who revels in the limelight.On Wednesday, the transformation appeared to be complete: the relaxed, smiling and forthcoming founder of Sport Direct was expansive in answering questions after an interim results presentation, forthright in criticising advisers and analysts – all while displaying unexpected comic timing and mercurial mastery of metaphor.Shame about the numbers. For all the circus around Sports Direct, there is a core retail business that is struggling. Underlying profits for the first half fell 35 per cent to £52m as a wet summer kept shoppers away. The full year will be further hit by current poor trading and England’s exit from Euro 2008.Meanwhile, Mr Ashley’s central role in deciding who makes that white shirt is in the balance before a shareholder vote in January. Sports Direct has 29.9 per cent of Umbro, the UK sportswear company that is the subject of an agreed £285m offer from Nike, its larger US counterpart. “We’re not opposed to Nike owning Umbro: that’s not an issue for us,” said Mr Ashley, causing Umbro’s shares to rise sharply.However, he later said Nike had not satisfied him that supplier terms would not deteriorate significantly under its ownership of Umbro. “They’ll never give guarantees. It’s more a case of making sure that they’ll absolutely run Umbro as it’s going on”.He said Nike was in a no-holds barred fight for supremacy in football sponsorship with Adidas. “They got beaten in the World Cup [by Adidas]. They’re sulking. They tried to buy the German national team [contract] . . . They’ve got a very very serious intent to get hold of Umbro and the England contract.”The fighting talk on Wednesday was mainly Mr Ashley’s: “I tend not to walk away from fights. Period,” he said of repeated speculation that he would take the business private. “We will get there albeit after a bumpy start. [dramatic pause; smile] Understatement.”One analyst with a negative view of the company – and there are many – was accused of tailoring his research for short-selling clients. “I can only assume that most of his clients are shorts or he must be a moron,” said Mr Ashley.However, he also blamed Merrill Lynch, the bank that brought the company to market and remains its broker, for not advising the City that there would be no like-for-like sales metric and not properly preparing the board for listed life.“With like-for-likes they were definitely responsible for not communicating it well enough. I would describe it as someone saying: ‘right we’re going out on a hike’ and you get on your gear and there’s Everest.”One person familiar with the initial public offering said in fact Merrill had tried to persuade Mr Ashley to adopt the performance indicator and had informed the City.Whoever is right, there is still a mountain to climb in 2008."
651;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike asks Ashley not to block Umbro bid;;Mike Ashley is engaged in talks with Nike as the US sportswear company tries to persuade the maverick entrepreneur not to block its agreed bid for Umbro, kit sponsor to the England football team.The talks are the first positive sign that Mr Ashley is willing to negotiate with Nike over its £285m takeover of Umbro, the Cheshire-based sportswear brand in which Mr Ashley owns a 29.9 per cent stake via Sports Direct, his retail empire.It comes as the Office of Fair Trading canvasses opinion across Europe from retailers and rivals to Nike on the US sportswear group’s bid.If the OFT feels the acquisition deserves closer scrutiny it will refer it to the Competition Commission in the next few weeks, a step that would slow progress on any deal and could threaten it.In the past 12 months Mr Ashley has changed from a secretive and publicity-shy retail entrepreneur to the colourful owner of a premiership football club in Newcastle United and a publicly-listed empire.Mr Ashley is not believed to have given any firm commitment to Nike to back its 195p a share offer and the US company is tightly restricted in what it can offer in return for his support in advance of a shareholder vote in January which requires 75 per cent to vote in favour.Nike is yet to reopen discussions with JJB Sports, the second biggest sports retailer in the country behind Sports Direct, which has accrued a 10 per cent stake to gain a “seat at the table” in deciding Umbro’s future.Both retailers are believed to be concerned that they will receive worse terms in dealing with a single Nike-Umbro supplier rather than two separate companies.Retailers and brands spanning Debenhams, the department store chain, and Puma, the German sportswear brand now owned by PPR of France, have been questioned over the deal by the OFT.Concern over the twin hurdles to the deal has depressed the Umbro share price since the agreed deal was announced. It rose 1¼p to 148p on Monday, still 24 per cent short of the offer price.Analysts believe the shares could fall below 100p if the deal falls apart.Umbro’s position has weakened since the deal was announced with England’s ignominious exit from the Euro 2008 tournament.● Another candidate for a board seat at Sports Direct has turned down the company. Alan Jackson, chairman of Luminar, the nightclub operator, has decided not to become deputy chairman.
652;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-12-16T17:00:57Z;How to make a little go a long way;;The concept of microfinance – small loans to the entrepreneurial poor – is not a new one on US business school campuses. Indeed, as they expand their globally minded curricula, many business schools have devoted more time and money, and sometimes even entire courses, to the subject.Other schools have gone a step further: the UCLA Anderson School of Management in California helps young female entrepreneurs in Kenya transform their poverty-stricken lives by starting homegrown businesses.It all started this year when Judy Olian, the dean of Anderson, was at the Fortune Magazine/State Department International Women Leaders conference. There she met Pauline Mwangi, who trains emerging entrepreneurs in Nairobi. Ms Mwangi was creating a pilot programme, “Young Women in Enterprise”, for Technoserve, the non-profit international development organisation. The aim of the programme, funded in part by the Nike Foundation, was to equip young women from low-income areas of Nairobi with business and life skills to start small businesses.Prof Olian happened to be assigned as Ms Mwangi’s mentor at the conference – a fortuitous pairing. “It was an interesting and easy fit for us,” she says. The Anderson school has a long history of working with students on microfinance-oriented projects, according to Prof Olian.“Her work struck a particular chord with me, because it was about helping young women. Many of the young women she works with live in the slums of Nairobi. They have no running water, no sewerage and no electricity. They have some basic education, but they subsist on less than $1 a day. The issue is: how do you lift them out of the cycle of poverty?“Her work is about educating girls on how to do business, how to keep records, and how to sustain a successful enterprise,” she says.“We are talking about tiny, tiny businesses, but they could change the lives of these women.”Ms Mwangi spent a week at Anderson attending classes and seminars on best business practices and skills related to organisation and management. She also met professors who specialise in micro­finance and worked with students who were interested in entrepreneurship in the developing world. “Learning how they think about microfinance and the developing world helped me think about how I could expand my programme back in Kenya,” Ms Mwangi says.“The most important lesson for me, though, was the realisation that Judy, my mentor, and the other women I met were so much like me. They face the kind of challenges I face. I saw that they do their best with the opportunities they get and that they stayed focused on their goals, not giving up. And I thought, ‘I can do that’. ”Her time at Anderson also helped hone her ideas for the pilot programme in Nairobi, she says. In particular, it gave her the confidence and motivation to try new approaches.“The dean’s office is a very busy environment and so many activities were going on,” she says. “As I fitted into the culture of the office, I realised I could do much more than I thought I was capable of. I am now more likely to try new things and take on more challenging issues readily than I would have done before.”The programme she created involved 260 young women, ranging from 15 to 24 years old. Most of the women had no business training, nearly half had left secondary school early, and more than a quarter had children.DonationsEach woman was given 100 hours of training in entrepreneurship and life skills through business clubs and schools. In addition, they received mentoring from leading women entrepreneurs and coaching from business school student associations.At the end of the programme, the women participated in a business plan competition. Many of the businesses “supply a need in the area that the girls live”, says Ms Mwangi. “They want to open a little shop to sell paraffin, or start a knitting business making sweaters for babies.“These girls are starting out very small, but their dreams are bigger. Many of them wrote business plans for larger enterprises – such as a dry-cleaning business, a soap-making business, daycare for small children, or a catering business. I am trying to help the girls become more creative, more imaginative.”The women presented their ideas to a panel of judges, which comprised local business people, business school faculty members and representatives from microfinance institutions. Of 260 women who completed the traineeship, 40 were awarded a small amount of seed money – funded through donations of individuals and companies in Kenya – to start their businesses.One young woman, for instance, won $429 in prize money to start a business that enhances secondhand garments with hand-sewn embroidery. Another won $355 to open a small grocery store for university students. “The joy I see on their faces when they win. They are so proud of what they’ve achieved,” says Ms Mwangi. “I feel that I am bringing hope to these girls.”TransformativeHer connection to Anderson continues today. At the moment, Ms Mwangi is working with a group of five Anderson MBA candidates on a special consulting project, looking into whether Technoserve ought to embark on programming in Kenya in the hospitality industry. The students are doing research and will spend a week in the country at the beginning of next year.“Microfinance is becoming a big part of the conversation on campus,” says David Weisz, a member of Ms Mwangi’s team. “It appeals to business students because it’s about leveraging economic principles to do good in the world. The beauty is in its simplicity.”Prof Olian is encouraged that her students have shown an interest in microfinance in the developing world. “This is a generation of MBA students – the Millennials – that didn’t grow up in an era of harsh need. They are post-Depression, post-Vietnam, and yet they are very concerned about doing good.”The professor has spent time with Ms Mwangi in Nairobi, observing the progress of the pilot programme. She is heartened that her former mentee has been able to put the knowledge she gained at Anderson to good use. But Prof Olian hastens to add that students and faculty have learned as much from Ms Mwangi as she did from them.“This is a two-way street,” she says. “It was a humbling and transformative experience to see how people can in a small way make a huge difference.”www.ft.com/businesseducation
653;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-12-10T07:01:45Z;Opinion: lessons from 25 supply chain leaders;;"Chief executives own final accountability. Shareholders want strong profit growth and minimum volatility. Regulators and the press expect social and environmental responsibility. Customers demand someone deliver on promises made to them. Supply chain management has become the key to meeting all of these commitments.Most companies, especially in manufacturing and retail, but increasingly in the energy, entertainment, and healthcare sectors, have seen supply chain management gain strategic importance in recent years. For those wondering what good supply chain management is and how leading companies exploit it, AMR Research has published, yearly since 2004, a report titled, “The Supply Chain Top 25”.This list features leading companies that have advanced supply chain from its roots in logistics, material handling, and purchasing toward the modern, demand-driven value network needed in our globalised, Internet-enabled, 21st century business environment.Twentieth century business was largely built on a manufacturing economy of big assets tied up in factories and production equipment. Supply chain management in this context meant feeding the factory and shipping finished goods, acting only as a support function to the real business of making basic products for customers.Today’s customers want goods that depend primarily on intellectual property (lifesaving molecules, entertainment electronics, creative design) and are built by companies tapping a global network of specialists to bring innovative things to people whose homes are already full of refrigerators, shoes, and shaving foam.This demand-driven value network approach is exemplified by companies such as Nike (No. 18 in 2007), which innovates with a brand and total consumer experience that supports high prices while keeping a close eye on operations across a global manufacturing and distribution network. For those who think Nike is all about marketing, consider that its supply chain has increased operating margins in each of the last four years: 2003, 10.5 per cent; 2004, 11.8 per cent; 2005, 13.5 per cent; and 2006, 14.3 per cent.The same can be said of Nokia, with the top supply chain in the world, which excels at supplier collaboration while still pushing technology and design innovation that reaches almost 1bn people worldwide. Along with Nike, Procter & Gamble (No. 3), Coca Cola (No. 13), and all the other consumer products companies on the list, Nokia’s supply chain serves the chief executive’s first master, shareholders, by doing more than just cutting costs.Nokia orchestrates the constant collaboration between supply, demand, and product management groups that brings profitable new products to market. Nokia’s share price has doubled in the past 12 months.The principle does not only apply to companies selling to consumers. IBM (No. 4), Cisco Systems (No. 11), Johnson Controls (No. 16), and Paccar (No. 24) sell almost exclusively to corporate customers. All, however, also depend on the successful orchestration of supply (manufacturing, sourcing, logistics), demand (sales, marketing, service), and product (R&D, engineering).Each company has succeeded for shareholders by integrating processes that allow them to operate as demand-driven value networks: orchestrating players up and down the supply chain with a combination of information, visibility, cross-cutting metrics, and market discipline.Paccar, for example, uses streamlined information systems and super lean assembly plants to deliver custom-built vehicles in as little as two weeks. The customer is happy. And shareholders? Paccar’s operating margins for the last five years through 2006: 7.6 per cent, 9.3 per cent, 11.5 per cent, 12.2 per cent, 12.7 per cent.Chief executives need to think of the supply chain not as a cost centre but as the orchestrator of a value network. Supply chain executives are accustomed to being measured and are often the best suited to devise and maintain metrics for operational and innovation excellence that can define a value network’s performance. Such metrics may be a better way to communicate with investors about future prospects and justify a higher price-to-earnings multiple.Our Top 25 has outperformed broader stock market indices by almost 100 per cent the 12 months following release of the report each year indicating at least some link between good supply chain management and increasing shareholder value.Another important worry for chief executives is also fundamentally a supply chain management issue: social and environmental responsibility (SER). A decade ago this might have been seen as merely public relations. Today, chief executives pressed to go green or get rid of sweatshops will find that almost 100 per cent of the meaningful action that can be taken depends on their supply chain executives. They are the ones burning the fossil fuels, processing the materials, and hiring and firing the people. They are also the ones who collect the data that shows whether these things are being done responsibly or not.Some of the most important pioneering work in sustainability is happening in supply chains where leaders such as Hewlett-Packard (No. 21), Wal-Mart (No. 6), and Tesco (No. 8) are taking a mega-scale view of their global footprint. HP, for example, uses recycled material for about 60 per cent of its metals consumption in manufacturing.Finally, consider accountability to the customer. Supply chains of the 20th century were inward looking, concerned primarily with factory throughput and cost control. It took a decade of leadership from the likes of Toyota (No. 5) to teach supply chains about quality. Today’s best are looking for the next level to become truly demand-driven. No. 3 Procter & Gamble calls it the “moment of truth” when a consumer chooses to buy and then use a product. Everything in P&G’s global value network is based on winning at this moment of truth.Supply chain management has evolved from a low impact cost centre to the essential means to drive shareholder value, global reputation, and customer satisfaction. CEOs interested in leaving a great legacy had better understand how this change is happening and what they can do about it. For a start, look to these Top 25 leaders to see how their supply chain management strategies are evolving and why they are stealing the lead from those who are still stuck in the 20th century.Kevin O’Marah is chief strategy officer for AMR Research."
654;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-30T18:09:57Z;A kick out of technology;;"They may not turn you into a Thierry Henry or a Fabio Cannavaro but the latest football boots from the world’s leading manufacturers are packed with enough technology to help any weekend footballer bend it like Beckham.Look at Adidas’s latest iteration of its well-established Predator model, the Powerswerve. Crafted from kangaroo skin – the lightest, thinnest and strongest leather for a sports shoe – the new model features a tube containing powdered tungsten, one of the heaviest metals, running the length of the outsole. When the player runs normally, the powder is distributed along the floor of the tube. When the player draws back a foot to kick, the powder slides to the front of the boot, adding 40g of extra weight to the “sweet spot”, the point of maximum impact.Or consider Nike’s concept boot, the Mercurial SL, constructed almost entirely from carbon fibre and said to be the lightest, fastest football boot ever made. A size nine shoe weighs just 190g. Technologies more usually associated with the aerospace and automobile industries were called into play to bond the seven layers of the sole. Nike’s researchers at Montebelluna, Italy, developed a technique for weaving unyielding carbon fibre into a soft and flexible upper. The pattern of the cleats or studs moulded into the one piece outsole is designed for rapid acceleration. Only 2,000 pairs have been made but they point the way to the boot of the future.Spending on research and development by Adidas, Nike and their competitors runs into hundreds of millions of dollars each year, a sizeable chunk of that going on football boots, balls and strip. Why? Of all recognised sports, isn’t football the one least in need of high technology? Don’t kids kicking around a cheap ball on a patch of wasteland have just as much fun as the professional and enthusiastic amateurs at whom the kit makers are aiming their expensively developed products?The answer, of course, is a qualified yes. But manufacturers are driven as much by the desire to give their customers competitive advantage through technology as to make money. Chris Walsh of Adidas says: “Technology is at the heart of everything Adidas has done. It has always been a case of designing the product to help the athlete perform.” Nike’s Phil Dickinson claims: “The thing we’ve brought to the sport is a consideration for the performance benefits the athletes are looking for.”These convictions translate into research programmes involving players at every level and university research departments. Adidas worked with the biomechanics department of the University of Freiburg in developing the Predator. Nike worked with colour scientists to develop a ball that can be seen clearly under floodlighting against the green of the pitch and the distractions of the crowd. It is bright yellow with, counterintuitively, an asymmetric dark blue pattern.The principal conclusions from the wealth of data generated by this research are somewhat similar for all manufacturers. So both Adidas and Nike agree that the design of the outsole and the arrangement of the studs are critical in helping the player accelerate over the all-important first 10 metres from a standing start.On a conventional boot, studs are arranged symmetrically on the outsole; the new designs feature asymmetric patterns that are better matched to the part of the foot in contact with the ground as the player gathers speed. And studs these days bear no resemblance to the stubby cylinders of yesteryear. Sleek and streamlined to penetrate and exit the ground more rapidly, they can be popped out to suit different playing conditions in seconds. The makers call the outsole and studs combined “traction systems” and the new designs are said significantly to reduce the load on a player’s knees and ankles.Nike offers three boot types, each with a style of play and player in mind: the Mercurial Vapor is for speed merchants like Cristiano Ronaldo; the Tiempo is a classic design for wizards of dribble like Cesc Fàbregas; while the Total 90 is for players who demand accuracy and control such as Cannavaro who, incidentally, prefers synthetic materials to leather in his boots. “If you don’t work in football day in, day out it may be surprising to learn that different people want different kit,” says Dickinson.Each manufacturer has its own special features. Adidas incorporates “smart foam” around the sweet spot, the top of the instep and forefoot, which most players use to take a shot at goal. The foam changes behaviour with use. If the player shoots at goal, the foam compresses then returns the compression energy adding power to the shot. If the player traps the ball, energy is absorbed, helping to kill its motion. Adidas’s most technically advanced boot, the Tunit F50+, can be put together in 52 different ways to suit a player’s preferences.“Everything,” Walsh says, “is about customisation.” Youngsters want to tailor their boots to their own liking – a different colour on each foot if they wish.The lightness and flexibility of the modern boot, however, has led some to question whether it provides enough protection for the player. Critics point to the metatarsal injuries that threatened David Beckham’s career before the 2002 World Cup and Wayne Rooney’s before the 2006 event. It is a criticism the manufacturers reject robustly, pointing out that there is no statistical evidence of any increase in broken bones since the boots were introduced. On the other hand, improvements in sports medicine – and a voracious media culture – mean that cracks and breaks are reported more frequently than before. The game and the pitches on which it is played are faster and harder, and players train and compete more intensively.Gerard Hartmann, a physiotherapist who works with a range of leading athletes and is an adviser to Nike, says: “It’s my view and that of sports medicine generally that it’s not the footwear but the demands placed on athletes, be they footballers or whoever. The twisting, turning and pivoting movements make football a very intense game and it’s like anything­ – if you keep bending a wire hanger it will be OK 20 times, and then snap the 21st time you do it.”Modern balls weigh the same as their leather forerunners but are constructed in a different way. A conventional ball is made from 32 flat panels stitched together to form a sphere. The Adidas match ball to be used in next year’s European tournament isconstructed from 14 panels of thermoplastic polyurethane, each of which has been preformed as a spherical segment. The panels are thermally sealed together and the surface is dimpled like a golfball to maximise flight and accuracy and to increase the time the ball is in contact with the foot.Nike’s equivalent has microgrooves in the outer casing and nitrogen-expanded foam as one of four layers designed to give the ball its stability and ability to store and release energy.All the top manufacturers produce shirts and shorts designed to keep players cool and comfortable. They are designed and cut in three dimensions for a better fit. Man-made fibres, which “wick” sweat away from the body and aid its evaporation from the surface, are extensively used in Nike’s DriFit outerware together with venting panels to keep the players cool.Kit is getting tighter – partly to prevent opponents from grabbing a handful of shirt but also to provide support for the muscles. Thermoplastic polyurethane finds another use in Adidas’s Techfit underware where bands of the material provide support for hamstrings and hold the chest open to help breathing.No matter how advanced the playing equipment, football is traditionally a game at the mercy of the weather. Overturning tradition means laying an artificial pitch, such as the one used at Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium.Once little more than green carpet laid on concrete, today’s artificial pitches from companies such as FieldTurf Tarkett, the market leader, are created from thousands of filaments of green polyester sewn into a base layer.Professional players say that the surface is slower than grass and can demand better ball control skills. The company is still working to increase the resilience and durability of the filaments and ways of recycling the turf at the end of its life."

656;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-27T02:33:07Z;Sports Direct in share buy-back;;Mike Ashley, deputy chairman of Sports Direct, edged closer to taking private the sports retailer he founded after announcing a share buy-back plan that could raise his holding to as much as 72.2 per cent.Sports Direct, whose shares last week fell to less than a third of their February flotation price, on Monday called an extraordinary meeting to approve a plan that would allow the board to buy back more shares.Meanwhile, Mr Ashley is expected to meet representatives of Nike, the US sportswear brand, in the next ­couple of weeks. Nike is attempting to persuade him not to block its attempted £285m takeover of Umbro, the sportswear brand.Sports Direct has acquired a 29.9 per cent stake in Umbro – sufficient to block Nike’s offer, which requires support from 75 per cent of Umbro shareholders.Sports Direct says it bought the stake to ensure it has a say over the future of Umbro, an important supplier.Of its own shares, the company said it intended to increase its authority to buy back shares from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the capital because such a move was “earnings enhancing”. Observers questioned why such a large buy-back was necessary less than a year after the retailer floated.Mr Ashley owned the group outright before selling 43 per cent for £929m ($1.9bn, €1.3bn) in February’s initial public offering.Since then, the shares have plunged from 300p to last week’s low of 96p following profit warnings and corporate governance concerns.The latest sell-off followed England’s failure to qualify for the Euro 2008 football tournament last Wednesday.Soon after the match, Sports Direct issued a profit warning in the belief that fewer England replica shirts would be sold.Since listing, the company has engaged in a broad share buy-back programme that has raised Mr Ashley’s stake in percentage terms from 57 per cent to 67.9 per cent.The retail entrepreneur has been asked repeatedly whether – given the company’s struggle with the City and the plunging share price – he might take the company private. He has at times hesitated but usually given the answer no.The EGM to approve the additional scope of the buyback will take place on December 19, the same date as the company’s interim results.
657;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-23T03:41:57Z;City sceptical on Sports Direct warning;;England’s failure to qualify for Euro 2008 will hit sales of replica shirts but analysts believe there is more to Thursday’s profits warning from Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct.“The profits warning could have happened at any moment in the last two months but Sports Direct has chosen to hide behind England’s Euro 2008 non-qualification as an excuse for not meeting expectations this year,” said Jonathan Pritchard of Oriel Securities. Sports Direct rejected the claim.Since the company is warning on profits for this year and its year-end occurs at the end of April – several weeks before the tournament kicks off – there is a widespread belief that the problems relate more to current trading than the potential impact of reduced shirt sales.Mr Ashley’s successful model has been founded on attracting customers with cut-price clothing and footwear branded with Nike, Adidas and Reebok and hoping they also buy his own brands such as Lonsdale, Donnay and Slazenger. Nike and Adidas are withholding from Sports Direct some of their premium lines amid concerns that their brands are being damaged by the retailer’s “pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap” display.Without such “footfall drivers”, fewer customers are lured into the store to buy Mr Ashley’s own brands, on which he makes a far superior profit margin.Coupled with corporate governance concerns – in particular the failure to appoint a chairman – the company has few supporters in the City.That is not to say England shirt sales do not matter. Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the shortfall could wipe £10m ($20.7m) from consensus profit forecasts.However, he added: “We believe that there is more wrong with Sports Direct than the sale of a few England shirts.”With Mr Ashley, the founder and deputy chief executive, due to face the City on December 19 to deliver interim results, his company’s standing has plumbed new depths.Less than 10 months after Sports Direct’s 300p a share flotation, the shares have sunk below 100p to close on Thursday at 96p, down 16½p.
658;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Business nursing football hangover;;Mladen Petric won’t make it in the footnotes of UK economic history, but the Croatian substitute’s 25-yard winner at Wembley on Wednesday night, which ended England’s hopes of qualification for Euro 2008, will be felt across UK boardrooms.For retailers, bookmakers and pubs, next summer without a single home nation in an important football tournament will either be painful or a useful excuse to hide behind residual trading problems.England’s abject performance will disappoint pizza delivery companies and electronic companies hoping to ride the wave of patriotism.Publishers will have to revise their sales estimates for tournament special editions.Eurostar, ferry operators and low-cost airlines can abandon hopes for a mass invasion of Austria and Switzerland, the host countries, by British and Irish fans.Like millions of England fans, some of these companies will curse the country’s footballers, get over it and move on. Sports retailers, however, yesterday revealed themselves as the biggest losers.By 7am it was clear that the repercussions from the failure of the hapless national team extended well beyond the sodden turf of Wembley Stadium.From Shirebrook, in Derbyshire, came the latest disastrous missive from Sports Direct – lower sales of England shirts meant profits at the retailer would undershoot expectations.From Cheadle in Cheshire came a similar warning from Umbro, maker of the England shirt, which said the effect on next year’s sales would be “pronounced”. In Wigan, Lancashire, directors of JJB Sports gathered for a board meeting as the company’s shares fell as much as 9 per cent.While dejected England supporters may shun the shirt next year, one man who still wants it is Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike, which priced in the prospect of England’s non-qualification. The US sportswear company has an agreed £285m takeover bid for Umbro and both sides insisted yesterday that the move would go ahead.Single tournaments can brighten or darken boardrooms, as ITV’s experience suggests. The rugby world cup boosted revenue by about £16m, thanks to England’s unexpected progress to the final.Television audiences for European football tournaments fall by an average of about 30 per cent when home national teams are not taking part, according to Initiative Sports Futures, a specialist media agency.Some analysts estimate a £10m loss in projected ITV advertising revenue from Euro 2008, the rights for which it shares with the BBC. While dismissing this as “speculation” the broadcaster did not hide its irritation at the Wembley catastrophe. “Clearly, it’s disappointing, . . . [we’re] not going to pretend there won’t be an impact on viewing spikes, but British audiences are familiar with European footballers and [England’s failure] is not going to cause the impact it might have been.”Initiative argues that 13m watched the England rugby team lose the World Cup final but at least “double” that number would have tuned in to see England play in a Euro 2008 final. This includes the upmarket young male viewers most prized by advertisers.Most television advertising expenditure is committed up to a year ahead, ITV pointed out. Nevertheless, England’s failure is badly timed. The broadcaster is negotiating 2008 spending commitments for ITV1, its main channel, with advertisers and their agencies.England’s failure will not help ITV’s cause. It now has a diminished sports line-up during the summer against the BBC, which will be showing the Olympics and Wimbledon.Kevin Alavy at Initiative, said: “Certainly this is going to impact ITV’s overall trading story. Sport is one of the few areas that enable broadcasters to demonstrate they still have mass reach. “That is sport for you: sometimes it works for you, sometimes against.”Bookmakers hoped the impact would be neutral. Ladbrokes bemoaned the probable loss of casual punters and put the estimated loss of income across the sector in the tens of millions. “England in a major tournament is great for sport generally,” Ladbrokes said. “It’s disappointing in that big long-term respect.”Coral, too, said it was disappointed, though William Hill claimed the impact would be “very small”.The pub industry was split on the impact.Ted Tuppen, chief executive at Enterprise Inns, the tenanted pub operator, said: “It would have been much better for some of our pubs if England qualified but not for others that are more food-based. Across our estate the outcome is expected to be broadly neutral.” The cost to Regent Inns, owner of Walkabout, will be significant. This month the group identified the national team’s possible failure to qualify as one of the reasons why it remained cautious about prospects.Does England’s failure make a difference? The British Retail Consortium said on the basis of England’s progress in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Euro 2008 could have contributed an extra £1.3bn, but will now be less than half that figure.One sports marketing professor estimated the total cost at up to £2bn. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics was altogether more sceptical. “I would have thought the impact in macro-economic terms will be negligible.”
659;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-22T19:51:46Z;UK sports retailers dive;;The gloom is spreading after England’s ignominious defeat on Wednesday in the Euro 2008 football tournament qualifying round.To add to the emotional blow, investors yesterday tried to quantify the financial impact on the UK’s sport goods retailers and manufacturers. JJB Sports shares fell 4 per cent. Shares in Umbro, the subject of an agreed £285m cash bid by US manufacturer Nike, dropped more than 2 per cent. And Sports Direct slid a whopping 15 per cent.The price drops are justified because this week’s defeat added salt to existing wounds. Umbro, which has provided the England team’s kit since the last time they failed to get into the European finals in 1984, has already reported a 58 per cent fall in sales of replica jerseys from national teams and clubs in the first half. Revenues are buoyed by big tournaments – last year, during the World Cup, they rose by a third. JJB Sports, the UK’s second largest sports retailer, which owns a 10th of Umbro, recently pledged to reduce its dependence on tournaments after reporting a halving of interim profits. That aim is more easily stated than achieved.But it was the country’s largest sports retailer, Sports Direct, holder of a 29.9 per cent stake in Umbro, that was deservedly worst hit. The company has a commitment, until 2010, to buy two-thirds of the England shirts that Umbro expects to sell in the UK. The shares have lost 70 per cent of their value since listing in February and, on Thursday, the company issued its second profit warning since July.Sports Direct and JJB Sports may both be tempted, as conditions worsen, to use their large presence on Umbro’s register to put pressure on Nike for better commercial terms. But their position is weak. Umbro’s shares are trading 12 per cent below the 193p offer price. Nike, unlike England’s football team, could still walk away with its head held high.
660;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-22T11:02:40Z;England defeat puts retailers on the defensive;;Croatia’s 77th-minute winner against England helped knock almost £100m from the market value of Sports Direct on Thursday as shareholders joined football fans in ruing a hapless performance at Wembley.The boot of Mladen Petric, who scored a late strike to lead Croatia to victory against England, also dented the prospects at Umbro.The controversial retailer alone lost £99.7m, or 14.7 per cent, after issuing a profits warning just nine hours after the football team’s ignominious exit on Wednesday night from qualification for next year’s Euro 2008 tournament. Umbro, which makes the England shirt, lost 2.3 per cent, after its own profits warning, while JJB Sports, which is the second biggest seller of the team’s white strip behind Sports Direct, fell 4 per cent.But it was the performance of Sports Direct, controlled by entrepreneur Mike Ashley, that caused most concern. Jonathan Pritchard, analyst at Oriel Securities, branded England’s failure to qualify an “excuse” for the warning.“Yes, the hit to replica shirts will be material but this is a business model that is broken and it is thus virtually impossible to put a value on,” he added.The view that the profit warning extended beyond shirt sales was rejected by the company. Meanwhile, JJB said it had not “expected to make much money [in the event of qualification] because of the poor performance of England”.Even as England’s standing in the football world descended to its lowest level for at least 14 years, Nike prepared to buy the sponsor of the team’s shirt.The US sportswear group is planning to publish details of its £285m takeover bid for Umbro on Friday. That will be a relief to most Umbro shareholders who expect to see the company’s shares plummet if the 193p-a- share offer fails.Mr Ashley of Sports Direct is also central to the bid’s success.He has built a 29.9 per cent stake in Umbro and is believed to be concerned that a Nike take-over would lead to a deterioration in the terms on which the shirtmaker supplies his group. JJB has acquired a 10 per cent stake. Sports Direct shares have fallen by more than two-thirds since its £2bn flotation in February. After a share buy-back programme, Mr Ashley now owns 67.9 per cent of the company and would be able to buy the stake he does not own for £186.2m.
661;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-11-17T02:17:38Z;Business joins football fans to support Israel;;Millions of pounds of business in pubs, betting companies and shops tonight hangs on the skill and industry of a team of unsung Israeli footballers.If Israel lose to Russia in the crucial European Championship qualifier in Tel Aviv, England will in effect be out of a competition ranked only behind the World Cup and the Olympics in terms of big sporting events generating economic value.Few pundits give Israel, and, therefore, England, much hope. England’s predicament has prompted Fred Done, the bookmaker behind Betfred, to offer a £50,000 Mercedes to any Israeli who grabs the winning goal.Businesses have taken England qualification for the finals of footballing tournaments for granted. With that comes a windfall every other year from the burst of patriotism that encourages people to spend on drinking, betting and replica shirts.England have not failed to qualify for a major tournament since 1994. In contrast, Scotland are one victory away from their first such competition since 1998.Adopted Israel fans on Saturday will include managers, bankers and shareholders in both Umbro, kit sponsor of the England team, and its predator Nike, the US sportswear group. Mark Parker, Nike’s chief executive, has said the England deal is Umbro’s “crown jewel” and one of the most valuable sponsorship deals in world football.Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, Umbro’s biggest shareholder, and its main rival JJB Sports suffer a marked drop in revenue during non-tournament years – when England shirt sales nosedive.As for pub groups, already feeling the effects of economic slowdown and the smoking ban, they need another knock-back like a leaking beer barrel.Judging by past tournaments, failure to qualify will cost pubs 25m pints, or a loss of revenue of up to £100m. Given that the pub sector generates £28bn a year in turnover, the loss may not be “huge”, says one industry expert, but then “no one looks forward to not making £100m of its ­revenue”.Mark Hastings, of the British Beer & Pub Association, said England’s probable failure would be “disappointing but certainly not disastrous”.Some chief executives think the impact of non-qualification is overplayed. “Clearly our business would do better if we qualified, but I’m not sure it’s going to make a massive difference – maybe 1 per cent off turn­over,” said one.Chris Bell, chief executive of Ladbrokes, said punters would still be interested in a tournament without England and Scotland, but he is still hoping tonight’s results go his way.Additional reporting by Tom BraithwaiteEditorial Comment: Heroes and Zeroes

Propped up on the glass walls are 798 models of Nike footwear in candy colours, electric shades, and materials from crinkle patent to butter-soft suede, resembling nothing so much as “Prada I”, German artist Andreas Gursky’s million-dollar 1996 colour photograph, capturing a variety of Miuccia Prada’s minimalist styles. Net effect: the Gagosian Gallery meets the VIP-only nightclub Bungalow 8.Sound like an oxymoron? Actually, it’s Nike’s first ID Studio outpost, a London version of the former Nolita/Manhattan-based invitation-only customisation service that enabled clients to design every aspect of a range of five Nike athletic shoes. The place became so chic that Leonardo DiCaprio hosted a birthday party there for his former girlfriend, Brazilian supermodel Gisele. Along with Puma’s similar operation in an intimate enclave within Harrods men’s shoe department – which offers both men and women the chance to create custom-versions that merge the label’s durable sole with an upper made in a choice of 10 shades of pliant Schedoni Italian leather – the ID studio represents a shrewd move by athletic giants to finally capitalise on the global footwear cult otherwise known as “sneakerheads”.Time was when this tribe of athletic footwear fanatics was composed of hoodie-clad teens and slacker twentysomethings. Today, at exclusive footwear boutiques around the world, nattily dressed thirty- and forty-something sneakerheads snap up prized models that are often kept behind glass. “Cats with disposable incomes,” said Tony Arcabascio, the co-owner of the upscale footwear boutique, the Alife Rivington Club, when asked to classify the clientele who, after ringing a doorbell, gain admittance to his ostrich-leather panelled, red-carpeted quarters in New York.Demand from the older clientele, reasons Arcabascio, is prompted by nostalgia. For an ageing hipster, unearthing a pair of brand new Adidas from its functional cardboard box and inhaling the aroma of rubber, nylon and leather delivers a Proustian rush, transporting them back to the first time they heard tracks such as “My Adidas”. It was this 1986 single – in which rap star Run DMC confessed to owning 50 pairs of the German sports brand’s shoes – that launched the sneakerhead generation.Designing your own pair of Nike ID costs a mere £50 to £145 and the Puma bespoke models are about three times that – little enough, really, when you think of the psychological and emotional rewards.The youth among this footwear clan have been known to camp out at cult shops waiting for a new sneaker to “drop” (sneakerhead parlance for “launch”), and then, after storming barricades that are often set up, to earn sizable profits by auctioning limited editions or an in-demand “collab” – a model produced jointly by an athletic brand in conjunction with an artist, rap star, celebrity or fashion designer – on eBay. This community generates news on hundreds of sneakerhead websites, and blogs critically review the one-offs continually released by big brands, alongside their four annual seasonal collections, all words closely monitored by athletic giants as well as the gurus sneakerheads worship, such as kingpin collector DJ Clark Kent.The multi-millionaire former ringleader of rap quartet the X-Men owns more than 5,000 pairs of Nike’s 1985 classic chunky basketball shoe, the Air Force One. Kent’s female counterpart is rapper Missy Elliott, the Imelda Marcos of the sneakerhead sect, who has a sideline designing the successful Adidas Respect M.E. sportswear collection, as well as her own collection of more than 2,000 trainers. Amassing 450 pairs of sneakers over the past decade Alexander McQueen, who last year launched a signature line of 13 Puma trainers, is the sneakerhead’s preferred fashionista, and says of his shoes: “I am slightly fanatical about them.” (His competition is Jimmy Choo founder and president Tamara Mellon, whose own collection is supplemented by a plethora of Nikes). The Samuel Pepys of this generation is New York DJ Bobito Gracia, who followed up authoring the 2003 tome Where’d You Get Those? New York City’s Sneaker Culture: 1960-1986 with It’s The Shoes, a short-lived, 2006 late-night TV show. Broadcast on cable channel ESPN 2, it chronicled the habits of rich and famous sneaker collectors such as film director Spike Lee.The point, says Edmundo Castillo, design director of luxury footwear label Sergio Rossi and the owner of 500 pairs of sneakers, is that “there are sneakers for all occasions”. To demonstrate, Castillo splits his collection three ways: some are in storage, others occupy a guest room in his New York apartment, and still others (250 of them) are on display inside his Milan home, including all-time classics like black Converse Jack Purcells. The rubber-toed tennis shoe, originally launched by B.F. Goodrich in 1938, was the first sneaker Castillo remembers purchasing as a child growing up in San Juan, Puerto Rico.“I was six and, from that moment on, I wanted more,” he recalls. Castillo now also owns 70 pairs of the famed skateboarding slip-on by Vans in an array of materials and patterns – velvet, plaid, patent, camouflage, plus a pair of limited editions Marc Jacobs released in 2005 – and vows they are “even more comfortable than bedroom slippers”. His trophies? Classic white leather Nikes, each featuring the swoosh trademark a-glitter with hundreds of Swarovski crystals. “They are so beautiful, I am afraid to wear them,” he admits.Perhaps when Castillo next visits London, Nike ID can help him produce some sparkly duplicates. But he’ll have to act fast. Appointments are booked through January.…………………..Trainer stopsAlife Rivington Club, www.rivingtonclub.com

663;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-30T21:07:53Z;Sports Direct lifts Umbro stake to 29.9%;;Mike Ashley on Tuesday took on Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear brand, by doubling his retail chain’s stake in Umbro, in an audacious gambit to safeguard his interests in the maker of England football shirts.The retail billionaire’s Sports Direct raised its stake to 29.9 per cent by spending £42m – 195p a share – to buy another 14.9 per cent of Umbro’s shares just days after Nike agreed a £285m take-over of the company for 193.06p a share in an effort to become the world’s biggest football brand.Sports Direct’s stake is just below the threshold a company can own without launching a full counter offer and creates an apparent stand-off between the $37bn US sportswear giant and the £830m UK retail outfit.Late Tuesday, Nike was considering its options and may lower the acceptance threshold to 50 per cent to push the deal through.However, sources close to Mr Ashley said the entrepreneur did not necessarily want to scupper any deal but wanted a say in Umbro’s future.“He wants to maintain a strategic stake, and the level of that strategic stake has gone up,” said one person familiar with the situation.Sports Direct’s shares closed 6.5p lower at 135.5p, while Umbro’s rose 3.5p to 193.5p.The daring move was typical of Mr Ashley, who has built his business into the most successful sportswear retailer in the UK through unconventional, but effective, tactics. He has revolutionised the market by buying sportswear brands, such as Dunlop, Slazenger and Lonsdale, which he then sells in his SportsWorld shops. By owning his suppliers, he can undercut rival retailers while still generating a strong margin.Umbro is important to Mr Ashley, who has a 20-year relationship with the brand. It accounts for about 10 per cent of Sports Direct’s turnover and is an important contributor to profits because the retailer has very favourable buying terms with it.However, Mr Ashley is not planning to buy Umbro. As the maker of England shirts, the supplier deals with dozens of retail distributors who would not tolerate the brand being owned by Sports Direct.It would also not sit easily with the Football Association, which would not want the England contract to be owned by a single retailer.“This is about the long-term integrity of the brand,” said one source. “Umbro would be less important in Nike’s stable, but it is a first-class citizen in the UK.”Mr Ashley is worried that Nike might fold Umbro into its own brand, replacing its diamond logo with the Nike swoosh on millions of England football shirts. He would rather Nike tried to roll out Umbro to other countries through its global distribution chain. JJB Sports also owns 10 per cent of Umbro, having bought the stake less than two weeks ago.The absence of an immediate bid for Umbro on Tuesday from Sports Direct suggests that the Takeover Panel did not consider Mr Ashley to be in a concert party with JJB at the time he raised his stake in Umbro.Mr Ashley’s decision to position himself to vote down Nike’s bid for Umbro creates a potential conflict of interest for Merrill Lynch, which is adviser to both Sports Direct and Nike.However, Merrill started working on the Nike deal months before Sports Direct bought any shares.Merrill Lynch teams advising Nike and Sports Direct also have no overlapping members, according to a person familiar with the bid.
664;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-30T19:54:35Z;Nike missed a chance to upset Ashley’s Umbro play;;For once, Mike Ashley has a rival in the Baffling Stock Market Behaviour Stakes: it is Nike, the ever-so-pleased-with-itself international sportswear group.Sports Direct, the retailer Mr Ashley founded, has increased its holding in Umbro from 15 to 29.9 per cent, buying at about 195p – the overall value of Nike’s cash bid. That gives Mr Ashley the ability to block Nike without having to ask for help from JJB Sports, the rival retailer that owns 10 per cent of Umbro. But he could have spent less and achieved the same with 25 per cent. The purchase also dilutes Sports Direct’s potential profit on its original holding – bought at an average of 120p – and will antagonise Nike itself.Presumably, Mr Ashley believes it is more important for Sports Direct to maintain its 2007-11 sourcing and distribution agreement with Umbro – one of only a handful of brands “licensed in” by the group – than to curry favour with the world’s biggest sportswear company. He may have a point. If he allowed Umbro to fall to Nike, he would lose a hold over sales of the England football kit and give the US company the ability to grind down his margins. As buyers of his own super-cheap branded goods, from Dunlop to Lonsdale, know, only one man is allowed to grind down Sports Direct’s margins, and that is Mr Ashley himself. Given that Nike’s principles are already at odds with his pile-’em-high, sell-’em-cheap approach, Mr Ashley must have calculated that he didn’t have much to lose in annoying the Americans, even if the high-risk gambit (again) ill befits a publicly listed company. Sports Direct investors can only hope he is right.Nike’s behaviour also looks odd. As a multinational with an eye on the prize of becoming the biggest brand in world football, it surely could have pre-empted Mr Ashley by sweeping up the same Umbro shares he bought, even at the risk of having to up its £285m bid. Instead, the sportswear behemoth now faces what could be weeks of haggling with the notoriously hard-headed and unpredictable founder of a British retail chain a 20th of its size. Whatever happened, Nike did not “just do it”.China’s new African friendsIt is awkward when your new best friend decides to play with someone else. Barclays – and its 60 per cent-owned South African subsidiary Absa – might therefore feel a little queasy at news that China Development Bank has signed a potentially far-reaching deal with Nigeria’s United Bank for Africa, to co-fund infrastructure and energy projects in Africa. CDB only recently acquired just under 3 per cent of Barclays. That deal’s main aim (apart from financing the UK bank’s sweetened, but unsuccessful, offer for ABN Amro) was to improve Barclays’ access to China. But it was also supposed to help it mine the increasingly rich seam of commercial activity between China and Africa.The UBA deal doesn’t seem to infringe the CDB-Barclays arrangement. CDB agreed not to enter into a similar collaboration “with another major banking institution with global operations” – a title to which UBA, with branches in Nigeria and Ghana, can only aspire. Barclays has no direct presence in Nigeria and the part of its CDB deal most relevant to African business relates to co-operation on commodities products, rather than infrastructure investment. The direct shareholding and the (as yet unconsummated) agreement that CDB will appoint a director to Barclays’ board give the Barclays-CDB link backbone that the UBA-CDB venture lacks.But UBA says the Chinese bank’s backing will help it expand rapidly into a dozen other African countries. That could mean that UBA bankers – backed by what the Nigerian bank’s chief executive hyperbolically describes as “an almost infinite amount of [Chinese] capital” – will compete with Barclays and Absa to channel funds to corporate or public-sector projects. Together with the recently announced alliance between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Standard Bank, it makes for quite a crowd around the China-Africa negotiating table.Long wait for the lifeboatIt is impossible to be sure why Royal Bank of Scotland was unable to tie up the refinancing of Cheyne Finance, the troubled structured investment vehicle (SIV), before its period of exclusivity ended. One interpretation is that credit markets are too turbulent to execute such a workout quickly. Another is that creditors, rather than take a haircut now, are holding out for the US “superfund” lifeboat. Receivers for Cheyne Finance suggested this month they would be interested in selling assets to the superfund, being set up by US banks with government blessing. But two months is a long time to cling to the wreckage. If the far-off promise of salvation from the superfund stops market-driven solutions being achieved now, that will be bad news for the whole stricken sector.
665;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-24T16:32:52Z;The right side of reality;;"Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want
By James Gilmore and Joseph Pine
Harvard Business School Press $26.95/£15.99For Joseph Pine and James Gilmore, the Niketown store in midtown Manhattan may just have become a little more “real”. The store has introduced a NikeID studio, where designers advise customers who want to use the company’s online tools to customise their shoes.The idea is proposed in Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want as an example of how Niketown could escape being what the authors call “fake-fake” – it is neither a town, nor, as a place built for shopping, is it true to Nike’s stated belief in “authentic athletic performance”. But by introducing ever more emphasis on shopping in the form of a NikeID studio, Niketowns could ultimately become more authentic. By celebrating the store’s inauthenticity, it becomes more authentic.Such down-the-rabbit-hole propositions are part of the challenge the authors, two consultants, call “rendering authenticity”. In their 1999 book The Experience Economy, they sought to analyse the emergence of businesses that make money from how their products make people feel – such as Nike and its “Just Do It” marketing.But experiences are not in themselves enough. Now consumers want authentic experiences. We want experiences and the things we buy to reflect our perceptions of our own identities. The fundamentally fake construction of a modern urban “farmers’ market” supports its patrons’ self-identity and is as authentic an experience as a trip to Disneyland. Products from Kraft cheese slices to cans of Arizona sweet tea clamour to be “real”, creating a seemingly limitless supply of inauthenticity.The authors set out to analyse the phenomenon and create businesses tools for assessing and “rendering” authenticity. Rule number one seems to be never to use the word “real”. Instead, consumer businesses need to understand that authenticity is in the perception of customers.With some practical suggestions, along with style, wit and passing references to Heidegger, Shakespeare and theoretical physics, they build on their handy “economic theory of everything” established in the earlier work. They divide businesses into five groups: those that provide commodities, goods, services, experience and “transformations”, or making customers somehow better people. They then propose attributes of authenticity that apply to each economic offering.Basic commodity goods, such as soap or vegetables, seem more authentic if they are “natural”, and goods, such as the iPod, if they are original. Services must be “exceptional”, and experiences “referential” by drawing on history and culture. Transformations must be “influential”, and clearly deliver some improvement.But in each of these areas, you don’t have to be real to be authentic. In one chapter the book argues that a visitor’s experience of Venice in Italy is as authentic as a trip to The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. The Venetian is artificial and located in a desert. But Venice has been artificially maintained as it is for tourists.This leads to what the authors call, with reference to Hamlet, the Polonius test – asking whether a business is true to itself and also true to what it says it is – and leads to Niketown being classed as fake-fake. Disneyland, which is not really a magic kingdom, but really does deliver on its promises to patrons, becomes “fake-real”. Universal City Walk in Los Angeles, a pseudo-street of restaurants and entertainment, is real-fake. Once you know where your business stands, you can set about rendering authenticity, and using it to shape strategy. This all comes together in a thought-provoking but not wholly convincing exposition of what they see as key polarities in the attributes assigned to each of the five types of business. In soap, a discussion of the real-fake Body Shop and Lush, its fake-real competitor, focuses on Body Shop’s tendency to re-bottle and re-cycle, and Lush’s focus on un-cut slabs of soap, un-coated bags and unwrapped product.Wisely, the authors note that not everyone will agree with their notions of what constitutes authenticity, as they range from Southwest Airlines to Legoland to Cabela’s, the US hunting and camping retailer whose giant stores include arrays of stuffed animals and real trout in fake streams. But it makes for an interesting read, if somewhat chilling for anyone concerned about the meaning of life."
666;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Pru’s Tucker approaches judgment day with clout;;They say chief executives have three years to turn round a company. On that basis, Mark Tucker, chief executive of Prudential, is just six months away from judgment day. His position is safer than is immediately apparent.Prudential’s empire spans the world but the UK life assurer has big problems in its home market. Tuesday’s third-quarter results showed UK sales dropping a worse-than-expected 8 per cent year-on-year.Things really need to start coming together for Mr Tucker. Next May is not just his third anniversary at the helm. It will also be over a year since he unveiled a restructuring of the domestic business designed to silence investors pushing for Prudential to be broken up.But the reality is that the business as a whole is in good shape. Prudential shares are up 54 per cent, to 744½p, since Mr Tucker’s appointment, having outperformed both the FTSE 100 index and the UK life assurance sector. The UK’s drag on its financial performance is being more than offset by growth in its US and Asian businesses.Shareholders should now be grateful that Mr Tucker robustly rejected the all-share merger proposed by Aviva, Prudential’s domestic rival, in March 2006. That valued Prudential stock at about 695p. But Aviva’s shares have slid since then. Using today’s share prices, Prudential trades 30 per cent above the value of the share-swap that Aviva was proposing.If Mr Tucker fails to deliver a recovery in the UK by early next year, he still has the option of selling the UK business. Either way, it might be sensible for him to reconsider his earlier opposition to a deal with Aviva now that he can enter negotiations from a position of relative strength. He has clearly proved that the share-swap ratio proposed by Aviva last year was unfair to his shareholders: Prudential’s market capitalisation now exceeds Aviva’s.A tie-up would marry Prudential’s growth with Aviva’s cash flow and give Prudential the scale to compete with other globally diversified rivals such as France’s Axa and Germany’s Allianz. Vindicated in the strategy he has pursued for the past three years, Mr Tucker could step aside with dignity and let Andrew Moss, his counterpart at Aviva, run the enlarged group. At 50, Mr Tucker would be young enough to take on a meaty role elsewhere. Three years ago he was on the back foot. Next year it might be wiser to quit while he is ahead.Umbro’s upsideNike’s £285m agreed bid for Umbro, maker of the England football strip, looks like easy money for short-term hedge funds who pile into takeover situations.There are plenty of moving parts that give the deal an element of risk. On the downside, Nike’s offer needs 75 per cent shareholder support to proceed. But Umbro has two unpredictable investors – JJB Sports and Sports Direct International, the retailers – who together have just over 25 per cent of the stock and could block the 195p a share Nike offer. That could send the stock plummeting to its recent low of 106½p.On the upside, an auction remains possible. Nike would doubtless pursue its deal in the face of competition, although any counter-bidder would need to be confident of securing the backing of the Football Association. That adds additional uncertainty – would the FA give its blessing to the England shirt being owned by Germany’s Adidas, given the national sensitivities in football?And shareholders may demand a higher price. Nike’s offer may be at a 61 per cent premium to Umbro’s share price before the takeover interest leaked, but it is only about 5 per cent above where the shares were five months ago.The risks are balanced to the upside. It would be unwise of either JJB or Sports Direct to play hard ball with such an important sportwear supplier as Nike by threatening to shoot down its offer for Umbro. Even if they rejected the bid, Nike could rejig the offer to have an acceptance hurdle of 50.1 per cent. True, JJB and Sports Direct could stay invested. But again, only at the expense of annoying a key supplier. They would not receive dividends either.Buying the stock even at Tuesday’s closing price looks like a relatively low-risk, low-return trade. But how galling for the suede brogue-wearing hedge fund managers that the real winner here is that jeans-clad scruff, Mike Ashley, Sports Direct’s maverick founder, who mopped up Umbro shares when they were in the dumps in September.Money talksLow & Bonar’s plan to pay the chief executive a bonus of 750 per cent of base salary has been approved by shareholders. Only 9 per cent of those expressing a view objected to this generous three-year incentive scheme, but another 20 per cent abstained.If that is not a protest vote, it is at least evidence that investors are at a loss when it comes to deciding what top executives should be paid. Boards should take notice. Rightly, they do not want to underpay executives. But the episode underscores how vital it is that boards consult widely with shareholders on pay matters – not just the top 10 investors, but the massed ranks too.
667;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Three lions are crown jewels for Nike;;Three lions on an Umbro shirt – that was the picture back in 1966 when England last won the football World Cup. And although the team’s fortunes have since waxed and waned, the Football Association has kept faith with the sportswear manufacturer as kit sponsor for most matches since.Umbro, meanwhile, has suffered the earnings volatility of a company dependent on the mercurial talents of a bunch of footballers: when the team loses a match – or, worse, fails to qualify for an international tournament – sales of replica kit plummet.But Nike’s £285m bid – a 61 per cent premium to last week’s share price – shows how much value the largest sportswear company in the world attaches to the white England shirt.Not only the preserve of beer-bellied travelling fans but football fashionistas the world over, the US company sees it as central to its plan to be number one in the sport.“The England team deal is critical for the Umbro business to date and going forward. We see it as essentially the crown jewel in Umbro’s crown,” said Mark Parker, chief executive of Nike.“We expect it [the contract] to continue beyond 2014 but we wouldn’t want to speculate.”Even England losing to Russia last week in a crucial qualifying match for Euro 2008 has not deterred Nike or encouraged them to pitch a low price. “It has been nothing to do with what’s going on with the England team …we’ve been talking for a few weeks.”Steve Makin, chief executive of Umbro, celebrated the deal, adding his company needed an injection of capital to grow and the “financial and also brand firepower that Nike can bring”.Mr Parker said that with the tremendous growth Nike had enjoyed in the football market over recent years and the Umbro acquisition, he was now ahead of Adidas as football’s couturier-in-chief.The acquisition, Nike’s first in three years, will increase its sales of football clothing by about 10 per cent to $3.4bn (£1.4bn).People on both sides of the deal yesterday added that assessing the size of and market shares in the football market was very difficult. However, research commissioned by Umbro and presented to institutional investors earlier this year showed the UK sportswear company’s best guess.The figures, obtained by the Financial Times, show Nike would somersault Adidas into top spot and it could spark competition inquiries.In the UK, for example, a combined Nike-Umbro would sponsor 12 of the 20 Premier League clubs. One person familiar with the research added the caveat that precise like-for-like measurements between the kit sponsors were impossible.The deal could still be scuppered by a counterbid from Adidas or blocking tactics from Sports Direct and JJB Sports, which between them hold more than 25 per cent of Umbro.Mr Parker said Nike had “reached out” to the retailers – which dominate the UK distribution of sportswear – but would not disclose anything further.The retailers, meanwhile, are worried – in spite of the handsome profits on their stakes – about the concentration of brands among two large international players.They were not reassured by Mr Makin’s comments yesterday that “it’s a good deal for customers both large and small”.If they both refuse to accept the deal under the proposed scheme of arrangement requiring 75 per cent support, Nike and its bankers face an uncomfortable stand-off with shareholders who happen to be the only way to market in the UK.A counterbid from Adidas would attract problems. As a recommended deal, the German sportswear group would be forced to pay a sizeable break fee on top of an already premium price and endure jingoistic tabloid headlines, say several bankers familiar with the industry.But the most likely reason for failure would be that competition authorities use their veto.One leading analyst said yesterday there was “absolutely” a case to answer in spite of the blithe comments from Nike and Umbro.That would be bit like making it through the game only to lose the penalty shoot-out – not an unfamiliar situation where the white shirts and three lions of England’s football team are concerned.
668;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-23T18:13:25Z;Nike agrees £285m Umbro deal;;"Nike will somersault Adidas to become the biggest brand in world football if its £285m ($584m) bid for the UK’s Umbro is successful.The American sportswear company, the biggest in the world, on Tuesday outlined an agreed 195p-a-share cash offer for Umbro, whose rhombus logo adorns the England football team’s shirt.With the prospect of competition inquiries in several markets, both Nike and Umbro have stressed how difficult it is to define the market for football products. However, Umbro carried out research into the question earlier this year and presented the results to institutional investors.The estimates, obtained by the Financial Times, show that in 2006, Adidas had a 35 per cent share of football shirts and equipment, Nike had 32 per cent, Umbro 8 per cent and Puma 5 per cent.Nike would meet early its stated goal of becoming the biggest kit sponsor in world football by the time of the South African World Cup in 2010.There are obstacles to a deal: a rival bidder such as Adidas could emerge or Umbro’s largest shareholders, Sports Direct and JJB Sports, could stymie the 195p-a-share transaction.Both Sports Direct and JJB Sports, the biggest sports retailers in the UK, are worried by the concentration of supplier power among the two main brands.Umbro shareholders will receive 193.06p a share. They will also receive the declared interim dividend of 1.94p a share, bringing the total to 195p a share. That represents a premium of 61 per cent to Umbro’s closing price of 120p on October 17, the day before it announced it had received an approach.Umbro shares jumped 15.3 per cent to 190¼p.The recommended cash offer will be implemented by a scheme of arrangement.Nike already has irrevocable undertakings for 2.5 per cent of the shares from Umbro’s directors that would remain binding in the event of a competing offer.Merrill Lynch is advising Nike; JPMorgan Cazenove is advising Umbro.Over the past decade, Nike has been snapping at the heels of Adidas, the German sportswear giant which has strong ties with Fifa, the world football governing body.“Umbro is a brand with a powerful heritage and deep experience in the world’s most popular sport and the world’s biggest football market [the UK],” said Mark Parker, Nike chief executive.Nike has won the backing of The Football Association, which could have been a stumbling block because of a change of ownership clause in the contract between the sport’s governing body in England and Umbro.“We are delighted that the proposed acquisition will allow us to continue our strong historical relationship with Umbro while benefiting from the marketing expertise and financial strength of Nike,” said Brian Barwick, FA chief executive.Nike has agreed that Umbro will keep its headquarters in the UK, that the brand will retain the Umbro name and its focus on football above other sports. The deal is Nike’s first acquisition outside north America, and follows the pattern of its previous deals for Converse, Cole-Hahn, Hurley and Bauer brands.“This is an excellent deal for all our stakeholders,” said Steve Makin, Umbro chief executive. “We look forward to taking Umbro to new levels with Nike’s support.”Nike’s offer is the latest move in its stated mission to become the leading global football brand before the 2010 World Cup, trying to fight off tough competition from Adidas, which decided not to bid for Umbro.Earlier this year Nike was involved in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to wrest sponsorship of Germany’s national team from Adidas.In 2006, Umbro made annual revenues of £149.5m . In spite of last week’s defeat to Russia in the Euro 2008 qualifying match and the likelihood that England will not make it through to the final stages of the tournament, the team’s famous white shirt remains the most popular in the world.“The level of this offer is significantly ahead of where we were expecting along with previous multiples seen in the sector and is likely to deter other potential suitors,” said John Cummins, analyst at WH Ireland.He added that the “key unknown” at this stage would be the intention of Sports Direct and JJB Sports, which control 15 per cent and 10 per cent of Umbro respectively.The two sports retailers are expected to want assurances that supplier terms will not deteriorate under Nike control. JJB has stated publicly it wants a “seat at the table” as Umbro’s future is thrashed out.Kate Mcshane, footwear analyst at Citi Investment Research, said she expected Nike to be able to significantly expand Umbro’s sales in Asia, which currently accounts for only around 15 per cent of its sales."
669;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-23T11:18:38Z;Charles Pretzlik: Will Nike live up to its name?;;Nike has, as predicted, bid for Umbro but whether it lives up to its name depends in part on the reactions of Sports Direct and JJB Sports, which control 15 per cent and 10 per cent of Umbro respectively and are run by ex-colleagues. They presumably are worried about protecting the terms of their contract for the England kit. Umbro shares remain below the offer price (although not much) but Mike Ashley looks like quite a smart fund manager, as Nils Pratley pointed out last week in the Guardian.BP has produced some miserable Q3 figures, although not quite as miserable as the market had been expecting after Tony Hayward’s warning of a “dreadful” performance and downgrades from Cazenove, one of the group’s brokers. BP shares are up just over 1 per cent. I just wonder, though, if everyone is not a bit too sanguine about BP’s reserves. There still seem to be some quite bullish forecasts out there, for example from Citigroup.Amazingly, shareholders in Low & Bonar have approved proposals to for a new incentive scheme which would see the chief executive, Paul Forman, receive a one-off bonus worth 7.5 times his salary – and they have done so overwhelmingly. So much for an ABI “red-top”.Things are looking a bit better at Debenhams, where today’s results have lifted the shares 2.5 per cent. If nothing else, it wasn’t a profits warning.Pru shares are up a similar amount on better-than-expected new business figures (which tell us little about profitability), despite a worse-than-expected 20 per cent drop in UK revenues in the nine months to end-September. The growth is all coming from the US and Asia.Things aren’t nearly so good, though, at Autonomy where in-line Q3 figures knocked the stock, which has been on 50 times 2007 earnings, down more than 8 per cent.The FTSE-100 index, by the way, is up 1.5 per cent at lunchtime.Rumours of the day: Word (picked up by the New York Post and FT Alphaville) is that Merrill Lynch is about to announce much worse Q3s than expected. The rumour is that it will take a $12bn charge, not the $5bn one it warned about. Also, a note from Dresdner suggests Ladbroke or William Hill might be interested in Rank. And, rumours again of Adecco looking at Hays.Comment on our coverageAbout this blogReceive this blog for free by emailSee previous blogs
670;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-22T22:00:36Z;Nike expected to launch £280m bid for Umbro;;"Nike, the world’s biggest sportswear company, could this week launch a £280m takeover bid for Umbro, its smaller UK rival.An indicative offer, expected to be pitched at about 190p a share, would signal the start of complicated negotiations involving the Football Association, Sports Direct and JJB Sports.Umbro’s deal to supply a kit to the England football team is the main draw for Nike, which already sponsors the England rugby team and is aiming to become the biggest football kit brand in the world.However, any acquirer would need the support of the FA because of a change of ownership clause in the contract between the sport’s governing body and Umbro.Last week’s purchase of a 10 per cent stake by JJB Sports, following stake-
building by Sports Direct, also puts pressure on Nike to cut a side deal with the UK’s two biggest sports retailers.JJB has stated publicly it wants a “seat at the table” as Umbro’s future is thrashed out. Both JJB and Sports Direct, controlled by its founder Mike Ashley, are large customers of Umbro and are expected to want assurances that supplier terms will not deteriorate if Nike gains control.One person familiar with the situation likened the set-up to this year’s battle over Dobbies Garden Centres where Tesco had to circumnavigate the objections of Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish entrepreneur.He said that, like Sir Tom, Mr Ashley represented a tough and unpredictable character in a delicate bid situation. One factor in Nike’s favour is that Mr Ashley is “in the money” on his stake, having bought at about 120p.Nike’s approach is the latest move in its stated mission to become the leading global football brand before the 2010 World Cup, trying to fight off tough competition from Adidas, which has decided not to bid for Umbro.Adidas saw off a challenge from Nike to take the German football team’s kit sponsorship deal in the summer.Shares in Umbro on Monday fell 8p to 165p."

672;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Nike targets Umbro to help take on Adidas;;English football fans had every right to feel gloomy on Wednesday after England’s hopes of qualifying for the European football Championships were fast fading after a dramatic defeat against Russia.They were not the only crowd feeling blue. Shareholders in Umbro also had reason to feel a little down as the prospect of flogging millions of England shirts in the 2008 European tournament slipped away.It was an event that should have sent Umbro’s share price lower, but news that a Nike was waiting in the wings to buy the replica kit manufacturer sent the shares soaring – in spite of the short-term disappointment of the England loss.Nike’s possible approach to Umbro is the latest salvo in the sportswear chain’s journey to become the leading global football brand by the South African World Cup in 2010.The US sportswear company first crystallised that vision at the beginning of the 1990s when it began investing heavily in football. “Soccer fever”, traditionally the preserve of nations across Europe and Latin America, hit the US with a force when it hosted the World Cup for the first time in 1994. And, while football has never gained the stature of home-grown games in the hearts of Americans, Nike seems determined to become the leading global brand in football. Over the past decade, Nike has been snapping at the heels of Adidas, which had always been the de facto football brand through its strong ties with Fifa. But Nike has been stealing market share.But Adidas enjoyed a much stronger World Cup – held on its home turf of Germany – last year with Nike perceived as having the weakest offering of the big three behind Adidas and Puma. Indeed, with qualification for the European Championships next year close to being decided, it looks as if Adidas and Puma will again outpace Nike in terms of the teams under sponsorship.It has been a bitter pill for Nike, which failed in a hard fought attempt this summer to take the German football team contract out of Adidas’s grasp. James Targett, analyst at Citi, said in a note on Friday that Nike was prepared to pay £300m ($614m) for the German football team contract, in its efforts to end Adidas’s 50-year association with the national team.Having lost out on that deal, Nike now seems to have set its sights on the England contract. The white shirt remains the most popular in the world and Umbro owns the branding rights to attach that logo to the shirt until 2014.Acquiring Umbro would put Nike in pole position to grasp the ultimate prize – global leadership in football shirt manufacturing.One analyst estimated that Adidas’ global market share is 35 per cent, Nike’s 30 per cent and Umbro about 5 per cent. “They would come very close to becoming number one,” admits an Adidas executive.Meanwhile, competitors are piling into the stock, with JJB Sports buying up a 10 per cent stake on Friday. Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct also owns 15 per cent of Umbro. This could muddy the water for Nike – although JJB made it clear on Friday that they thought Nike was a good brand to tie-up with England kit.
673;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;JJB buys 10% stake in Umbro;;JJB Sports paid a hefty premium for a “seat at the table” at Umbro on Friday, joining Sports Direct International as a big shareholder in the British sportswear company ahead of a possible bid from Nike.Roger Lane-Smith, chairman of JJB, said the company decided to snap up a 10 per cent holding as speculation grew that US-based Nike was gearing up to make a takeover approach for the maker of England football shirts.It is thought that an approach could come as early as next week. Umbro and Nike declined to comment.“We wanted a seat at the table,” said Mr Lane-Smith last night. “We are not trying to ruin anything, but Umbro is an important supplier to us.”He also said he was a great fan of the Nike brand. JJB bought 14.8m shares at 178p, a 16 per cent premium to Friday’s opening price of 153p.The price was above last night’s closing price of 173p, after the shares rallied 20p through the day’s trading, giving Umbro a market capitalisation of £253m.They have risen 41 per cent over the past two days. The surprise investment by JJB is likely to raise questions from shareholders, given the level of premium paid.Rival Mike Ashley of Sports Direct has made a paper profit on his 15 per cent holding in Umbro, which he started building a month ago when shares fell to 120p following a profit warning.He is estimated to have spent £26m buying up that stake, which last night was worth £38m, giving the retail billionaire a £12m paper profit.Chris Ronnie, who joined JJB Sports as chief executive earlier this year, is a close associate of Mr Ashley, having worked at Sports Direct as well as working at Umbro for a period as chief operating officer.He joined JJB earlier this year after buying a 29 per cent in JJB with Exista, the Icelandic investment fund, from Dave Whelan, the group’s founder. This was before Mr Ronnie was appointed chief executive.Umbro has the right to attach its logo to the England football shirt until 2014, a lucrative contract in spite of the likelihood that England will fail to qualify for the Euro 2008 tournament following Wednesday’s defeat to Russia.However, the contract with the Football Association is understood to contain a change of control clause that would allow the governing body to switch brands if Umbro was taken over.JJB is believed to have bought its stake from Artemis, the fund management group, through stockbroker Panmure Gordon.
674;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
675;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Nike behind bid for Umbro;;Nike is understood to be behind a takeover approach for Umbro that comes just a day after the England football team it sponsors lost a vital qualifying match for the Euro 2008 championship.Shares in the Cheshire-based sportswear brand, whose most prized asset is the England sponsorship, rose almost 30 per cent after it announced it had received an approach from an unnamed party, valuing the company at £223m ($456m).Two sources familiar with the situation said that the potential bidder was Nike. However, Nike and Umbro declined to comment.Speculation swirled round the London market that Sports Direct, which has built a 15 per cent stake in Umbro, was the would-be acquirer. But neither the increasingly indebted sports retailer nor its maverick founder Mike Ashley are believed to be involved.Adidas, another name in the frame, is also understood to have decided against a bid as it concentrates on improving the operating performance of its main Adidas and Reebok brands.Nike could face antitrust stumbling blocks if it submits a formal bid, given its position as the number one sportswear brand. Nike has successfully built its reputation as a football specialist in recent years while Umbro concentrates almost exclusively on the sport.An acquisiton of Umbro would fit in with Nike’s aim of becoming the leading global football brand by the time of the 2010 World Cup.Nike announced “an aggressive growth strategy” for football last November, having developed its football sales from virtually zero a decade ago to $1.5bn.It is kit sponsor to several leading teams, including Manchester United and FC Barcelona, and has relationshps with individual players such as England’s Wayne Rooney and Brazil’s Ronaldinho.This year it was involved in an ultimately unsuccesful attempt to wrest sponsorship of Germany’s national team from Adidas, its German rival.In spite of Thursday’s defeat to Russia in the Euro 2008 qualifying match and the likelihood that England will not make it through to the tournament proper, the team’s famous white shirt remains the most popular in the world.Umbro has the right to attach its rhombus logo to the England football shirt until 2014. But the contract with the Football Association is understood to contain a change of control clause that would allow the FA to switch to a new brand if Umbro were taken over.Additional reporting by Neil Hume and Richard Milne
676;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-10-18T18:32:52Z;New boss has a chance to take a fresh look at DSG;;If you’re going to blame someone for a profit shortfall then you might as well blame one of the largest companies in the world. Still, it is unworthy of DSG International, the British-based electrical goods retailer, to pin much responsibility for slow demand for laptops running the new Vista operating system on lack of promotion by Microsoft. The US software group presents a big target but when John Browett, DSG’s new chief executive, arrives in December from Tesco, the supermarket chain, he should look closer to home for the root of any enduring problems.John Clare, the outgoing chief executive, alerted markets to the sluggish demand for Vista-based products in August, but that portion of DSG’s trading statement was in part drowned out by applause for his 22 years at the group, in part glossed over by analysts in the expectation that this problem would be dealt with. Instead, it has persisted. The group’s gross margin is still down 0.6 percentage points on the equivalent period of last year and the company now stands to make £50m in pre-tax profit in the first half, rather than the expected £70m. DSG overestimated demand for the PCs by a staggering 50,000 units, according to Kevin O’Byrne, finance director.Mr Browett will arrive on December 5, one week after the interim results announcement. He should be well-positioned to make a fresh start. In so far as retailers influence Christmas trading at all, the factors DSG can control – choice of product, marketing and display – will already be in place. But when Mr Browett presents the trading statement for the holiday period in mid-January, he will be able to kitchen-sink the problems of the past and start to lay out some of his own ideas for the future, drawing on his background as a strategy and operations guru at Tesco and previous head of Tesco.com. There were already a few calls yesterday for a cut in the dividend, which is only covered a scant 1.3 times. That shouldn’t be necessary, but DSG’s operating model needs a long hard look, even if, as the group expects, margins recover. At a lowly 10.5 times forecast earnings for 2008, the shares, following yesterday’s fall, are fairly valued for the uncertainties of Christmas trading, but Mr Browett’s opportunity to instigate change could in due course present an opportunity for investors.Questions of trustFor readers unfamiliar with Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, Lombard is pleased to reveal that a run on the bank lay at the dark heart of the great ITV premium-rate phone scandal. Viewers of what Deloitte’s report into the affair quaintly calls a “variety show” text in answers to a question in order to win a ride on the “Jiggy Bank” – a giant model pig with cash inside. But in 2006, they were cruelly cheated by the production team, which excluded “entrants from places not near a location on the pig’s schedule”.In the absence of a Tripartite Authority to reassure these punters, Michael Grade, ITV’s executive chairman, has stepped in. His apology shows just how much humble pie a man can eat when he runs no risk of being blamed himself. In fact, the offer of £7.8m to reimburse those who spent money on premium phone-calls – part of an £18m operating charge that ITV will take for 2007 – should have little impact on the group. Most analysts and investors have already taken account of the write-off in the company’s beaten-down share price. But there are some broader lessons to be drawn from the scandal. As Mr Grade himself points out, ITV’s failings were due as much to a misplaced surfeit of professionalism as a lack of ethics. Producers were trying to make the best programme, but forgot their responsibility to viewers empowered by their “red button”. ITV’s list of the other factors that conspired to cause the problem – speed of development, technological complexity, overwhelming volume of interest, out-of-date compliance procedures – is a checklist for any company, from retailers to travel agents, that is planning to “cede sovereignty” to newly interactive customers.Such ventures can pay huge dividends in terms of loyalty. Badly handled, however, they can also sacrifice trust, as ITV discovered. That is the sort of loss that no quick profit on call charges can offset.Nike’s two-way betBefore Umbro confirmed it had received a bid approach, shares in the maker of England football kit were languishing under the shadow of the team’s diminished prospects of qualification in next year’s European championship. But it would be rash to speculate that Nike’s interest is a vote of confidence in England’s prospects, still less that the timing reflects a cunning play on the outcome of Wednesday’s qualifier, which saw Russia steal a 2-1 victory over England and Umbro shares dip.As suggested here earlier this week, to place a commercial bet on anything other than an average outcome in international sport is unwise. England kit sales are tied to the on-field performance of the team, but England wear one of the best-selling football shirts in the world. Nike’s offer, if it comes, will be based on an assessment of Umbro’s relationship with all 140 teams it sponsors and a knowledge that there is more to the business of football than the travails of a single team, whatever the fans may think.
677;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-28T23:15:21Z;Sports retailers moving to stop rivals running rings round them;;One week, two very different sets of results in the sports retailing arena. John David Group paraded a 158 per cent leap in profits, while JJB Sports newcomer Chris Ronnie made his results debut with a 38 per cent slump.As Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD, jetted out to Puerto Benus in Spain for a spot of golf to celebrate his fine performance, Mr Ronnie settled down to some hard graft.“I will not be going to as many Christmas dos as I have been going to,” jokes the new chief executive as he reflects on his “things to do list” for the next six months.He will have to rethink the company’s strategy. Until now, JJB has steered a course between the two competing business models of JD, which sells trendy trainers and sports tops to fashion-conscious youngsters, and Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, which is volume-led and heavily discounted. Drifting in that middle ground, JJB has been squeezed.“I think the business has been too aware of what our competitors are doing rather than concentrating on our business,” says Mr Ronnie.“We were too concerned about what product they had and the margins they were getting and we need to be focused on our business.”JJB has been playing catch-up with Sports Direct. It tried to compete on price and its operating margin suffered, dipping to 3.9 per cent in 2006. Sports Direct’s margin was double that amount.It then attempted to trump Mr Ashley by building Adidas and Nike shops within JJB stores, to encourage manufacturers to supply it with more desirable ranges. This went down well with manufacturers, but customers did not like having similar goods dispersed through the store.Those 112 Adidas and 53 Nike sites across 420 stores will be scrapped.At the same time, JJB has failed to tap into own-label brands, an area that seems to be paying off for both JD and Sports Direct.Mr Ashley revolutionised sports retailing by buying brands such as Slazenger and Donnay and selling them in his stores. It gave better margins, exclusive products and more control. It also let him push aggressively on price-cutting to drive sales and footfall.Mr Ronnie is planning to follow the own-brand model. He has signed up Champion and is in talks with others. He wants to increase turnover in this area from 5 per cent of sales to 25 per cent within 18 months.JD, meanwhile, has followed its own path, rather than attempting to mimic Sports Direct. It has spurned the mainstream sports market, turning JD into a leisurewear fashion brand. Even the word ‘Sports’ was dropped from store fronts.“The main reason we are doing well is we are selling more aspirational brands,” says Mr Cowgill from the golf course.“A 40-year-old is quite likely to shop at any of the others, a 19-year-old will come to us. Some of these guys come in and buy eight to ten pairs of trainers.”He stocks Converse, K-Swiss and Lacoste. Own brands include McKenzie, Carbrini and Frisk. Analysts estimate about 12 per cent of group sales are own-label. Mr Cowgill has also started to refurbish the estate and close sites that are not hitting internal returns. The return on capital rose to 17 per cent in 2007, against 5.6 per cent in 2006.Mr Ronnie admits his young daughters – aged 15, 18, and 21 – do not kit themselves out at JJB. “They won’t buy our stuff, they go to Shoe or Office.” Not JD, however.“JJB and Sports Direct are more birds of a feather,” says David Jeary, an Investec analyst and JD’s house broker. “JD is an indirect competitor while the others are more mid-market.”JJB knows it must carve out a niche that is separate from Sports Direct to rebuild profits. Mr Ronnie is starting with softer options – improved customer service, better in-store brands and bigger ranges of equipment such as bikes. He will know after Christmas whether more radical action is needed.
678;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-28T23:06:12Z;JJB drops Nike and Adidas deals;;JJB Sports, which issued a profits warning nearly three weeks ago, is planning to scrap its 165 store-in-store deals with Nike and Adidas and start selling more own-brand sportswear labels in an effort to stem falling profits and sales.Chris Ronnie, the new chief executive, said he wanted JJB to go back to becoming “serious about sport”, arguing that the UK’s second largest sports chain had lost its way. “I think we have been hampered because we don’t know who we want to appeal to,” he said, reflecting on a 38 per cent fall in profits during the first half of its financial year.Mr Ronnie, who has worked under Mike Ashley, the founder of rival Sports Direct, said his first steps would be to improve womenswear lines. He has signed a five-year deal with the Champion label, one of the top five brands in the US, and is in talks to land another three own-label lines. He has also opened a training academy and will be putting in a new staff incentive scheme, which runs down to the shop floor, ahead of Christmas.JJB, which has been squeezed by Sports Direct, also said it was scrapping 112 Adidas and 53 Nike store-in-stores, a move that Roger Lane-Smith, chairman, conceded “might appear to be stupid” given that JJB only began putting the new stores into their chain eight months ago.“It is not about being stupid,” said Mr Ronnie, defending the move. “It is a case of spending too much time worrying about what your competitors are doing. Brands should be brands and retailers should be retailers.”Mr Lane-Smith said while JJB was expecting a fall in profits this year against a £20m profit gain linked to World Cup sales in 2006, the results were “still disappointing”. Sales fell 4.3 per cent to £365m, while operating profits fell 37 per cent to £8.7m, despite an improved gross margin. Pre-tax profit fell from £18.4m to £11.2m.The retail division’s performance, which includes its 420 stores, was “worse than expected”. Revenue from JJB health-club superstores – a market Sports Direct is entering – climbed 21 per cent to £33.1m. The interim dividend is held at 3p.The shares closed up 8½p at 154p.
679;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-24T18:23:53Z;Retailers start selling;;Time to tidy up shop. At the first sign of a hiccup in consumer spending, US retailers have started to dump some of their less desirable assets.Home Depot, which already sold its wholesale supply unit for $8.5bn, will now shutter 11 Landscape Supply stores. Nike plans to sell its Nike Bauer Hockey division and review businesses in its “other” category.Nike and Home Depot are making targeted moves. But retailers with less privileged positions in their sectors are chopping off dead weight in an effort to stay competitive. Home goods retailer Pier 1 Imports, a longstanding lossmaker, is dissolving its internet and catalogue sales operations and closing children’s and clearance stores. Circuit City is struggling through a turnround that, among other things, will replace 3,400 of its employees with cheaper, less experienced workers. The companies concerned have consistently cited a renewed focus on profits or “core businesses”. Investor reactions have been less uniform. Nike’s shares rose, thanks to its robust profits and overseas revenue growth. But the already sagging shares of Pier 1 and Home Depot sank further on news of their plans, and Circuit City’s stock plunged 18 per cent in one day.Ahead of a possible retail slowdown, investors are favouring companies that are proactively pursuing strategic goals over those that are struggling to catch up. Nike is selling the hockey business, in spite of its strong results, because it does not fit with the company’s growth plans. In contrast, Circuit City, to stave off rival Best Buy, is attempting a protracted and defensive transformation that has disrupted business, hurt sales and shrunk margins.Even in the good times, there’s a difficult balance between staying lean and exploring new avenues for growth. Now that the slower economy is unmasking failed strategies, expect more retailers to pare down to the bare necessities.
680;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-21T21:22:33Z;Wall St enjoys best week in six months;;"Wall Street stocks had their best week for six months after the Federal Reserve surprised markets by slashing interest rates by half a percentage point.The S&P 500 on Tuesday enjoyed its biggest one-day gain since March 2003 as investors bet that low interest rates would lend support to the US economy.The decision to cut both the Fed Funds rate and the discount rate – the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed – appeared to calm equity markets as share volatility eased.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, a measure of future market volatility, fell 24 per cent to lows last reached at the end of July before the credit squeeze.Trading volumes were high on the week and on Friday the New York Stock Exchange set a new volume record for the first hour of trading.Equity markets surged even as the dollar fell to a new record low against the euro.The CurrencyShares Euro Trust exchange traded fund, which tracks the price of the euro, closed the week at an all-time high.The S&P 500 was 2.8 per cent higher on the week at 1,525.72, within 1.8 per cent of its all-time high, set in July. The Dow Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.8 per cent at 13,820.19 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.7 per cent at 2,671.22.Large-cap companies saw particularly strong gains. The Russell Top 50 index of the largest US companies by market capitalisation hit its highest level since 2001.“I’m surprised at the strong snap back – it’s almost like we discounted everything that happened over the last three months,” Joe Ranieri, managing director of trading of Canaccord Adams, said. “The weaker dollar is going to be good for earnings at the larger cap companies, particularly in the tech sector.”The Nasdaq was lifted on Friday by some positive earnings news from Oracle and details of a share buyback by Texas Instruments.Google set a new all-time high, up 5.9 per cent for the week at $560.10.However, it was a disappointing week for Microsoft, down 1.3 per cent to $28.65, after a European court upheld a European Commission ruling that the software group had abused its near-monopoly position.Oracle reported a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The stock was up 9.5 per cent on the week at $21.98.Texas Instruments was 5.6 per cent higher at $36.62 after its board approved a $5bn share buyback programme and announced plans to raise its cash dividend by 25 per cent.In other earnings news, Nike said quarterly profit rose 51 per cent. Shares in the athletic shoe and clothing company were flat for the week at $57.26.The week’s earnings news was dominated by the brokerage sector as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns turned in their third-quarter report cards.Goldman and Lehman surprised the market with better-than-expected earnings, up 10.2 per cent to $209.98 and 5.4 per cent to $62.70 on the week, respectively.But Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley disappointed.Shares in Morgan, which reported a 17 per cent third-quarter profit decline, were down 2.5 per cent on the week at $64.44.

681;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-21T17:29:05Z;Tarnished history of greatest prize in sport;;When O.J. Simpson is accused of the armed robbery of signed footballs and baseballs, you know one thing for sure: the market in sports memorabilia has overheated.The notorious former American footballer says he was in the Las Vegas hotel room last week only to reclaim items that were his. But if Simpson was convicted, he would be part of a great tradition. Bits of sports memorabilia have been stolen for over a century. Twice, the biggest prize of all was stolen: the Jules Rimet (pictured), the original trophy of soccer’s World Cup. I believe the Jules Rimet, the Maltese Falcon of sport, was not melted down as commonly believed but is still around, probably in some back-room in Brazil.The Victorians invented everything, including theft of sports memorabilia. On September 11 1895, the FA Cup disappeared from a football outfitter’s shop window in Birmingham. Only in 1958 did Harry Burge, a homeless octogenarian living in a Birmingham hostel, tell a newspaper he had taken the “Little Tin Idol” and melted it down to make fake half-crown coins. As a measure of the trophy’s hypothetical value today, its successor was auctioned two years ago for £488,000.When Jules Rimet created the football World Cup in 1930, the Parisian sculptor Abel Lafleur produced the trophy itself: a 35cm-high Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. The potential for theft was obvious. Nike spent the second world war hiding under the bed of an Italian football official. But one Sunday in 1966, she was stolen from a stamp exhibition in London. The Brazilian football association, the CBD, which had just handed over the trophy its team had held since 1958, was livid. “It would never have happened in Brazil,” said the CBD’s Alain Tebel. “Even Brazilian thieves love football and would never commit this sacrilege.”The Wednesday after the theft, England’s football association received a parcel containing the top of the missing cup and a ransom note. It said: “No doubt you view with very much concern the loss of the World Cup. To me it is only so much scrap gold. If I don’t hear from you by Thursday or Friday at the latest, I assume its one for the POT.”The sender of the note was Edward Betchley, a former soldier who had been demobbed after the war with an “exemplary character”. Betchley was jailed for two years. In 1969, he died of emphysema, the first victim of the curse on the cup’s thieves.The stolen trophy was soon found by a dog named Pickles under some bushes in south London. After the World Cup final of 1966, it was presented to the winning English team. “It’s only 12in high, solid gold, and it means that England are the world champions!” BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme famously exulted.In 1970, Brazil won their third World Cup and were given the Jules Rimet forever. But, in 1983, the trophy was stolen from a glass case in the CBD’s offices in Rio de Janeiro and was never seen again. Four thieves were caught and sentenced. Three are now dead. One, a former policeman named Chico Barbudo, was gunned down in a bar while out on appeal. Rio’s police say the trophy was melted down into bars. That claim allowed them to abandon their hunt. But it was probably false.The trophy wasn’t turned into gold bars because it wasn’t solid gold to begin with. “It’s just gold over silver,” says Martin Atherton, whose book The Theft of the Jules Rimet Trophy is out next month. The Brazilian thieves may have thought, along with Wolstenholme and almost everyone else, that it was gold. But after discovering it wasn’t, and that its metal value in 1983 was a modest $13,000, they quite probably decided they could get more selling it to an aficionado, even if he could never display it publicly. This often happens with stolen paintings.The sole survivor of the gang of 1983 is the Argentine jeweller Juan Carlos Hernández. The year after the theft, he founded a company called Aurimet, a name that appears to conflate “Au” – the chemical symbol for gold – with Rimet. Eventually Hernández was sentenced to three years in jail but he was only captured in 1998 at a Brazilian airport, carrying 7.75kg of cocaine. He was released from jail in 2005.Investigators said Hernández had melted down the trophy at his foundry in Rio. He denies it was melted down. A chemical analysis of his foundry found traces of gold of a different quality from the trophy. And his methods allowed him to melt only 250g of gold at a time, whereas the trophy weighed 1.8kg. Atherton says: “They never pinned it down, that it had been melted. But they never got it back.”It’s the greatest prize in sport. At a Fifa workshop in Munich in 2004, an official of the global football authority said: “The Jules Rimet trophy was the people’s trophy. People knew something about this trophy: it was stolen, or got lost.” The current World Cup, he admitted, arouses less emotion.It is quite likely that the Jules Rimet is still out there, probably in some wealthy crook’s house, outshining all the glitter that O.J. was chasing.simonkuper-ft@hotmail.com
682;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-19T20:58:19Z;China clothing IPO sets sights on $700m;;China Dongxiang, the sports apparel group, is expected to raise about $700m in an initial public offering in Hong Kong next month, people close to the listing said on Wednesday.The company, which owns rights to Italian sportswear brand Kappa in mainland China and Macao, is seeking to capitalise on the rapid growth of China’s consumer market and increased domestic interest in sportswear ahead of next year’s Olympics in Beijing.Chen Yihong, chairman, who declined to comment on the listing, told the Financial Times that China Dongxiang had repositioned the Kappa brand to avoid direct competition with sportswear groups such as Nike and Adidas.Mr Chen was one of the co-founders of Chinese sportswear company Li Ning in 1991 and a member of the 2001 Chinese delegation that won the bid to host the Olympics.“We foresaw then that China’s sportswear market would grow explosively, but also that international brands would start to move quickly and aggressively into China,” he said.China Dongxiang was founded in 2002 as a Li Ning subsidiary to operate franchises for international brands – such as Kappa – seeking to enter China.By last year, China Dongxiang and Li Ning had parted ways, and the company ran more than 1400 Kappa outlets. It had also bought out the ownership rights for the brand in mainland China, helped by Morgan Stanley acquiring a 20 per cent stake in the company for $38m.It had repositioned Kappa in China as a cross between a sportswear and a fashion company, said Mr Chen, to avoid directly competing against Nike and Adidas, the top two selling brands in China.This included sponsoring a celebrity football team – not something Kappa would have done traditionally, he said. “It was a pioneering move for the brand.”China Life Insurance group, hedge fund Tiger Global and Hong Kong-listed Intime Department Store are cornerstone investors in China Dongxiang’s listing, which is underwritten by Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank.
683;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-09-17T16:38:02Z;The products that never say die;;"When wearers of Nike’s Considered Boot decide their footwear has come to the end of its life, the world’s largest sportswear company offers them an alternative to the refuse truck: recycling.A single piece of hemp is woven through the boot’s leather parts. Snaps, not adhesives, bind the upper body to its sole, which is made from factory rubber waste. And the design is simple, requiring fewer production steps but also less effort when picking it apart.The designers behind the Considered Boot – part of a line of sustainable products developed by Nike – paid attention not only to the manufacturing processes and performance of the boot, but also to the ease with which it could be recycled at the end of its life.A growing number of manufacturers are doing the same. Legislation is one incentive: Europe’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive requires manufacturers and importers of electronic goods to collect and recycle their goods. But smart companies also recognise that cost savings lie in being able to reuse materials and parts of their products.This “cradle-to-cradle” approach – a philosophy espoused by US architect William McDonough and his consultancy, MBDC – is how Steelcase, the US office furniture maker, approaches the design of its chairs, desks and cabinets.Steelcase, which has worked with MBDC, does not blend any materials in the production of its furniture, since this prevents them from being recycled. Instead it has sought solutions further down the supply chain, working with companies such as BASF, the German chemicals group, which is developing new forms of plastic.Using fewer materials is another key factor to consider when facilitating recycling. In one celebrated example, VauDe, the German outdoor wear manufacturer, came up with a range of jackets in which every element – from the fabric to zippers, fasteners, thread and cords – was made of polyester.However, design for recycling involves consideration of more than materials. “Often things are designed with assembly in mind and disassembly isn’t considered,” says Stuart Ballinger, strategies manager at Envirowise, a UK government-backed consultancy. “So rather than having lots of screws holding the product together, use snap fixings that are moulded into the plastic, which also means you’re using one material, rather than having a screw and a separate moulded piece.”Speed is also critical. Allan Smith, head of environmental strategy at Steelcase, says the goal for the company’s products is that pulling them apart should take no more than five minutes using traditional hand tools.To that end, Steelcase watched workers in facilities around Michigan taking its products apart. “We found that the longer it took and the more frustrating it was, the less likely they were to get it into a recycling stream,” he says. “If it was more than five minutes it wouldn’t get recycled.”Moreover, if what can be pulled out of a product is worthless, there is little incentive to recycle it. The carpet industry is a case in point, says Gregory Unruh, director of the Lincoln Centre for Ethics in Global Management at Thunderbird School of Global Management. In the 1990s, as part an eco-
efficiency drive to prevent nylon going to landfill, the industry cut the amount of nylon in its flooring.However, when nylon recycling technologies emerged, so little nylon was left in the carpets that they were not worth recycling. Prof Unruh likens it to mining. “If you’re going to mine a deposit of gold, you want a rich deposit because it costs a lot to dig it up,” he says.Recycling also presents some tricky trade-offs. While organic cotton is environmentally friendly, clothes made of nylon 6, an artificial polymer, are endlessly recyclable with no loss of performance.For companies that use bleached board, a common constituent of packaging, there is a ready recycling market at the paper mill. More is paid for bleached than for unbleached board, which cannot be used in higher-value products such as paper tissues. Yet the elemental chlorine used to whiten paper and board is a toxic gas.Often it is lack of systems that hampers recycling, particularly at the consumer end of the chain. “The challenge is to get the product back to you,” says Lorrie Vogel, general manager of Nike’s Considered team. “We could spend a lot of time designing for disassembly and taking it back, but the truth is we do not get back much product.”Nike has a take-back scheme run through its Niketown store, through which more than 18m shoes have now been recycled to create more than 200 sports courts. “But if you talk about 18m shoes, that’s a very low percentage overall compared with the amount of product we create,” says Ms Vogel.As a result, Nike focuses more attention on getting its suppliers to recycle. “When we have waste in manufacturing, we ask them to take that waste and put it back into the materials that go into our products,” says Ms Vogel.Ms Vogel’s comment illustrates the importance of collaboration and partnerships. But this sometimes means narrowing the supply chain, since suppliers able to comply with recycling requirements may be thinner on the ground.“You lose some degree of flexibility,” says Mr Smith. “But we think there are also benefits of working with a preferred network. When you concentrate your purchasing, you tend to be more important to that supplier and so in some cases we’ve found an increase in levels of service, quality and innovation.”Another solution is vertical integration – the idea of a closed-loop system whereby the company manufacturing the products is also recycling them.It was for this reason that Shaw Industries Group, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, last year purchased Evergreen, a recycling plant in Dalton, Georgia, that was shut down in 2001 by Honeywell and DSM, the chemicals company. This year, Shaw will recycle 100m pounds of post-consumer nylon 6 carpet at the facility.Steve Bradfield points to the benefits of vertical integration when trying to achieve closed-loop recycling. “You can certainly do it with partnership of suppliers, but it’s more difficult because those suppliers have to adopt the same mindset,” he says.While companies grapple with the design and operational adjustments needed for recycling, they must not neglect quality.“One of the things you have to keep in mind is the customer,” says Mr Bradfield. “The customer wants a product that will do the same job, for the same or lower price and they won’t sacrifice any performance attributes. In fact, they like us to improve the performance. So in all cases, you cannot go backwards with the customer.”Four steps to aid recyclingKeep it simple. The more complex a product is – in design and the number of materials used – the longer it takes to disassemble. Time is a big deterrent when managers decide whether to recycle.Avoid blending. Fused materials cannot be recycled. This may mean exploring new types of materials that have the same performance qualities as the blended versions.Snap to it. As well as making disassembly faster and easier, snaps and other quick-release connections that are moulded into the main structure remove another material – the plastic or metal screw – from the product.Work with partners. Since post-consumer recycling remains hampered by lack of a collection infrastructure, getting suppliers to reuse waste is often where the greatest gains are to be found."
684;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-08-03T19:00:14Z;BA shares stabilising – but at a low altitude;;The headlines say British Airways is having a terrible year. The numbers tell a different story.The airline’s first-quarter results were surprisingly good. Its operating margin was 12 per cent, a quarterly record. The weak dollar hit revenues but this was offset by the currency’s counterbalancing impact on costs. Willie Walsh, BA’s chief executive, is confident that the company will achieve a 10 per cent operating margin in the full year. That too would be a record.The results were all the more impressive given the continuing security restrictions on hand luggage and the chaos at Heathrow, BA’s main hub, which are damping passenger demand.BA’s performance is benefiting from tough action taken by Mr Walsh last year. He cut jobs, made a payment into the pension scheme to reduce its deficit and scaled down future benefits for scheme members.With BA’s shares down 25 per cent this year, it is tempting to hope that Friday will prove to be a turning point for the stock. The shares spent most of the trading day up – until the close – after rising 5 per cent on Thursday.Some clouds have lifted from BA, not least with this week’s resolution of the UK and US probes into price fixing. The opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 next March provides another potential boost. BA has also agreed a pay settlement that should keep the unions quiet for 18 months.But the risks of disappointment still seem too high to support a sustained recovery in BA’s shares. With Heathrow running at full capacity, its ability to withstand shocks – from bad weather to security alerts – is limited. Thirteen of BA’s long-haul planes were struck by lightning on the ground at Heathrow in one day last month, necessitating checks. This is a company that needs all the luck it can get.Moreover, competition is intensifying for revenue from premium passengers – the strongest feature of yesterday’s results. From March, US carriers such as Delta Air Lines and Continental will be able to fly out of Heathrow courtesy of the Open Skies accord.Such risks and threats are hard to price. But they justify a discount rating on BA shares. For now, it is safer to assume the stock has only stabilised at this altitude.Analysts and accessFred Bjelland, Morgan Stanley’s retail analyst, is struggling to get access to the management team at Sports Direct. So he has taken the unusual step of suspending his valuation on the retailer until he can run his assumptions past the company. But it is not always a bad thing if analysts have no hotline to company management.Take Mr Bjelland’s research. He may not have had a one-on-one with Mike Ashley, Sports Direct’s founder, but he has found out an awful lot about the company by visiting its stores.A trip to a shop in south-east London led to a conversation with staff on the subject of the company’s relationship with Nike, one of its most important suppliers. Nike is renowned for preciously guarding its premium-brand status, something that sits ill with Sports Direct’s traditional “pile it high, sell it cheap” strategy.“We are trying to be a proper sports shop now, not a junk sale,” said the staff member quoted in Mr Bjelland’s research. “Nike told us that if we didn’t sort our stores out, it would stop supplying us.”That kind of nugget – if true – could be just as valuable as anything Mr Bjelland might have gleaned from a meeting with Mr Ashley. After all, stock market regulations forbid company executives from selectively providing price-sensitive information to analysts.This is not to say that analysts should never try to meet management. A face-to-face chat with the chief executive offers the chance to grill him about wider strategic issues and industry trends.But it is a dangerous – and commonly held – notion that analysts with greater access to management somehow produce more informed research. That is why the Takeover Panel strictly polices the output of the house broker to any company that is in a bid situation. The Panel recognises that investors tend to think such research has an edge. The risk is that the research is biased.Analysts used to rely heavily on spoon-feeding by companies to get their numbers right. It is a good thing that regulatory changes have made this harder. Thankfully, Mr Bjelland has shown that it is still possible to produce useful research without a hotline to company directors.Trade buyers fight backFresh evidence that the credit-market turmoil is making companies more confident about winning takeover battles against private equity firms.Tomkins, the engineering group, is talking about using surplus cash to make acquisitions. Previously, buy-out firms might have bid up the price of targets beyond Tomkins’ reach. But those firms would now struggle to obtain financing for their offers.The company produced good results on Friday, but it is still one of the stock market’s underdogs. Its business depends on the difficult US housing and automotive markets. If Tomkins is feeling bullish about deals, imagine the confidence of companies that have less on their plate.
685;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-07-18T15:40:59Z;When rainclouds promise a silver lining;;"When the world of golf turns its gaze on Carnoustie today for the start of the 136th Open Championship, the vast majority of people will be hoping for sunshine. But there is a small segment of golf’s $100bn global industry for whom a continuation of this wretchedly wet British summer would be a blessing.Manufacturers of golf-related waterproof and windproof clothing – “weatherwear” – would be handed a commercial birdie if Tiger Woods and his chums were beamed into living rooms around the world in the next few days in wet-weather gear.ProQuip, official supplier to the European tour, is one of a few UK companies that jostle with international clothing giants such as Nike and Adidas in what is estimated to be a £200m global market for golf weatherwear. The UK, probably the most mature market for these goods, is thought to account for about £30m of this.The company aims to keep ahead through staying nimble in meeting – and often anticipating – consumer demand, by prioritising customer service and by innovating.In a quest for breathability, it was the first to use Gore-Tex in golf clothing, according to Richard Head, managing director, and its latest noise-reducing suits draw on his experiences of working with the military on fabrics.“When I entered the industry in 1989, the waterproof material was not really breathable,” he says.Since then, innovations have included Ultralite, a lightweight waterproof developed in the late 1990s, and Silk Touch, using a fabric produced for the victorious European team in last year’s Ryder Cup in Ireland. One of the main aims – after consultation with team captain Ian Woosnam – was to reduce distracting noise. The company has just launched a new waterproof suit for women, Liberty, which Mr Head says is extremely light, soft and quiet but affordable because everything was sourced directly.Mr Head, a clothing specialist whose 32 years in the industry have seen him “do everything from Beefeater uniforms for the Tower of London to chemical warfare suits”, drew on such experiences to develop Silk Touch. “When you are making anything for the special services, noise and compactability are very important. I thought of it as a garment for which you almost needed stealth technology.”The Ryder Cup last year helped make 2006 a banner year for the company. ProQuip weatherwear was bought for 4,000 staff and corporate customers before the event, which turned out to be very rainy, and a further 3,000 garments were bought by the public at the competition. Former US presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton were at one point sporting ProQuip gear. “You couldn’t pay for that sort of publicity,” says Mr Head.Nevertheless, in such a competitive market, Mr Head estimates that even in a good year, such as 2006, ProQuip’s profits will have reached only about £100,000 on turnover of about £3m. In addition, high oil prices have had a big impact on ProQuip’s cost base because many technical qualities of the clothing are achieved with carefully formulated chemical mixes.The size of investment needed to make the kind of innovations behind an Ultralite or a Silk Touch means they represent a big gamble for a company of ProQuip’s size. Mr Head, one of just three ProQuip shareholders, puts the cost of bringing Ultralite to market at £250,000-£500,000, while Silk Touch cost even more. “If Ultralite had gone wrong, we might have lost a third of our market,” he says.With prices of high-performance waterproof suits reaching
towards £400 – Silk Touch is pitched at £239 – they represent a significant outlay even for serious golfers. Mr Head has accordingly focused on designing items that can be worn off the golf course as well as on it. “In my time here, we have made maybe 4m garments and I have seen more at Heathrow airport than on golf courses,” he says.What about diversifying into other sports? “Many of the US tour golfers are fanatical fishermen,” he says. “We have looked at that area. It is one we could move into more easily than we might think.”"
686;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-06-27T21:22:11Z;Wall St rebounds sharply as volatility slumps;;US equity benchmarks rebounded sharply on Wednesday, with strength in technology and energy stocks a boost for sentiment as the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting on interest rates got underway.Stocks shrugged aside a drop in May durable goods orders and worries over the subprime mortgage market that was accompanied by a surge in volatility during early trade.The S&P 500 index rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,506.35, and reversed after touching a low of 1,484.18. Leading sectors included, energy stocks, boosted by a renewed rise in oil prices, technology and utilities.Financials reversed early losses and shares in Bear Stearns rose 2.8 per cent to $143.31. The bank has been the focus of worries that troubles in the subprime mortgage market could hurt Wall Street.Late on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had initiated a broad-based investigation into the troubled subprime mortgage market.“We have seen a lot of volatility in the market, exacerbated by the subprime fallout,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity options trader at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The market seems to believe it is contained and not a major problem.”Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index experienced a wild ride. After a rise towards 19 early in the day, a level not seen since the start of March, Vix subsequently tumbled 17.9 per cent to 15.51 late on Wednesday.As stocks recovered ground during the day, home builders and real estate stocks also rallied after experiencing compelling weakness in recent days.Technology stocks led broad market gains and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 2,605.35, boosted in part by Oracle’s better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.2 per cent.Blue chips, lagged overall gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.7 per cent at 13,427.73.Downbeat economic news was a source of worry for stock investors early on Wednesday. Durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in May, greater than the expected 0.8 per cent decline and non-defence capital goods also slid sharply.Meanwhile orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, fell 3.0 per cent, reversing the 2.3 per cent rise in April. Year-on-year, orders for what is a barometer of business spending were lower by 1.4 per cent.The data pulled bond yields lower, and boosted the expectation of rate cuts later this year and for 2008. Worries still prevail that the weak housing market will hurt the overall economy.“Housing is a long, slow sore that will not heal anytime soon,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “The issue is what will be the spillover effects for consumption and it’s too early to say at this point.” For now, stocks are stuck in a range, said Mr Strazzullo.Anxiety among investors was also heightened after US Foodservice said it would postpone the financing of its $7.1bn buy-out by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts due to weak market conditions.Underwriters pulled a $1.5bn bond offering that was to be used to finance the purchase of the company from Royal Ahold by the two private equity firms – suggesting that ongoing trouble in the debt markets could damp the recent rush of buy-out deals.In spite of that concern two deals were announced on Wednesday.Guitar Center said its board accepted a $1.9bn cash buy-out offer from a private equity firm. Shares in the music retailer soared 19.8 per cent to $59.98.Meanwhile, People’s United Financial, the banking firm, agreed to buy the New England-based Chittenden Corporation for $1.9 bn in cash and stock. Chittenden shares rose 24.5 per cent to $35.15, while People’s United Financial fell 2.9 per cent to $18.17.Among stocks in the news on Wednesday, ConAgra Foods rose 4.5 per cent to $26.70 after a surge in its fiscal fourth quarter profit.Nike jumped 8.3 per cent to $58.29, after its said growth in the US and abroad had pushed profits up 32 cent in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period.Oracle reported a jump in quarterly profit late on Tuesday. The results beat the consensus forecast of analysts, and the company also issued a bullish outlook for the current quarter. Oracle shares rose 2.8 per cent to $19.69.Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp said that he expects his group’s acquisition of Dow Jones, whose shares fell 0.4 per cent at $58.56, will take place within the next two to three weeks or not at all. Mr Murdoch also said he did not intend to increase his bid of $5bn.Shares in Blackstone continued to slide, after the private equity firm listed at $31 a-share last Friday. The stock fell 2.7 per cent to $29.92, and is down 14.7 per cent so far this week.
687;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;VF’s ‘science’ project is paying off;;"Mackey McDonald, chief executive of VF Corporation, is happy to admit that recent improvements at the largest US clothing company come from copying other people’s ideas.In late 2003, his company embarked upon a strategic review that led him to sit down with AG Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, and other leading consumer products companies in the search for ways to develop a set of clothing brands that include Lee and Wrangler jeans, The North Face and Nautica.“We learned some very interesting things …and we’re learning how to apply them to the apparel industry,” says Mr McDonald.The changes at VF have included dividing the company’s 37 brands into “lifestyle groups” – jeanswear, sportwear, outdoor and imagewear.To support the groups, VF also set up a business strategy group for research and development – what he calls the “science” of clothing retailing.“We’ve transformed from category brands more to lifestyle brands that are more connected to consumers and what they do within their lifestyles,” Mr McDonald says.The changes prefigured similar moves by Nike, the sportswear company, which announced the creation of a “lifestyle” focused organisation last year.And in late June, Liz Claiborne, VF’s smaller US rival, announced a similar “brand focused” reorganisation, with plans to set up its own research and development department.As evidence that the science can work in what he calls a “consistently inconsistent industry” Mr McDonald cites the improvement in the performance of VF’s Lee brand, which recently won a vendor of the year award from JC Penney, following intensive studies of what its mid-tier female customers wanted.VF found, he says, that “we were really missing the centre of the target by either being too basic or too fashion forward …the customer wanted innovation, but not extreme.”Selling clothing, he argues, is still subordinate to the art of reading fashion trends. “The product changes so rapidly and so frequently, it’s different from selling beer or ketchup …but today we’re using better scientific techniques to really get into the heads of our customers.”The changes have helped VF Corp, with sales of more than $6.5bn last year, weather the upheavals in the wholesale business created by Macy’s 2005 takeover of its largest rival, and to hold its own against the increasing enthusiasm for private-label brands at department stores such as Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohls.Liz Claiborne, on the other hand, has struggled. The retailer, which has sales last year of $5bn, blamed a poor first quarter on the upheaval in its wholesale business.Its new chief executive, William McComb, has now announced a restructuring “to put ‘brand’ at the centre of all we do”.All aspects of brands such as Mexx, Kate Spade and Juicy Couture will be run vertically in a new “direct brands” division. It is also setting up its first “global strategy, planning and research” unit, to handle consumer research.Previously elements of its top brands could be split horizontally across three separate company divisions: direct retail, wholesale clothes and wholesale accessories – both serving department store customers such as Macy’s and JC Penney.Mr McComb’s approach to the company’s brands aproach is also based in the consumer products world; he spent 14 years at Johnson & Johnson, where he managed businesses and brands, including painkiller, Tylenol.Behind the changes lies the theory that using research to ensure customer relevence will ensure that his leading national brands can hold their own in the battle for space in the department stores – in the same way that Tylenol still sits alongside cheaper generic product on American drugstore shelves.“Consumers that go into stores will expect to see national brands as well as the retailers’ brands,” says VF’s Mr McDonald. “And our role is to bring innovative new products that are right for the shoppers in those stores.”"
688;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-06-25T22:10:16Z;Adidas puts faith in Beckham to deliver;;Adidas will on Tuesday launch one of its biggest US advertising campaigns yet, using David Beckham’s imminent arrival as a Los Angeles Galaxy player to boost its US football business.Beckham has endorsed the German sportswear group’s products for 12 years, helping it sell sports apparel all over the world.However, his summer transfer from Real Madrid to the Los Angeles Galaxy has given Adidas an opportunity to tap into the world’s fastest growing football market.“The US market has a real opportunity to grow,” said Stephen Pierpoint, vice-president of brand marketing for Adidas. “There are 17.6m participant players and 70 per cent of them are under 18. Meanwhile, 40 per cent of 12-17 year olds have played organised soccer.”It is hoped that Beckham’s stardom and global appeal will increase football’s standing in the US, attract new fans and encourage people to play the game.Adidas is locked in a two-way fight with Nike for supremacy in the global sporting goods industry. But the US company, by some distance the world’s largest, has stolen a march on Adidas by coming from nowhere to challenge for market leadership in football within a decade while the German group has struggled to make headway in Nike’s North American stronghold.Adidas bought US rival Reebok two years ago for $3.8bn but has so far failed to see much impact in the key market of the US where the group now sponsors the leagues of all the major sports from baseball to American Football.“Football has always been a core sport for Adidas,” said Mr Pierpoint. “We hope David will be the catalyst for growth [in the US].”Mr Beckham has agreed a five-year deal that could be worth as much as $250m, provided he is a success on and off the pitch and helps the Galaxy sell more replica shirts and merchandise.The new Adidas campaign features Beckham playing alongside one of the best-known US sports stars, Reggie Bush, an American football player with the New Orleans Saints.“They are the two most talked-about athletes in the US,” said Mr Pierpoint. “David’s name transcends his own sport.”Although Beckham has yet to kick a ball for the Galaxy he and his wife Victoria have already become fixtures on the US celebrity circuit. They have attracted considerable attention from tabloid television programmes and magazines.Billboards featuring Beckham have also started to appear in Los Angeles, with Walt Disney using the football star alongside Hollywood actors, such as Scarlett Johansson. However, the new Adidas campaign will be the first of its kind to feature the star on prime-time television.
689;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Cannes Diary: Six of the best;;The decision by Mainardo de Nardis, chief executive of the media buying businesses of Aegis, the UK-listed group, to hire a scooter for the Cannes Lions initially looked like the over-optimism typical of advertising executives.For this year’s Lions, a week-long mix of daytime seminars and nightly creative awards for the global advertising sector, opened in rain and gusty wind.And festival scooter riders normally have their work cut out simply avoiding tired and emotional industry luminaries spilling out of the notorious “Gutter Bar” on La Croisette, the main drag in Cannes, at all hours of the day and night.The volatile weather, however, provided an irresistably hammy metaphor for the run-up to the Lions when more than $10bn was invested in companies which mix advertising and technology services.The implications of deals by Google, Microsoft, WPP and Publicis for an industry which handles more than $400bn a year of expenditure on worldwide paid-for advertising are still uncertain.It was little surprise that Zenith Optimedia, the international media buying network owned by Paris-based Publicis, called its Monday morning seminar on future trends for the media sector “The Perfect Storm”.Zenith argued that despite expectations that worldwide media advertising would grow by a nominal 5-6 per cent average this year, in line with historical trends, the sector faced its biggest period of change this decade.It said this was due to the impact of a combination of technology developments, shifting consumer habits and geographical factors.The argument offered a new-ish spin on a familiar theme: conventional ways of marketing were becoming less effective at reaching people, particularly in mature western markets.By the end of the week, however, the sun had returned to the Riviera and qualified optimism was the more characteristic tone of major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Nike and American Express.Jim Stengel, chief marketing officer of P&G, told the FT: “I think the industry is out of its dark ages and into a renaissance.”An upbeat tone was also displayed by agency networks such as Euro RSCG, part of Havas, the French marketing group controlled by Vincent Bolloré, himself bullish about long-term prospects for media industry growth.So for those trying to remember what they did at Cannes, and as well as those eager to forget, here is the FT’s summary of six main themes at the 54th Lions International Advertising Festival.1. An industry charging for freeThe balance is changing between brands’ attempts to attract customers via paid-for media advertising and their efforts to get people to pass on positive views about products on and off the web, essentially for free.Free distribution of advertising cannot replace paid-for slots altogether, but it does require development of new ways to track, evaluate and account for marketing value.The internet campaign for Unilever’s Dove, the skincare brand, which took the festival’s prestigious film Grand Prix, was only the most high profile example of this theme.The Dove film benefited from a large element of free distribution after consumers shared it via websites such as YouTube and blogs.However, getting customers to endorse brands to their peers – so-called word of mouth marketing – has become an over-riding general industry preoccupation.Nike, the sports brand, for instance, won a Lion for Nike +, a joint venture with Apple’s iPod business which enables joggers to log runs and connect to other users using their iPods, a community website and specially adapted trainers.Stefan Olander, Nike’s global director of digital and content, said: “97 per cent of Nike+ users said they would recommend the service to a friend. That figure is unheard of.”2. Do you have it in green?Mr Stengel at P&G, which has been overhauling the sizing and packaging of its detergent brands in the US to reflect consumer’s interest in environmental benefits, says crisply: “We’re seeing it pretty much as a global trend. I don’t think it’s a fad, not at all.”But advertisers are split over whether the trend is something they should incorporate into their consumer-facing marketing, or should be treated as part of internal corporate social responsibility.3. There today, here tomorrow.China, South Korea and India are providing laboratories for advertisers to develop content and campaigns - particularly in mobile, outdoor and broadband internet formats - which are destined to be exported into western markets.4. Brands of brothers.The large subscriber bases, often skewed towards the young shoppers prized by advertisers, of social websites such as FaceBook and MySpace make them theoretically valuable platforms for advertisers.But audiences are typically spread thinly over many parts of such websites and can be averse to direct marketing approaches. Attempts to transplant existing campaigns into such contexts have often flopped.To some industry experts, these sites may be more valuable as pools for market research and public relations rather than outlets for conventional brand marketing.Overall, FaceBook and Joost, the fledgling ad-funded free internet television service which avoids showing copyright infringing material, appear more in favour among advertisers than YouTube or MySpace.Simon Rothon, senior vice-president, marketing services global at Unilever, told the FT: “On sites such as FaceBook, people are effectively having private conversations. As a marketer, you don’t want to intrude on a private conversation. The trick will be try to join the conversation by offering something relevant.”5. More capital, please.Steve King, chief executive of Zenith Optimedia, the media buyer, said: “Our business used to driven by cash-generation, based on buying large volumes of media at a small gross margin.“But the scale of engagement we’re having with clients is changing. The need for capital to invest in new systems and the cost of collecting and analysing research is going up, and that is changing the way we do business.”Yusuf Mehdi, chief advertising strategist of Microsoft, which had a large presence at the Lions, told the FT: “I do think this [online advertising] is a business where the scale of investment to provide a platform which will run across all types of digital media and all types of analytics is only going to be able to be done by a few large providers.“I don’t know enough to say whether it is two or three or four, but I certainly believe there will be room for two. If you can be in the top two, you will have a very good business.”6. Ch-ch-ch-changes.“It’s open season on reinvention. Today everybody is in everybody else’s business”, Wenda Harris Hillard, chief sales officer at Yahoo, the internet media group, told Lions delegates.Recent deal-making has seen software companies buy agency groups and vice versa. Over a longer period, media buyers, digital companies and brands themselves have also all ventured into content-making.The ability of the internet to deliver converged media and services has only really exacerbated an existing trend which saw agency businesses already diversifying to train to gain a share of the value created when consumers are given the right commercial message, at the right time and in the right format.Marketing organisations which operate in silos – whether by function or by geography – are ill-suited to exploit this trend.Mr Stengel, of P&G, said: “Agencies all get that they have to change and they are trying. But they have to alter a lot of their structures, and profit centres and paradigms. And we as a client, have to be clearer about saying ’this is what we expect from you’.”FRIDAY JUNE 22: Climate change opportunitiesTHURSDAY JUNE 21: Brands to look out for in 2008WEDNESDAY JUNE 20:Microsoft pushes one-stop shopTUESDAY JUNE 19: In search of a business modelMONDAY JUNE 18: Big bets at Cannes Lions
690;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oakley founder shows fine eye for innovation;;Jim Jannard, chairman and founder of Oakley, the sports sunglasses company that is being bought by Italy’s Luxottica for $2bn, could be regarded as a southern Californian version of Phil Knight, chairman and founder of Oregon-based Nike.Both West Coast entrepreneurs set up companies in their garages and sold their first products by word-of-mouth grassroots marketing. Both built their companies around sports performance and design. And both stepped down as chief executive of the companies they founded within 12 months of each other.But unlike Mr Knight, Mr Jannard’s first love was motorcycles, rather than running, and he could never be accused of being a recluse. When he stepped down as chief executive, handing over to Scott Olivet, a former Nike executive, he joked that Oakley finally had “some adult supervision”, and promptly took the additional title “chief mad scientist”.He also contributes regularly to online bulletin boards discussing his latest project, the creation of a digital cinema camera that he argues can democratise Hollywood.As CEO, he also commissioned a headquarters building that is the opposite of Nike’s Oregon campus with its calming Japanese-style garden, opting instead for a fortress-like bunker with fighter jet ejector seats in the lobby, designed by the company’s own president, Colin Baden, an architect.On Thursday, with a degree of understatement, Mr Jannard noted that he and Luxottica’s Leonardo del Vecchio had entered the industry around the same time, he had taken a different path from the luxury and lifestyle focus of the Italians.His path into sports-related eyewear developed from Mr Jannard’s own love of moto-cross racing and his early career as a sales rep in the sport.He set up his company with $300 originally to produce new non-slip handlebar grips, which he named Oakley after his dog, after failing to persuade other manufacturers to adopt his ideas.“They would tell me to just shut up and sell. I realised that I was going to have a heart attack if I didn’t try to execute some of these ideas,” he told Transworld Motocross magazine in 2001.Mr Jannard sold his bike grips at moto-cross meetings, and their success with riders led to him to design goggles, with the launch of the Oakley O frame product in 1980. Then came a fledgling lightweight sports sunglasses business whose popularity was boosted by Greg Le Mond, the US cyclist who won the Tour de France three times and later by compatriot and seven times Tour winner Lance Armstrong. Oakley’s products are also know for their durability.Mr Jannard’s digital camera project, which has used Oakley’s lensmaking and research skills, reflects his own enthusiasm for film-making and film collecting. He also lists “funny car racing” – or drag racing – as one of his main interests, and Oakley is one of the main national sponsors of the National Hot Rod Association.On top of his existing fortune, Mr Jannard will now pocket around $1.2bn for his 63 per cent stake in Oakley. He said on Thursday that he was glad Luxottica “has come to understand the unique, rogue nature of Oakley”, and that he planned to invest in the merged company.
691;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-06-21T10:31:27Z;Cannes Diary: Brands to look out for in 2008;;THURSDAY JUNE 21The Wildfire seminar, jointly hosted by Leo Burnett, the advertising agency, and Contagious, a magazine of cutting edge media and marketing ideas, has become an annual “must-see” event at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival.This year’s seminar predictions for brands to watch in 2008 include:Joost - the peer-to-peer free internet television service being developed by the founders of Skype and Kazaa has a lot of hype to live up to. But with management’s strong track record, technology that works and an advertiser-friendly model, it also has assets. The big question seems to be, will it get the content people actually want to watch?Blyk - the pan-European advertising-funded mobile service. Sceptics scoff at the business model, but the service is priced at every teenager’s favourite level: free.Stifkas - Singaporean toymaker apparently a contender to be the next Lego. Go figure.Lifecake - a social networking website for creatives. (Just don’t offer to read their film scripts.)InterfaceFlor - interior design firm with a zeitgeisty mission to create green products.Seadragon - Microsoft technology for improving three-dimensional imaging which only makes sense when you see it in practice.Postscript: Like policemen, those social networking websiters seem to get younger by the day. Clubpenguin is a current favourite of the Wildfire people. Target group age group: 8-12 year olds (which makes it double as an informal babysitter). Estimated user base: 8m users.Lions Roar: “97 per cent of Nike Plus users say they would recommend the service to others. Mostly, we think we’re doing well when we hit 50 per cent.” Stefan Olander, global director digital and content, Nike.Lions Bore: From the official programme: ”Mental resilience expert Kamal Sarma reveals to delegates the mind techniques of the great creative masters. Karmal will teach particpants how to focus their minds at will and tap into that elusive white space often associated with creative genuis.” (If delegates weren’t experts in mental resilience when they went into this session, they surely would be when they came out.)WEDNESDAY JUNE 20: Microsoft pushes one-stop shopTUESDAY JUNE 19: In search of a business modelMONDAY JUNE 18: Big bets at Cannes Lions
692;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-06-10T18:14:50Z;Child labour caution for China Olympics;;"Licensed goods being made for next year’s Beijing Olympic Games are being manufactured by child labour and “sweatshops” in China, the Playfair Alliance says in a report published on Monday.Research found children as young as 12 producing Olympic merchandise. Playfair says that adults producing goods for the Beijing games earn as little as 14p an hour, half the legal minimum wage in China.Some employees were being made to work up to 15 hours a day for seven days a week, while factory owners were falsifying employment records and forcing workers to lie about their wages and conditions, the alliance said.Playfair groups together three international networks aiming to improve working conditions in the clothing and sportswear industries: the Clean Clothes campaign; the International Trade Union Confederation; and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation.International producers and retailers of consumer goods are increasingly sensitive that their image could be damaged by adverse publicity about employment conditions. Nike, the official supplier of footballs to the English Premier League, has only just resumed production of hand-stitched leather balls in Pakistan after halting work because of concerns over child labour.Undercover researchers working in factories in China’s Guangdong and Shenzhen provinces reported one manufacturer of stationery for the Olympics employing more than 20 children – the youngest just 12 years old. They had been hired during the school holidays and were working from 7.30am to 10.30pm, doing the same jobs as adults. The manufacturer imposed forced overtime, fines and paid less than half the legal minimum wage.A Shenzhen company, licensed to produce 50 different items for the games, was said to have used fake salary slips to dupe inspectors sent to check wages and conditions. Workers complained about health and safety, including fire hazards, skin problems from chemicals and respiratory problems from dust, said Playfair.Another Shenzhen-based factory, operated by Mainland Headwear, was claimed to have instructed employees how to lie to inspectors about wages and conditions and sacked workers who told the truth. Peter Ho, chief executive officer of the group, vigorously denied the allegations, saying the factory was audited by leading international brands who are members of the US Fair Labor Association.“Comparing our factory with a low margin sweatshop is outrageous when we so much believe in our social responsibility to help the poor and uplift the general well being of our future generations,” he said in a statement.Gus Ryder, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said: “We warned the International Olympic Committee at the time that failure to take the necessary action on labour standards would lead to situations such as those identified in the report.”Playfair’s report coincides with the arrival in Britain this week of IOC officials for a progress report on developments for the 2012 games. Campaigners fear that production of branded goods for the London games in cheaper locations will lead to similar exploitation.Maggie Burns, who chairs Labour Behind the Label, one of the UK representatives of Playfair, said: “The London Olympics has just spent £400,000 [€590,000 $788,000] on a logo. There is no reason why organisers cannot ensure a “sweat-free” games if they act now.”The International Olympic Committee said in a statement that it was concerned that licensed goods were sourced ethically, but stressed that Games licenses are issued by the organising committees of each Olympics, rather than by the IOC.“The IOC does not directly manage and control the production of Olympic-related products across the world - it has to do this by influence, and by creating standards and policies that are an important part of the process and agreed on by everyone involved in staging the Olympic Games,” it said.Jiang Xiaoyu, vice president of the Beijing Olympics organisaing committee (BOCOG) said the committee “is investigating and if the issue really exists then BOCOG will tackle this issue very seriously”."
693;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-06-06T11:26:32Z;JJB shares tumble as store sales fall;;JJB Sports said on Wednesday that group sales for the 18 weeks to June 3 had fallen by 1.2 per cent, with like-for-like sales down 1.8 per cent.However, analysts suspected there had been a sharp fall in its like-for-like retail sales and the shares fell 8.3 per cent or 22¾p to 250½p in early trading.The retailer and leisure group said in a trading update, that sales in its health clubs were up 21.9 per cent in the period. However, the group, where David Whelan, founder and an executive director, holds a 29 per cent stake, did not give a figure for the fall in sales in its stores in the statement. The company said total retail sales fell 3.1 per cent in the period but it declined to give a figure for like-for-like sales.In a note to clients, Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said that “back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that retail’s like-for-like [sales] has slowed considerably from around +1 per cent in the first nine weeks to a double-digit decline over the next nine weeks.”Numis Securities said it would cut its profit forecast for JJB and said the shares were a sell. It told clients it expected to reduce its forecast of pre-tax profits “by a couple of million” from its previous estimate of £48.6m for the year to January 2008. It set a share price target of 220p.The disappointing update comes ahead of a crucial European championship qualifier later on Wednesday in which England must defeat Estonia in Talin to qualify for next year’s tournament.JJB has said in the past that failure by England to qualify would hit sales of its replica England shirts which account for a considerable level of sales.The company said the figures for spring/summer 2006 had been buoyed by sales of England replica kits ahead of the World Cup. It said retail sales had risen 4.3 per cent in total in the first nine weeks of its current financial year but added that if last year’s World Cup sales were stripped out sales in the 18 weeks would have been up 2.6 per cent.The group achieved a rise in gross margins of 260 basis points in the 18 week period, and it said that “a significant part of the increase arose from the retail store results.”JJB said the introduction of Adidas and Nike in-store areas in its superstores were improving both sales and margins. So far it has Adidas in 83 stores and Nike in 53, and expected to reach 200 Adidas and 100 Nike in-store areas by the end of calendar 2007.The group’s 42 health clubs, up from 39 at the start of the financial year at the end of January, had a total of 181,200 members by May 31 compared to 153,000 at the same time in 2006.
694;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Nike to promote workers’ rights;;Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing brand, is to strengthen efforts to combat potential abuses of the 800,000 workers in its global supply chain with a push to promote labour rights, including the freedoms to form and join trades unions.The company says it will set up an educational programme on workers’ rights to freedom of association, to be implemented in all of its contract factories by 2011, the date the company has set for reaching $23bn (€17.1bn, £11.6bn) in sales.Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility, says the brand is now placing a greater effort on promoting “systemic” change in its supply chain, which would include strengthening the ability of factory workers to speak out on their own behalf about problems.“We believe constructive dialogue between workers and factory management leads to better conditions,” she said. In its latest corporate responsibility report, Nike acknowledges that the strategy of factory inspections embraced by leading brands since the mid-1990s has not eliminated endemic abuses such as unpaid wages and excessive overtime.“Across the industry we continue to see systemic issues affecting workers rights,” the report says.Since facing criticism over workplace abuses in the mid-1990s, Nike has become a standard-setter for efforts to improve supply chain conditions and other companies have followed its lead on corporate responsibility.The report acknowledges the political issues involved – around 65 per cent of Nike-brand footwear is made in China and Vietnam, where independent trade unions are illegal, but where some brands have experimented with “parallel association” through factory-based committees.Neil Kearney, an international trades union representative who reviewed the Nike report, said that a decade of factory monitoring efforts had led to a renewed interest in improving industrial relations at supplier factories.“A number of the leading corporations have now recognised that responsibility for workplace conditions needs to go back to where it belongs, with the employers, and with the relationship between employers and labour,” he said.The report also says that by 2011 Nike will eliminate all “excessive overtime” from its supplier factories – hours worked in excess of local laws or Nike’s code of conduct – in part through efforts by its buyers and design teams to avoid sudden increases in orders or product variations.Other brands, including Gap and Marks and Spencer, have also sought to integrate into their design and planning operations an awareness of the impact on decisions on suppliers.The UK-based Ethical Trading Initiative, which supports supply chain standards, is also focusing its attention on the issue, according to Alan Roberts, its chairman.“If excessive overtime is being created by design practices, then we have to make sure that the brands take responsibility for that,” he said.
695;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Nike gets new Pakistan football maker;;Nike, the official supplier of soccer balls to the English Premier Football League, is to resume making hand-stitched leather balls in Pakistan, six months after it stopped production there amid child-labour concerns.The company has signed a new contract with Silver Star, a leather processor based in Sialkot, after a tender process that Nike says was designed to promote a broader modernisation of the sector centred around the city in northern Punjab.The case has highlighted the challenges facing brands in the clothing and footwear industry over how to respond to persistent breaches of their codes that set minimum conditions for workers in their supply chains.Nike’s decision in November to end production at Saga, its former supplier in Sialkot, followed what Alan Marks, a company spokesman, said was “primarily a fundamental breach of trust” in its management over failures to remedy problems with labour conditions.Nike was the factory’s main client, taking around 80 per cent of its production, and many of the estimated 3,000 workers at the factory have subsequently lost their jobs. Saga was producing 6m of the 40m leather soccer balls produced in Pakistan annually.Unlike the global clothing business, where contracts can be moved relatively rapidly between factories and companies, the quality and scale of the leather industry in Sialkot is globally unique, leaving Nike with a significant shortfall in its supply of hand-stitched balls.The city’s leather stitching industry is largely informal and household based. This has combined with a lack of organised local labour groups and a repressive local political environment to stymie a decade of efforts by international buyers to eliminate child labour through monitoring programmes.Nike says Saga had originally agreed to use factory rather than home-based workers, but that local factory monitoring groups reported persistent problems last year.The new contract requires the new supplier to use only registered full-time employees paid hourly wages to work on its premises, rather than piece work. It also stipulates that its workers be able to form or join trade unions.However, the initial contract is for a fifth of the volume of balls originally produced for Nike by Saga, although Nike says it will buy more as Silver Star’s capacity develops.Ineke Zeldenrust, a labour rights advocate at the Clean Clothes Campaign, said Nike needed to “provide the prices and volume and long-term relationship” to support the new contractor, and that the impact of its efforts on the rest of the sector depended on the involvement of other brands.“If you want to do this, you need the other brands to be brought into the loop,” she said.The terms of the tender, drawn up in consultation with a range of local and international labour rights groups, also requires Silver Star to pursue the gradual automation and mechanisation of the ball manufacturing process in Pakistan.Nike points to the use of an Adidas machine-stitched ball at the last World Cup finals as an indication that the game’s use of hand-stitched balls is set to decline, creating future problems for Sialkot unless the industry modernises.
696;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-27T16:47:08Z;Pushing the boundaries;;"W ith the West Indies as hosts, the Cricket World Cup, which culminates today in Barbados, was always going to offer a contrast to the traditional image of the game. Cricket-­watch­­ing Caribbean style is about as far removed as can be imagined from the spectacle of MCC members crammed into Lord’s, wearing “scrambled eggs and smoked salmon”-striped ties, baking in blazers, and watching players in white flannels chase a red leather ball across a plush green outfield. Rather, for today’s final, most spectators are likely to opt for beach and carnival wear.The way cricket looks is changing. The first big shift in the style of the game came in 1979 with Australlian billionaire Kerry Packer’s decision to televise matches with players wearing pastel outffits rather than crickets “whites”. And, for more than a decade now, one-day games of the sort played at the World Cup have seen players wearing “pyjamas” in such vivid national colours as green and gold for Australia, black for New Zealand, and light blue for India. And with their taste for replica gear, the style of the fans in the stands has kept pace with that of the players.Indeed, since the last World Cup in 2003, Nike, Slazenger and Adidas have signed multi-million-dollar deals to provide kits for India, Pakistan and Australia, respectively, bringing further innovations in colour and fabric to the professional and armchair scene.The grandstands also feature a variety of “vintage” cricket looks. These include retro kits such as that of the 1992 World Cup, featuring England’s red, white and blue strip.Meanwhile, the Barmy Army – originally a travelling band of English cricket supporters – has been organised into a brand to market its own clothing lines. “The white polo shirt, listing dates and locations, that we produce for every tour and World Cup is considered a classic,” says Paul Burnham, the brand’s founder, who is seeking investors to fund expansion. Barmy Army derived its initial popularity from many cricket spectators’ desire to distance themselves from football fans and their sometimes rowdy and violent behaviour. “Before we came on the scene people, especially when they were following England abroad, might have worn their football teams’ strip,” Burnham recalls. “We wanted to be different.” Plenty of fans, he adds, also began to want something other than the nylon fabric used for football shirts then, especially fans in warm climates.The fashion ante was upped further by the recent arrival of 20/20 cricket – 20 overs a team, under floodlights with players’ favourite rock and pop songs accompanying them over the public address system as they walk to the batting crease – according to Mark Whitehead, founder of the internet outlet World Cricket Store. (Strangely to non-devotees, cricket is the world’s most web-centric sport – www.cricinfo.com is more visited than sites on other statistically rich sports like baseball, basketball and American football.)“Cricket is much more laid-back thanks to 20/20,” says Whitehead, who set up World Cricket Store 10 years ago and has outlets in Britain, Australia and India. “The game is also showcased more extensively than ever by satellite broadcasters, and icons like England’s Andrew Flintoff and India’s Sachin Tendulkar have broadened appeal.”Worldwide, demand for cricket fashion wear has grown during the build-up to the start of the 2007 World Cup last month. By mid-February, the website World Cricket Store was taking daily orders for up to 300 shirts (having previously sold an England top to Tony Blair’s son, Ewan). “Man for man, more supporters wear their country’s one-day kit in South Africa than anywhere else,” Burnham adds. “Tops are also popular in the West Indies, and in India and Pakistan those who can afford official gear (costing up to £40) wear that, while others buy copies.” World Cricket Store has even shipped a West Indies official World Cup top to New York.There remain those who favour more traditional cricket-going men’s wear. Michael Booth, chairman of the Jermyn Street shirtmakers Hilditch & Key and a regular at Lord’s, notes a popularity among his cricketwatching customers for lighter shades-, often in sea island cotton with a silk-like appearance. Ties, including traditional cricket colours, are usually bright to reflect the game’s summer calendar.Jeremy Hackett, who founded the Hackett clothing range and, from his south-London home, notes trends among crowds heading for the nearby Oval cricket ground, claims that many of his British clients who play as well as watch the game favour a white cable sweater with red and blue V-neck that evokes the Union Jack. Also popular are flannel shirts with long sleeves harking back to the 1950s, when a bowler might run to the wicket with cuffs flapping.What formal cricket-wear lacks, however, is some sense of a personal connection with the game and players, says Barmy Army’s Burnham. He believes the success of his merchandise, much of which commemorates particular tours and on-field success, reflects the fact that spectators want to feel they’re more than just benign observers (no matter that, in England’s case, performance on the field during the World Cup hardly encouraged association).“It’s for those who want to be able to say this summer and beyond: ‘I was there,’ ” he says, “like people who attend pop concerts.” When it comes to clothes, therefore, Wembley arena and a cricket stadium in the West Indies may be closer than you think.Fashion pitchwww.worldcricketstore.com

Rather, the ad, aired at half-time during a recent qualifier for European football’s Champion’s League and spotted after midnight on ESPN in a central Beijing hotel, was by Li-Ning, China’s hottest sports label and one of several booming local brands determined to win a chunk of the international market.If anything sums up China’s ambition to be a significant presence in fashion, it is brands such as Li-Ning or its rival, Qiaodan, a label that Chinese pronounce rather like, well…Jordan.Though unknown in the west, Li-Ning, named after its founder, China’s 1984 treble Olympic gold-medal-winning gymnast, posts sales in excess of $300m and is quoted on the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change. Meanwhile, Qiaodan has grown into a $125m brand in ready-to-wear alone with more than 3,000 sales points.Fashion at all price levels is booming in China and local brands have played rough and fast with intellectual property rights, tapping into consumer demand for cool foreign labels with inexpensive local simulacrums. Li-Ning‘s curvy logo uncannily ressembles Nike’s famous Swoosh, for example, while its current advertising campaign slogan, “Anything is Possible”, is awfully close to Adidas’s “Nothing is Impossible”.Meanwhile, Qiaodan’s Air Jordan-like logo graces all its sneakers, which consistently retail in China at less than half the price of competing western brands.Intellectual property rights are extremely difficult to prove in the fashion world in contrast to the situation in the technology field.But while one can buy Nike copies in every market in Beijing, the US brand garnered most media attention in China for a case in which it, rather than its many imitators, was on trial. In 2004, a Beijing-based court ordered Nike to pay Zhu Zhiqiang, a 28-year-old Chinese cartoonist, $10,000 for plagiarism over a stickman television advert that Goliath sportswear company broadcast in China (the court held the figure had originally been designed by Zhu). A higher court overturned the decision but it was the early ­verdict that provoked infinitely more Chinese internet chatter.Li-Ning did not respond to questions this week about the similarity of its logo and the Nike swoosh, while Charlie Brooks, Nike UK’s head of corporate communications, said, “Where we identify a clear breach of our trademark or intellectual property rights, Nike will act accordingly.”Meanwhile, many brands in China continue to sail close to the intellectual property wind, and not just the sports brands. Does the BeautyBerry label ring a bell? It is not the cosmetics division of the UK label famous for its plaid but a lingerie line from Guangzhou. Or how about Chinese clothing brands Polanni or Baroco, just letters away from the exclusive accessories label Pollini and the youth-orientated Rocco Barocco, two Italian fashion houses that show on Milan’s runway season and sell in China.“We’ve even come across a label called Tog’s, not Tod’s. They can imitate graphics shamelessly in China. And fashion icons are ruthlessly exploited. Take Audrey Hepburn, whose image is used to sell tea here,” says Anthony Bednall, an experienced designer and professor at Ruffles, a Beijing fashion college.Still, with north Beijing an enormous construction site for the 2008 Olympics, the key battleground is in sports wear. Underlining Li-Ning’s ambitions, the label finalised, back in 2002, an endorsement deal with the Spanish men’s and women’s basketball teams, and, last August, signed the American basketball star Shaquille O’Neal for a new line of shoes.By contrast, Qiaodan recognises that it cannot compete directly with existing global labels so, when it comes to apparel, it avoids using expensive state-of-the-art “breathable” high-tech fabrics – exactly the sort that athletes will don in the Beijing Games when summer temperatures are expected to soar into the high 30s.“There are 1.3bn people in China but the vast majority are working or lower middle class, so there is no point in producing the sort of expensive goods you get from the west,” says Ding Guo Ding, director-general of Qiaodan.As to the sound-alike Qiaodan name, Ding says, simply: “This is very sensitive matter and we note that our brand name is fully legal here. We have registered the name a long time ago and have even done so in the west, for instance, in Spain.“All the young people are crazy about exercise in China. We intend to supply what they want.”
698;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-25T18:49:55Z;New and old media collide;;"Rupert Murdoch and about 60 top executives will hang out together in California this week to try to find some answers to how news can become a boom business on the web.Murdoch is a newsman at heart and News Corp has built up a strong position in many of the markets it operates in: Fox News Channel in the US, The Times and Sun newspapers in London, and The Australian.The News Corp meeting will also include MySpace founders Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson. What they say about news may not be encouraging for their old media colleagues, however.Indications from the news site recently started by MySpace – the popular social networking site bought by Murdoch a couple of years ago – shows that its youthful users rank the stories on fashions and astrology as more interesting than hard news.Yesterday, for instance, John McCain’s plans to outline his case for the US presidency was number two on MySpace’s list, topped by an item about MapQuest navigation being available in cars. The death of Boris Yeltsin barely featured.The bet, presumably, is that the internet generation will become more interested in news as it gets older.Making niceIt is no secret that Burma and North Korea are Asia’s two least popular countries. Both are run by repressive authoritarian regimes, both are branded as “outposts of tyranny” by the US, and both are treated with wary distaste by other Asian governments.Until recently, they weren’t too fond of each other, either. Burma’s military rulers cut diplomatic ties with North Korea in 1983 after four South Korean cabinet ministers were killed in a bombing in Rangoon carried out by North Korean commandos during a visit by Chun Doo-hwan, then South Korea’s president .But in the past few years, the two countries appear to have quietly made peace. That courtship is expected to culminate on Thursday with the formal restoration of diplomatic ties during a visit to Burma by North Korea’s vice-foreign minister.Neither government has said anything publicly about the trip – hardly surprising given both regimes’ penchant for secrecy. But analysts note that Burma is rich in natural resources and covets weapons and nuclear technology – areas in which North Korea could potentially help.It looks like the makings of a beautiful friendship.Election 2.0The revolution may not be televised, but you can bet the 2008 US presidential election will appear on YouTube.A bipartisan alliance has appealed to the Republican and Democratic National Committees, asking them to ensure all presidential debate video can be legally posted on websites.Internet luminaries, including the Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig and the founders of Wikipedia and Craigslist, want debate footage from candidates to be put in the public domain or issued under the liberal Creative Commons licence. This enables it to be “legally shared, re-used, and blogged about without fear of legal repercussion”.If the committees say No, webcast presidential debates are still likely to go ahead. Yahoo, The Huffington Post and Slate have announced plans for two online-only debates.The debates, to take place after Labor Day in September, will be simulcast live in video on all three sites, and viewers will be able to ask questions in real time.Candidates and their supporters have already been using the latest Web tools to reach voters in new ways. MySpace pages abound, there have been YouTube political ads and appearances in the SecondLife virtual world, and John Edwards uses the new Twitter.com messaging service to update followers on his whereabouts.Chilling out?Is Lee Kuan Yew, modern Singapore’s founder and stern patriarch, mellowing with age? Recent comments by the 83-year-old elder statesman suggest so.First Lee said that the city-state should probably decriminalise its Victorian-era laws against homosexuality to keep pace with the modern world.Then he revealed that he wants to join the campaign against global warming.“We must do our best to show that we are as active and responsible as we can be. I am a great believer that we have to be a part of the movement,” said Lee, suddenly displaying the passion of Al Gore when asked by Observer about the issue at a public forum.But whether actions will match the rhetoric remains an open question. A film about a gay affair between a teacher and his student was dropped from the current Singapore International Film Festival because the censors wanted to cut what they said were explicit sex scenes.If the shoe fitsDid Nike give its longtime advertising agency Wieden & Kennedy the boot? Not exactly; but it did take away its running shoes.The athletic gear company has hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky, the hip, Miami-based group, to manage its running shoe and Nike ID accounts. Meanwhile, Weiden, the Portland, Oregon, company that created some of Nike’s iconic advertising – including the line “Just do it” – will continue to work with Nike on other accounts, according to a representative.Rumour has it other Nike businesses are up for grabs as well, but there is no word yet on which agencies will win these coveted accounts.

699;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-17T22:25:49Z;Expensive defensive stocks;;Compared with their bond market peers, investors in US equity markets remain notoriously optimistic in their economic outlook. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. Dig a little deeper, though, and the message is a lot less clear than the near doubling of the S&P 500 since its 2002 trough would suggest.For one thing, shares have lagged behind rapidly expanding earnings. That has left the market as a whole trading at just over 15 times underlying earnings on Standard & Poor’s bottom up estimates for 2007, leading some to conclude that even a few quarters of lacklustre growth need not spoil the party. But the aggregate hides as much as it reveals.Among the sectors commanding high price/earnings multiples, a revealingly large number are in areas that should do comparatively well during a downturn. Consumer staples, for example, trade at about 18 times earnings. This is roughly matched by such businesses as Anheuser-Busch or PepsiCo. Companies credited with earnings growth potential, such as Procter & Gamble or WM Wrigley, are a lot dearer still.Similarly, the slightly more cyclical consumer discretionary sector, which includes media companies and the likes of Target, McDonald’s and Nike, trades at about 20 times earnings. Healthcare, telecommunications and utilities are also valued more highly than the broader market, if less aggressively so. Among classic favourites in rising markets, by contrast, only information technology commands a premium rating.For the S&P 500 as a whole, all of this is offset by the low ratings of financials – the largest earnings contributor by far – and energy. Investors are certainly wise not to expect peak-level earnings in those industries to last forever. Unfortunately, in the process, they have also driven up relative valuations of more defensive sectors – including ones with fairly direct exposure to slowing consumer spending. The mundane headline valuation of the S&P 500 may offer far less protection than at first appears if and when peak profits begin to fall.
700;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-17T16:15:39Z;I think the cleaner has pinched my Nike trainers;;"Recently I spotted our office cleaner wearing an unusual pair of Nike shoes. I owned a similar pair that had recently vanished from under my desk. I don’t have any proof he took them (I might have left them on the train), I don’t care about the shoes and I don’t want to get the guy into trouble. But I don’t want him cleaning the office any more in case anything valuable goes missing.Financial PR, male, 37……………………………………..LUCY KELLAWAY: THE ANSWERYou have four options, none of them terribly appealing.
1. Confront him and ask him where he got his shoes from. I don’t recommend this: even if he did help himself to your old pair, he will deny it. The conversation will be excruciating for both of you and won’t get you anywhere.
2. Report the incident to your boss (or to his), on the grounds that if you have good reason to suspect him of theft your boss should know. The trouble is that even if you are careful to say that you don’t have any proof, the cleaner will almost certainly be fired without more ado. You will then have that on your conscience, which won’t feel nice.
3. You leave the cleaner alone but take better care of your things. This is superficially reasonable, though I’m still not keen. If you work in the sort of office where people leave things hanging about, that is a perk of the job. A trusting environment is a pleasant one.
4. Do nothing at all. This is the best option, though the problem then becomes what to do with your nasty lurking suspicion. I suggest you simply squash it and let your inner liberal (who doesn’t want to get the guy into trouble) have free rein.Comfort yourself with the thought that someone who nicks second-hand shoes and wears them under the nose of the person they took them from is not likely to be a big time larcenist who will go for your laptop. Tell yourself that your shoes are now either in the lost property at Baker Street or on the feet of the cleaner, and that the second possibility would be better as it ensures the greatest happiness of the greatest number.TRAINER TRASH
Didn’t it dawn on you that your cleaner might have thought you were throwing the Nikes
away? (The fact that you may have left them on the train shows you
really don’t have a clue.) Leave the poor cleaner alone – the Nikes were probably the bonus of the year for him. From the sound of things, he could have just as easily found them in the bargain
bin at the charity shop.Travel manager, male, 38SHOP HIM
You can’t afford to have someone in the office you don’t trust. As you think he stole your shoes, you have a duty to tell your boss. You never know what he could steal next. How your boss then responds is up to him. It’s not your problem.Art student, female, 20BACK OFF
The cleaner leapt to the conclusion that you had discarded the Nikes. You’ve leapt to the conclusion that he stole them. Back off. Tell him that things on, around or under your desk are not cast-offs. I doubt anything else will disappear.CEO, male, ancientA DOGGIE TREAT?
Years ago a colleague who liked to keep chocolates on his desk decided to take action against the inevitable pilferages. He swapped them for doggie chocolate treats. It was worth it just to discover that a much-disliked manager had been scarfing the treats at night. He even pronounced them delicious. Woof! Woof!Consultant, female, 37LOCK UP YOUR THINGS
This one’s easy. Lock up your belongings and remember that your company isn’t responsible for your personal property. Also, I’m sure your colleagues might appreciate it if you didn’t keep a pile of sneakers under your desk. Eew.Banker, male, 39MINGING TRAINERS
Cleaners are always prime suspects for office thefts but in my longexperience it’s nearly all employees, with a tiny remainder down totraditional burglary. My advice is to presume the Nike-clad cleaner innocent and take personal stuff home, especially minging sportswear.Manager, male, 45TALK TO HIM
We dealt with a similar problem by explaining to the cleaner he was in a position of trust and it was his responsibility that none of the things in the areas he cleaned went missing. If yours has half a brain and it was him who took your trainers he will get the message, and should anything else disappear you will have just cause for dismissing him.Freelance, male, 30s……………………………………………THE NEXT PROBLEM"
701;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Dressing for the races;;"To train racehorses in Britain, you have to be issued a licence by the Jockey Club. Part of the process involves an interview in London. In 2003, when I switched from raising dairy and beef cattle to racing – full time after the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 – I travelled up to town from the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales, where my stables are, to see the licensing committee. No-one at the Jockey Club was in much doubt that I was a farmer. As I learnt, appearances count. Especially at the races on big days like today’s Grand National – I ran State of Play on Thursday, the first day of the meeting at Aintree, Pole Star yesterday, and saddle a runner today in the charity “people’s” race. How I look reflects on my stable.In my previous life as a farmer, market day was the smartest of the week. For some, including my father and grandfather, both farmers, dress had to be best ”bib and tucker”, like a traditional Sunday. Maybe I didn’t dress up for market like them but, even with an open-necked shirt, I was careful to be at least presentable. My Levi 501 jeans would be restored with a wash beforehand, and I’d choose a Pringle sweater without any holes. I’ve always tried to be on the right side of smart and worry in situations when I’m wearing a tie, like at the Jockey Club, that my top
button might be showing.My luck was marrying one of four sisters. After the wedding, my wardrobe underwent something of a revolution, which at least helped before my visit to the Jockey Club. My daughters also buy my cuff-links, now pretty much every Christmas and birthday. As for my son, who is 15, he is much more clothes-orientated than I was at his age. I’d happily play football in
Wellingtons. Him? He wouldn’t leave the house in anything other than Nike.Truthfully, I’ve always practically lived in waterproofs and Wellingtons. The problem now is with the riding in the morning: when we exercise the horses, the waterproofs rub, so I go through three or four more pairs a year than before. These days, they really have to be lightweight to move freely in the saddle, and the fabric has to breathe or you really sweat. The latest design I have tried, with some success, is from Marks and Spencer. As for Wellingtons, when I am riding, I should really change into Stylo stable-boots. I don’t always remember. I used to wear a Nora Wellington, which had a less shaped foot and was much heavier. Hunters, which I now favour, fit into a stirrup.At the smaller race meetings, I might manage with a pair of cords; as for bloodstock sales, I’ve got Tommy Hilfiger body warmers in black, brown and navy now, from Howell’s, the main department store in Cardiff. But for big days, like this week at Aintree, I’ll always wear a suit. About 80 per cent of those I own come from a shop in Cardiff called Hawkes Essentials, which has an alterations service. Nothing flash for me. I am looking for something that is nicely cut and reasonably durable. As a National Hunt trainer, I am busiest during the winter so wool is preferable.A coat is my main extravagance. It has to be well made with some wear as the outer layer can take a battering in the process of putting a saddle on a big steeplechaser. A cheap coat won’t last, so I have one in velvet from Austin Reed and another – my best – by Aquascutum. Hopefully, whatever I wear when I’m saddling runners this week can be restored by my dry cleaners.Before State of Play ran on Thursday, I walked the course to see if there was any advantage in taking a particular route. This is routine for a trainer. I can wear Wellingtons for this. But you don’t want to be changing your shoes all the time on a day like today. So, for the big occasions, I bought a pair of brogue boots by Bertie in brown. When I remember to polish them, they can still manage a shine that should survive once round the course at Aintree.As told to Colin Cameron"
702;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-12T09:46:32Z;PPR chief rules out higher Puma offer;;"Francois-Henri Pinault, chief executive of PPR, on Thursday categorically ruled out raising its €5.3bn offer for German sporting goods group Puma.PPR is offering Puma shareholders €330 a share after paying the same amount for a 27.1 per cent stake in the world’s third-largest sporting goods group. But shares in Puma are trading significantly above the offer price; in mid-day Frankfurt trade on Thursday they were €343.46.”I won’t increase my price…I would be fine with 27 per cent,” Mr Pinault said in response to a question by the FT at a joint press conference of the two companies.His comments will dash hopes from investors of a sweetened offer. PPR’s 27 per cent stake – a blocking minority – also limits the chances of a counter bid from the likes of Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company.Mr Pinault said his bid was ”full and final” even if a hostile counter bid materialised.Puma is backing PPR’s bid as the French luxury goods group and retailer has offered to retain its management and independence. Puma is also hoping to use PPR’s retail expertise to help its growth."
703;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-10T20:41:02Z;Pinault stands firm on Puma bid;;François-Henri Pinault, PPR’s chief executive, on Tuesday said he was comfortable with the 27 per cent stake his group had bought in Puma and that its €330 a share offer for the whole of the company was “firm and definitive”, as markets indicated they expected a higher offer or counterbid.Analysts believe that the €5.3bn ($7bn) takeover from the French retailer undervalues Puma, the world’s third-largest sporting goods group. Puma’s shares closed up 9.4 per cent at €343.93.PPR’s shares also reacted positively, rising 3.2 per cent. But Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, said it might reduce the retailer to a junk rating from investment grade if the takeover were successful.Puma is a departure for luxury-focused PPR in spite of the German group’s enjoying significantly higher margins than rivals such as Nike and Adidas due to its focus on fashion.But Puma’s share price had stalled in the past year – despite its sponsoring of Italy, the football World Cup winning team – as investors fretted that it would sacrifice some of its industry-leading profitability for growth.Jochen Zeitz, Puma’s chief executive, defended the price being offered as “fair” and said the multiple was in line with what Adidas paid two years ago for Reebok – which had margins a third the level of Puma’s.Pushed on the matter, Mr Zeitz added: “It is not a price that I have set. It was between the buyer and the seller.”Under the terms of the offer – which follows PPR’s buying the 27.1 per cent stake held by the Herz siblings, billionaire heirs of the Tchibo coffee fortune – PPR intends to keep Puma’s current management and assure its independence. It was highly likely that Puma would remain listed, said people involved in the deal.Speculation surrounding a Nike bid had swirled around Puma for several years but Mr Zeitz said there had never been talks or an approach. A counterbidder would have a hard time as PPR would already have a blocking minority of 27 per cent and the two or three out of six supervisory board seats that come with the Herz stake.PPR is likely to support Puma in its aggressive growth strategy but also to help it expand its own retail operations.“There was a sense that Puma had taken their strategy as far as it could go but now we can help them,” said a person close to PPR.PPR could also have an impact on Puma’s previous reluctance to consider acquisitions, analysts said.“I can see PPR at least envisaging some kind of sports conglomerate,” said Eugenio di Maria, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence in Europe. He added that the Puma deal was a smart move by Mr Pinault as it added a new, unexplored front in his and his father’s battle against Bernard Arnault, head of rival LVMH.
704;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-04-10T12:56:46Z;PPR and Puma;;Feeding a fetish for the latest sports shoes can be one of modern life’s more expensive habits. PPR, the French luxury and retail group controlled by the Pinault family, presumably had this in mind when it made its takeover offer for Puma yesterday. PPR’s tactics recall those used in another recent bid for a German icon – Porsche’s for Volkswagen. In both cases, having already secured a blocking stake, the bidder need not worry much if minority investors prove reluctant to take up the offer for their shares.To be fair, having bought the Herz family’s 27 per cent stake in Puma, PPR was not obliged to make a full bid. The fact that it did so anyway suggests some substance to its stated strategy. Puma straddles sportswear and luxury goods with its wares gracing dancefloors and running tracks. Its challenge is to take market share from bigger rivals Nike and Adidas while maintaining the cachet and premium margins of its brand. PPR can help with the latter, where its own strengths lie.For PPR, given that pure luxury targets are few and expensive, Puma, while a hybrid, is close enough. The Herz family, which bought into Puma in 2005 and watched the shares tread water through 2006, has almost doubled its money. Its stake should block any rival bidders, especially since it also brings three of Puma’s six supervisory board seats.A partial buy-out upfront means that PPR does not necessarily have to sell off other businesses to pay for this foray. Sales are still worth considering. Even if Puma were fully consolidated, PPR would depend on the mature French market for 41 per cent of revenues, and retain a high weighting in lower-margin retail activities. Some disposals in that area would lend further credibility to the Puma deal’s rationale.

The rally pushed the benchmark index above its 30-day moving average, an encouraging technical sign for bulls.“What the market needed was for the Fed to show some flexibility in these troubling times, and they did just that,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The markets are starting to stabilise and put into perspective some of the concerns that led to the recent sell-off.”The S&P closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,436.11, its fifth successive day of gains that put it up 3.5 per cent on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent on Friday to 12,481.01.The recovery came as Blackstone, the buy-out group, prompted reflection on the recent private equity boom by filing for an initial public offering to raise $4bn.Energy stocks made the biggest gains this week, buoyed by both rising oil prices and broad strength in equities. The S&P Energy index stands at its highest point since December,
17.3 per cent above its low for the year.Exxon stock surged 7.4 per cent to $75.02 this week, while Chevron rose 8.3 per cent to $73.70. The odd one out in the sector was Halliburton, the oil services group, which slid 3.1 per cent to $31.08 after warning about weak US demand.Homebuilders began to make headway on the back of sound housing data.Sales of existing homes and housing starts were both in excess of depressed expectations.Concerns about tighter mortgage lending standards hitting demand for homes checked the gains. The S&P Homebuilders index rose
2.4 per cent this week, but remains more than 20 per cent off its high for the year.KB Home, which said it still envisaged instability in the market, rose 3.3 per cent to $46.86.Morgan Stanley was the latest investment bank to dispel fears about possible subprime mortgage losses.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,455.18 on Friday, up 3.5 per cent on the week.The sector was lifted by software groups Oracle and Adobe and the flash-memory maker SanDisk, which all reported strong earnings on Monday. Oracle, boosted by reports that it was suing its German rival SAP, finished the week 9.2 per cent higher at $18.24.But Motorola’s woes eventually soured the mood. The company admitted that performance at its mobile devices division had been “unacceptable” as it gave a profit warning. Motorola fell 2.5 per cent to $17.75.The troubles dragged down chipmakers, with Broadcom falling 5.3 per cent to $32.32. Palm also suffered losses. The fortunes of the maker of the Treo phone waxed and waned this week as rumours of an impending offer swirled round the market. Motorola was considered a potential buyer. Palm stock fell from a high of $19.45 to stand 1.5 per cent up on the week at $18.10.Vonage stock plunged 25.9 per cent to $3 on Friday after a judge blocked the company from infringing patents owned by Verizon when directing its customers’ internet telephone calls to landlines."
706;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Man who made a career out of cool;;"As a self-confessed Japan enthusiast, Mark Parker continues something of a corporate tradition at the head offices of Nike, the world’s largest sportswear company and a pioneer in branding.Phil Knight, the company’s co-founder, famously turned his inner office into a rarely entered sanctum of Zen-like simplicity, and installed a Japanese garden in the company’s campus-like headquarters in Portland, Oregon.Mr Parker, 51, has an office that recalls another Japanese aesthetic. His desk is a flat glass display case, with a collection of miniature model sports shoes, badges and other Nike memorabilia. Toys stand on his shelves, including a neat line of small, Japanese-looking robots, with mechanical-looking sculptures and strange rubber transformations of Nike shoes.“I keep it in the office because my wife won’t let it in the house,” he says of a collection that seems more otaku than Zen, suggesting an obsessive love of collecting cool stuff.Mr Parker is, after all, a man who has made a career out of cool stuff – he joined Nike in 1979 as a shoe designer, playing a leading role in the development of Nike’s design and technology, including setting up its first sports laboratory. As chief executive he still likes to drop in to review new products, sometimes offering suggestions. “Mark is a product freak,” jokes Mario LaFortune, the scientist who heads Nike’s research lab.Mr Parker’s elevation to chief executive in January last year from a position as co-head of the Nike brand followed a brief and mutually unsatisfactory spell under Bill Perez, who joined Nike from S.C. Johnson, the household products company. Mr Perez indicated at the time that there had been clashes with Mr Knight, who retained the chairman’s role.Now Mr Knight has moved out of the old office in the John McEnroe building that he held on to during Mr Perez’s 13-month tenure. His new office in the campus’s Mia Hamm building lies far away on the other side of the company’s Japanese garden, lake andsoccer field.The symbolic move, says Mr Parker, was Mr Knight’s decision. “I’ve worked with him for many, many years and what I’ve liked about that relationship is that he’s always given me incredible freedom in my roles.”Over the past year, Mr Parker’s team has overhauled the way Nike runs, shifting the brand away from the previous sub-brand and product-based structure to organise itself in six “customer focused” categories, such as running, basketball and women’s fitness.He argues that this aligns the company with the changes wrought by the digital revolution, by helping it to develop communities of shared interests.The reorganisation has highlighted Mr Parker’s continuing relationship with Charlie Denson, with whom he previously shared the job of Nike brand president. Both joined the company at about the same time, with Mr Denson rising through the sales team.“Our relationship is incredibly healthy,” says Mr Parker. “We poke each other all the time, we debate; it’s a part of the process.”Where Mr Denson has the suave assurance of the salesman, though, Mr Parker’s style suggests a self-effacing but friendly physics professor. He even stops at one moment to expound on a business book that looks at the roles of Newtonian physics and chaos theory in corporations.“We’re actually very proud of the fact that there is that synergy between us, and it has great influence on the rest of the company . . . People saw us in the co-president situation: they saw us working together and they saw how we complemented each other. And it sort of inspires the same sort of team work.”Nike, he argues, thrives on this combination of creative types and systematic types. “There are left brainers and right brainers and there’s a power in that mix of people that enables us to do things that are interesting.”With its self-contained suburban campus and its founding father lurking in the corridors, the world headquarters could become dangerously introverted – a potential threat to its ability to stay in touch with its customers and to pursue innovation.“I do think there’s a risk of that, and the antennae are up quite high on that one,” says Mr Parker, who has personally shaped Nike’s innovation processes. Since setting up its first research and development laboratory he has also established a group for pursuing long-range innovation, called Explore.“I set up Explore because I was worrying about Nike innovation becoming too insular,” he says, describing the group as pursuing “deep space” innovation possibilities with academics, inventors and other companies. “Everybody we have here can offer X, but if we tap into the talent that’s out there it becomes X cubed.”Explore, he points out, was chiefly responsible for the co-operation with Steve Jobs and Apple that led to last year’s launch of the Nike Plus programme. This allows Nike shoes to send data (about a runner’s distance and time, for example) to their iPod, which can then be downloaded to a PC. The strong demand for the product – and the creation of an online community – was a significant factor in persuading Mr Parker and Mr Denson to pursue the reorganisation of Nike’s management into customer categories.“Taking the best of what Nike does and the best of what Apple does and doing something that neither of us could have done on our own, I think that represents the future,” he says.As chief executive, he personally tries to reach outside the company, to stay in touch. When he travels on business, he says, he tries to get away from the company to visit “artists, graffiti artists and small shop owners” whom he sees as “the influencers of the influencers” in popular culture.And his biggest challenge is to match the opportunities with resources, something he compares with a vast and complex mathematical equation, mixed with the art of managing human chemistry.If it all works, the end result should be more miniature models of cool stuff to add to the collection under his desk. “Ultimately, a consumer votes on a company by buying a product,” he says. “So I guess you could call product the bottom line.”The runners who built shoesWhen Nike’s chief executive jokes that many of the company’s top managers are “ex-athletes trying desperately to stay in shape”, he includes himself.As a student at Penn State University, Mike Parker was a member of the track and cross-country running teams, and regularly ran up to 20 miles a day.That led to his first job with Nike in 1979 and also to his meeting his wife, Kathy Mills, who ran for Penn State and broke the world women’s 5,000m record in 1978.Mr Parker says that ageing knees and other injuries now mean that he generally restricts his own sporting activities to cycling – a black bike stands in one corner of his office, ready to be taken out on the track that runs around the Nike campus in Beaverton, a suburb of Portland.Its other facilities include two gyms, a climbing wall and a swimming-pool.Mr Parker’s short-lived predecessor Bill Perez, now chief executive of Wrigley, was also an active runner, with a number of marathons under his belt.And Nike was famously founded in 1972 from the relationship between Bill Bowerman, the coach of the University of Oregon running team who wanted to make better shoes, and Phil Knight, one of his runners."
707;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-01-10T22:11:07Z;Big retailers unify to fight labour abuses;;The world’s largest retailers have for the first time agreed on a unified set of workplace standards aimed at eliminating problems such as child labour and unpaid wages in their vast global supply chains.Wal-Mart, Tesco, Carrefour and Metro – the world’s four largest supermarket chains, with more than $500bn (€384bn) in aggregate annual sales – have been working with Migros, the largest Swiss retailer, to develop a draft code of standards called the Global Social Compliance Programme.The programme includes standards drawn from the companies’ existing codes of ethics and will also set out goals aimed at standardising a range of competing monitoring initiatives to combat “audit fatigue” among suppliers.“The ultimate objective is to improve conditions in the supply chain,” said Alan McClay, chief executive of CIES, an international association of food retailers and suppliers that is heading the initiative.The code will cover both food and non-food production for retailers and brands – making it potentially the most sweeping initiative since the emergence of the supply-chain monitoring movement a decade ago.However, it has received a cautious response from labour rights advocates concerned they have not been consulted in the formation of the initiative, and are excluded from a direct role in its governing board.Instead, CIES wants non-governmental organisations and labour groups to join an advisory board that it says would be vital for its credibility.Ineke Zeldenrust, of the Clean Clothes Campaign, one of the largest European anti-sweatshop groups, said she would welcome efforts by the large retailers to address supply-chain issues “but what I see now is a talking shop. We’d like to see them actually join one of the better existing initiatives and actually implement their codes …What we don’t need is another platform to discuss codes or standards.”CIES’s board approved the new draft code in December. Mr McClay said details would be made public in a month or so.The initiative marks the first time that large general retailers, rather than brands such as Nike or manufacturers such as Mattel and Hasbro, have become involved in creating a common set of global supplier standards.Even without full support of independent “stakeholders”, the purchasing power of the participants will exert considerable influence over the field.“They are so huge that people are going to be drawn in,” said one labour rights activist.The involvement of Wal-Mart is the latest sign of the company’s drive to improve its reputation on social and environmental issues.
708;NKE;Nike Inc;2007-01-10T09:02:00Z;Replica kits boost JJB Sports;;JJB Sports on Wednesday said its Christmas trading performance had been “satisfactory” and in line with expectations, as increased demand for replica kits of Premiership football clubs helped lift revenues and gross profits.The UK’s largest publicly quoted sports retailer, which also runs health clubs, also said it expected new distribution arrangements with Nike and Adidas, and the growing roll-out of combined health clubs and retail stores, to contribute to higher profits.Tom Knight, chief executive, said the group expected full-year profit of £40m, in line with analysts’ expectations.Total revenue in the 22 weeks to December 31 rose 6 per cent and it saw like-for-like revenue 6.3 per cent higher compared to last year.However, total revenue for the five weeks to December 31 was 4.5 per cent higher compared with the same period in 2005, with like-for-like revenue up 5.4 per cent.Retail stores revenue increased 4.9 per cent in the last period of 2006, with a “satisfactory” increase in gross profits following the growing demand of Premiership teams replica kit and the securing of marketing rights to Glasgow Rangers.Membership and revenue in JJB’s health clubs unit increased in the second half of 2006, the group said. However, due to planning and building delays JJB will only be able to open seven of the 12 combined retail and health club outlets it had anticipated in its last interim statement.“I am pleased with JJB’s trading performance throughout the current accounting period, including around Christmas and New Year,” said Roger Lane-Smith, non-executive chairman.“Looking forward to 2007, I believe that the progress we have made following the introduction of new distribution arrangements with Nike and Adidas gives us the opportunity to further emphasise our ‘Serious about Sport’ stance and that the continuing roll-out of combined health clubs/superstores, will result in an increased contribution to profits from our leisure division”.JJB shares slipped ¼p to 228¾p in early London trading. The stock has been buoyed in recent weeks by persistent takeover speculation, but David Greenwood, finance director, said on Wednesday: “Had we been approached, we would have to tell the Takeover Panel – but we haven’t been approached by anybody.”Analyst outlook for 2007 remains positive, as the group’s performance has improved steadily, with strong growth and increasing sales.Mark Charnock at Investec Securities said: “As we look out towards 2007, the year ahead will see some drag from the lack of a World Cup to boost sales. However, the business looks to us to be in better shape than for some time.”
709;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-12-28T17:09:14Z;FDI in India expected to double;;Foreign direct investment (FDI) in India this fiscal year is expected to double to $11bn but will still be dwarfed by inflows to neighbouring Asian countries such as China and Singapore, a new report shows.In a year-end review released this week, Kamal Nath, India’s minister of commerce and industry, said FDI inflows were expected to surpass $11bn in 2006-07, compared with $5.5bn the previous year.”There have been huge investments coming in the software industry, financial services and manufacturing,” said Mr Nath.From April to September the largest surges of FDI were in telecoms, energy, services, electrical equipment and transportation.Mr Nath cited loosening government policies and simplification of procedures as driving the increase in FDI.While India has increased FDI levels in sectors such as telecoms to 74 per cent, investment in other sectors remain capped below 50 per cent or are entirely restricted.Retail is a point of contention for multi-brand international chains such as Wal-Mart and Tesco which must seek Indian partners to enter the fast-growing Indian market. Single-brand retailers such as Nike and Benetton are limited to 49 per cent FDI.FDI levels in India are tiny compared with flows into China, which last year reached $72.4bn. A report from the Economist Intelligence Unit this autumn projected that FDI in China would exceed $80bn in 2006.However, Rashmi Banga, an economist at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, based in New Delhi, pointed out that foreign investment could enter India through other channels such as foreign institutional investors (FII).Larger amounts of FDI are not a silver bullet because foreign money could be flowing into sectors that do not require outside investment and where domestic firms are competitive. “This may lead to taking out share of market from domestic firms,” said Ms Banga.“FDI in India can still go up quite a lot. But it has to be monitored closely so the direction of FDI is right,” she added.Behind mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore were the second- and third-largest recipients of FDI in the Asia region in 2005, attracting $36bn and $20bn, respectively, according to Unctad.Other members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) experienced their highest growth in FDI inflows. Indonesia, for example, attracted $5.3bn.The year-end review from the commerce ministry also showed that India’s industrial production increased more than 10 per cent between April and October, with manufacturing growing 11.2 per cent compared with the same period the previous year. Manufacturing growth targets of 12 per cent are likely to be reached this fiscal year.In addition, it reported that since India enacted new patent laws in January 2005 as part of WTO negotiations, more than 25,000 patent applications and 180,000 trademarks were filed. The new patent regime grants product patents for pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals.

The company also reiterated its fiscal 2007 guidance for same-store sales.American Greetings shares rose 1.34 per cent to $23.44 after its posted a sharp increase in its third-quarter earnings. Best Buy gained 1.8 per cent to 49.21 after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 5.2 points, at 1,418.31 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.8 points lower at 2,415.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 42.6 points, at 12,421.25.In corporate news, Nike said after the close of the previous session that quarterly net profit rose nearly 8 per cent, beating Wall Street estimates. Nike shares were up 0.5 per cent at $100.29.The creditors’ committee at Delta Air Linesgave management of the firm an lukewarm vote of confidence, saying it supported the airline’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent carrier, but would continue to consider alternatives. Delta shares rose 5.7 per cent to $1.29. Rival US Airways Group has made a hostile $8.4bn bid for Delta.Juniper Networks, which makes routers used for internet and private computer networks, said it would incur a $900m charge for stock options granted between 1999 and 2003. In spite of this, its shares rose 0.8 per cent at $19.36.US regulators approved Invega, a longer-lasting version of Risperdal, Johnson & Johnson’s schizophrenia drug. But some analysts said they were concerned because the approval required a warning label about an increased risk of a potentially fatal heart side-effect. Shares in J&J fell 0.7 per cent to $66.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home goods retailer, fell 3.5 per cent to $38.54. It said after the close of the previous session that its quarterly profit rose 6 per cent, just below forecasts. Its shares dropped 4 per cent to $38.31.In deal news, Huntington Bancshares said late on Wednesday that it had agreed to buy another Ohio-based regional bank, Sky Financial Group, for $3.6bn in cash and stock. Huntington shares fell 7 per cent to $22.96 while Sky shares rose 14 per cent to $27.69.The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators edged up to 138.2 last month following a revised increase of 0.1 per cent to 138.1 in October.
711;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Ashley pitches for global field;;Mike Ashley finally showed his face to the world on Friday as the secretive founder of Sports World International broke cover to introduce himself to the City, declaring he wanted to make Sports World a global brand.The 42-year-old founder of Sports World said in a carefully scripted conference call that he needed more funds to fulfil his dream of making Sports World the biggest and most profitable sports retailer in the world, amid growing speculation the extremely private billionaire may float his business in the new year. “I think the business could be so, so much bigger and on a global stage,” he said.Mr Ashley, who hired Merrill Lynch to advise on his strategic options earlier this year, also said being a public company “would probably enable Sports World to get to where it can go. I would like to think I could make the grade [as a director of a public company].”Having eschewed the public gaze, for more than 15 years, Mr Ashley insisted that he was “not a recluse”. Asked why he hated the limelight, the entrepreneur, who on Friday released his first photo since his youth, joked: “See my picture and you will probably realise why.” On Friday the secretive tycoon released the first photograph of himself since his youth.He refused to confirm the value of his business, with estimates ranging anywhere between £1bn-£2.5bn.Mr Ashley did hint, however, that he planned an aggressive expansion of the Sports World brand into Europe. “We probably should have done it [international expansion] earlier,” he said. Sports World currently has stores in Ireland, Belgium and Slovenia.The retailer has enticed customers into his 380-strong chain of stores by undercutting competitors on premium Nike and Adidas products. He has also collected a stable of brands such as Slazenger, Donnay and Dunlop as well as buying Lillywhites store on Piccadilly Circus in London.Sports World profits rose 44 per cent to £74.4m in the year to April 24, 2005 on sales up 45 per cent to £905m. Mr Ashley declined to give further updates on Sports World’s more recent performance. “Christmas is cool,” is all he would say. adding that he would exceed his budget targets this year.Speculation has mounted round Mr Ashley and his business ventures since October when he bought a 29 per cent stake in Blacks Leisure, the outdoor sports group, raising suggestions he might seek to acquire the company.He declined to comment on this on Friday, saying only that he would make some decision on the future of his business in the New Year.Mr Ashley closed his first ever call with journalists, a short and sometimes nervous sounding performance, with: “Got to go. Mum wants me home.”
712;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-11-23T23:35:53Z;Adidas and Nike fuel retailer rivalry;;The bitter rivalry between the UK’s three big sportswear retailers is set to intensify as Adidas and Nike hold back premium ranges from heavy discounters to take their brands up-market.The manufacturers are concerned that the image of their products is being damaged by poor presentation in cheap stores.New rules on customer service and display quality will come into force in January and may benefit JJB Sports and JD Sports at the expense of Sports World, their discount rival.Gil Steyaert, managing director for Adidas in the UK, said: “It’s an industry that has been flat over the last four years.“We’re asking retailers to step up in terms of brand presentation and product presentation . . . They [Sports World] will look at [whether] they want to evolve their brand presentation to serve a higher part of the market.”JJB has been telling shareholders in the past few days that it will secure product lines that will not be carried at Sports World, the discount chain owned by Mike Ashley, who last month took a 29 per cent stake in Blacks Leisure, the outdoor sports group.“Both Adidas and Nike have new distribution policies that have been in place for some weeks but will come into effect from 2007,” said Tom Knight, chief executive of JJB.“There are certain presentational [requirements] in their policies. . . that would put them [Sports World] in a different category to us.”Mr Ashley is seen as a powerful force in retail, attracting admiration and hostility in equal measure for the way he displays and discounts goods.He has enjoyed success by enticing consumers with heavily-discounted premium Nike and Adidas products and selling his own brands such as Dunlop, Slazenger and Donnay.Other retailers have privately warned suppliers that they would stop stocking brands if they were also supplied to any of Mr Ashley’s companies amid concerns that his high sales densities and low prices undermine products.Tensions have been building since Mr Ashley broke ranks with rivals to blow the whistle on price-fixing of replica kits. He has subsequently taken stakes in JJB and JD, often building them stealthily, although the Blacks share-building is the most significant. His intentions for the stakes are unclear.
713;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-11-23T20:01:29Z;Adidas can’t tell British shoppers how to shop;;Cutting out discounters could well backfireAdidas and Nike’s efforts to restrict supply of their premium sports goods to discounters are part of a long and undistinguished history of brands with pretensions of grandeur trying to dictate what British customers buy and how they buy it. One way or another, the attempt is doomed to fail.There is no legal reason why individual brands should not cut discount chains such as Sports World out of their distribution network. Herbert Hainer, chief executive of Adidas, has called the UK “the toughest sporting goods market in Europe, if not the world” and it is his job to try to keep the German company’s margins up. This could be one way of doing so.But Adidas and its rival Nike are adopting the same haughty approach taken in recent years by the likes of Levi Strauss and Europe’s car manufacturers to determine how their goods are sold. They think the ambience and service at high-end retailers such as JD Sports are more suited to their high-tech shoes than the mass-market end of the shopping centre.Levi’s fought Tesco through the courts earlier this decade to prevent the supermarket importing its 501 jeans from European countries and selling them cheaply in the UK. That was successful – but demand for cheaper jeans was such that the outcome barely affected the retailer. Levi’s launched a range of jeans, aimed at discounters, less than a year after the final ruling. Car companies also use legal means – the European Union’s “block exemption” from normal competition rules – to protect their sales through franchised car dealers, with set standards of decor and service. EU moves to open that market may not have cut prices as much as Brussels hoped, but they have begun to shake up the showroom in the interests of customers.Of course, shoppers may decide they want to buy Nike and Adidas trainers in luxurious surroundings and pay luxury-brand prices. But eventually – as the Levi’s case proves – they tend to get the market they deserve. If British customers are happy with trainers sold in a way that is, in Mr Hainer’s words, “commoditised and lacking aspiration”, then so be it. The brands are free to decide whether to give those sales up, but they should have no illusions about their ability to change the buying habits of their customers.Tesco’s pioneer friendsTesco’s experience with Levi Strauss demonstrates how the relationship between customer and supplier changes when the client is dominant.The two sides are often said to be in a state of constant antagonism, with the supermarket squeezing the lowest price out of food producers. That is bound to have an element of truth – for every favoured supplier, there are several that are out of favour or feel hard done by – but there are plenty of reasons why Tesco and other supermarkets need to be friendly.One demonstration of this is Tesco’s decision to bring two of its favoured UK food suppliers with it when the supermarket opens its new neighbourhood stores in the western US next year. This is uncharted terrain for Tesco. Salads and cooked chickens – the areas in which the two UK suppliers specialise – are two of the mainstays of the prepared-meal market that Tesco is hoping to crack with its US project. It needs to get this element of its operation right.A second reason for forging closer relationships with suppliers is efficiency. As Wal-Mart and its biggest suppliers discovered when they set up “Wal-Mart teams” to handle the relationship in the late 1980s, sharing information and ideas can benefit both parties.Finally, earning a reputation for exploiting suppliers would be poor politics as well as poor business. At home, UK supermarkets face their third competition inquiry in six years. They are actively cultivating their network – witness J Sainsbury’s new system to speed cash to suppliers.In the US, Tesco must still fight through a thicket of local regulations to establish its foothold. Pioneers used to ring their wagons against the threat of attack. It would be no surprise if Tesco found more ways to bind itself closer to its trusted suppliers over the coming months.Careless whisperPoor Sean Pignatelli. The former salesman has been done by the Financial Services Authority for passing on tips that he didn’t think were inside information and that turned out to have been in the public domain all along. The analyst who dressed up his e-mail to sound sexier than it was, and the investors that traded the stock, escape censure.The FSA wants to clean up behaviour on the sales and trading floor and publicly castigating a careless salesman will certainly help.But, careless or not, Mr Pignatelli has a point when he says he just did not believe “that the CEO of a major company in 2005 is going to get a junior analyst . . . and give him some inside information . . . it’s just not going to happen”.

Already, shoppers have spent $6.35bn online (excluding travel) since the holiday season officially began on November 1, according to comScore Networks. That’s 23 per cent up on last year.
ComScore expects spending in November and December to exceed $24bn, 24 per cent higher than 2005, and Cyber Monday splurges to reach almost $600m, up from $484m last year.
However, there will be precious little to be made on the new PlayStation 3 due to shortages, although Sony points out a halo effect on the PSP – sales up 29 per cent week-on-week – and the PS2 – up 24 per cent.
Speaking of haloes, Microsoft says the game standing in for the long-awaited Halo 3 this season – Gears of War - has sold 1m copies in its first two weeks, undoubtedly beating Sony’s rival Resistance: Fall of Man, given the lack of PS3s.
Oh, and we may have finally established a link between the lines we observed for the PS3 and the queues outside Niketown here – Nike has come out with a limited edition PS3 sneaker.

Plenty of early prospectors soon packed their bags, dismissing Vietnam as an impoverished, war-scarred backwater too entrenched in Marxist ideology to provide a suitable business environment.Nike, however, stayed put, patiently turning the Communist-ruled country into an integral part of its global supply chain – the second-largest manufacturer of Nike-branded products after China. About 160,000 Vietnamese now work making Nike shoes and apparel – accounting for about 30 per cent of the US company’s global supply and around 9 per cent of Vietnam’s manufactured exports.With Hanoi poised to enter the World Trade Organisation, western and Asian companies are flocking back to Vietnam – many aiming to emulate Nike’s success in tapping the youthful workforce and burgeoning domestic market. Intel last week unveiled plans to build a $1bn semi-conductor assembly and testing facility in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest investment by a US company. And lawyers are receiving a flood of inquiries from business executives, all eager to hook into an economy growing around 8 per cent a year. Vietnam-dedicated funds are flush with newly-raised cash to invest in promising ventures.But as new companies, large and small, rush into what they hope will be a “little China”, Vietnam’s more seasoned, established investors are fretting over whether the already-strained infrastructure, sluggish government bureaucracy and skilled workforce will keep up with the stampede of investors, or whether
economic bottlenecks will generate fresh disillusionment.“It’s certainly not a perfect environment,” said Thomas O’Dore, chief representative of insurer Liberty Mutual and a veteran of the 1990s cycle of hype and letdown. “You have to come in with your eyes wide open and some patience.”Unlike their more ambivalent predecessors, Hanoi’s new generation of less-ideological, more market-savvy Communist rulers certainly sees foreign investors as important assets in the
drive to transform the country into a regional powerhouse, and to generate job opportunities for the approximately 1m young people entering the labour force every year.Yet the lingering legacy of the centrally-planned economy, decades of rule by fiat and pervasive corruption have left the government with formidable challenges in trying to meet investors’ requirements: modern infrastructure; predictable, transparent and timely bureaucratic decision-making; and a credible legal and regulatory system.Port congestion, power shortages and other infrastructure deficiencies are already big investor headaches, even before the anticipated post-WTO surge of exports, which some business groups forecast will grow 25 per cent a year for the next several years.Ports around the greater Ho Chi Minh City region – which accounts for around 73 per cent of Vietnam’s total exports – are already at full capacity. Blackouts are not uncommon.While Hanoi has set out plans for both port and power expansion, manufacturers and business groups warn that cautious Vietnamese authorities are under-estimating future growth – and that the inevitable delays in getting projects off the ground will bring a crunch soon.“It is not China, where they build in advance. Vietnam has really built infrastructure in a ‘just-in-time’ model,” said Chris Helzer, a senior regional executive for Nike. “That is how they have done it, and it’s always worked for them . . . But with this 25 per cent annual expected export growth, that approach is going to need to evolve.”The nature of Vietnam’s port plans has also generated concern. Rather than building a handful of large-scale, world class ports in several strategic locations along the country’s long coastline, Hanoi, preoccupied with distributing the benefits of growth equally, wants to build smaller ports, one in every province. “They are very socialist, very 1960s in their thinking,” said
one logistics expert, who predicts serious port congestion for the next four years, at least.Investors may encounter other unexpected difficulties. Competition to find and retain skilled workers – even managers and executives – will intensify. Companies aiming to sell their products in the local market will find high-quality counterfeits – many imported from China – are rampant and authorities have insufficient resources to eradicate the fakes. Smaller companies, without a highly-recognisable name, may contend with low-level bureaucrats, who may not share their superiors’ commitment to wooing as much investment as they can.Yet chastened by their past failed flirtation with this emerging market, many western companies this time around are far more realistic. And Mr O’Dore predicts Hanoi will also make strenuous efforts to try to remain the darling of investors, as it seems to be now. “There’s going to be growing pains,” he said. “But when the pressure is at its highest, Vietnam will come through.”"

717;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-11-16T13:52:56Z;Lines blur between public and privates companies;;Discussions about environmental stewardship and community development were once heard in the offices of multilateral institutions, development banks and non-profit organisations. Today, as the private sector embraces corporate responsibility, many jobs resemble those once only seen public or voluntary organisations – providing stiff competition for those organisations when it comes to recruitment.Take Cisco Systems. As vice-president of corporate affairs at the company, Tae Yoo heads a team responsible for creating partnerships with local and global organisations to promote change in such areas as education, basic needs and economic development – a job description that looks very similar to that of someone working in a United Nations agency or a non-governmental organisation (NGO).Much of the activities that go on at Nike, too, are focused on development and sustainability. As a result, the work of its executives ranges from managing labour conditions in clothing and shoe factories to involvement in initiatives such ninemillion.org, a project launched by the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, in which Nike, along with companies such as Microsoft, supports efforts to bring education and sports to young people in refugee camps.“You’ve got greater opportunities than ever before for people who have been in the public sector to move into positions in corporations,” says Alan Marks, a senior spokesperson for Nike.Mr Marks cites the work of Sarah Severn, Nike’s director of sustainable development, whose job is to examine trends ranging from the depletion of global oil reserves to developments in sustainable design. Ms Severn is also responsible for identifying long-term opportunities and risks in such areas as the environment and traditionally excluded populations – issues that were once the concern only of governments and NGOs.“She’s trying to look five or even 10 years out at emerging issues in the NGO world and issues that will be of importance to the company,” says Mr Marks. “She’s been with Nike for a number of years, so she is not someone who came out of the public sector – but the kind of work she’s doing is very much in line with public sector work.”While executives such as Ms Yoo and Ms Severn come from corporate backgrounds, the drive to embrace corporate responsibility has prompted companies to start persuading public and non-profit sector employees to move across to the for-profit world.At Unilever, for example, Santiago Gowland started two NGOs in Argentina – one focusing on handicapped children, the other on microfinance – before joining the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group as its director of corporate responsibility.Microsoft, too, has recruited staff from the non-profit and public sector, hiring people from development banks, development agencies and large foundations. Pamela Passman, Microsoft’s vice-president of global corporate affairs, says these executives bring with them valuable skills as well as insights into the public and voluntary sectors. “We learn a lot from them about the language, how priorities are set and how to make things happen in these organisations,” she says.“With the increasing emphasis on the management of corporate responsibility and risks and reporting those areas, there’s been a significant increase of recruitment in the private sector of people who have been in the voluntary sector,” says Robert Davies, chief executive of the International Business Leaders Forum, which works with corporations to promote responsible business practices.Moreover, he adds, pension fund and institutional investors now require analysts capable of focusing on the social aspects of a business, such as human rights, labour standards and the environment. “And almost none of that existed five years ago,” says Mr Davies.As the lines blur between the activities of the public and private sectors, executives who have worked in a variety of organisations– whether governmental, voluntary or multilateral –are becoming highly sought after.“There’s a greater premium placed on high level individuals with cross-sectoral experience,” says Bennett Freeman, senior vice-president for social research and policy at the Calvert Group, the US family of socially responsible mutual funds. “Ten years ago, there weren’t too many people with those kind of credentials and now that is the way of the future.”For the global public sector, the trend is clear: stiff competition is emerging when it comes to recruiting top talent to work in areas such as development and sustainability. Moreover, while big institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund can offer attractive packages to staff, smaller non-profit groups and non-governmental organisations struggle to compete with private sector salaries.“It’s a much more competitive market for the big public institutions and development agencies,” says Mr Freeman, who in the late 1990s worked in government as US deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour.“These organisations no longer have a corner on the market for the best jobs and the greatest responsibilities.”
718;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-11-09T08:59:19Z;Adidas warns as Reebok struggles;;Adidas, the German sporting goods maker, on Thursday cut its profit outlook for 2007 as it steps up investment in its struggling Reebok brand, sending its shares down nearly 8 per cent in early Frankfurt tradingThe company said net income was likely to grow by 15 per cent in 2007, down from earlier forecasts of 20 per cent growth.The move comes as the sporting goods maker tries to turn around Reebok, which it bought in August 2005 for €3.1bn.The brand, which was popular in the 1980s, fell out of fashion after failing to adapt quickly enough to changes in consumer tastes.Adidas warned in March that sales of Reebok would be weak this year. The troubled brand has lost nearly 50 per cent of its market share position in the US and about 40 per cent of its share in the UK, according to analysts at Denmark’s Jyske Bank.Adidas said on Thursday that Reebok sales for the first 11 months of the year were expected to have fallen at “mid-single digit rates.”The German sportswear maker plans to strengthen the Reebok brand in emerging markets and said it would increase investment in advertising, new media, point-of-sale communication and product development.The group on Thursday reported a 12 per cent increase in net income for the first nine months of 2006 to €483m. In the third quarter, net income rose 20 per cent to €249m.The Adidas brand has been performing well, taking market share from Nike in some western European markets, according to analysts. The company said it expected sales of the brand to grow in the “low double digits” in 2006.However, the group’s profit margins have slipped, falling 2.6 per cent to 10.6 per cent of sales over the nine months, as it consolidates the Reebok acquisition.Reebok has a “significantly lower operating margin” than the group average, Adidas said. Margins fell 2.5 percentage points in the third quarter to 13.9 per cent.Adidas shares were €3.04 lower at €37.96 in early Frankfurt training.
719;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-10-23T22:40:02Z;Former Nike chief takes helm at Wrigley;;Wrigley, the world’s largest maker of chewing gum, on Monday surprised investors when it appointed an outsider to run the company for the first time.William Perez, the former chief executive of Nike, will become president and CEO, replacing Bill Wrigley Jr, who remains chairman of the board.Monday’s news sent Wrigley’s shares up more than 14 per cent to $53.58, reversing a year-long slide.Mr Wrigley Jr, the 43-year-old great-grandson of the founder, assumes the new role of executive chairman and will be responsible for innovation and developing a long-term strategy. He said the changes were “an historic and important milestone” for the company.“Bill [Perez] is an exceptionally talented and well-qualified executive who honed his leadership skills in a highly successful, professionally managed, family company environment,” he said. “He is a terrific fit …and has an impressive track record of building global brands, leading consumer-driven innovation and inspiring employees.”Mr Perez, 59, has practical knowledge of family businesses. He spent 34 years with SC Johnson, including eight years as president and chief executive of the privately-held company.In December 2004 he joined Nike, where he was president and CEO until January of this year, when he resigned after clashing with Philip Knight, the company’s founder and chairman.Mr Perez brings to Wrigley hands-on experience of marketing consumer products and a history of managing well-known brands.The management transition comes at a time when the performance of Wrigley’s shares has been disappointing.It has had a tough time integrating brands acquired last year from Kraft Foods and faces competition from rival Cadbury Schweppes, the UK-based confectioner.Wrigley is losing market share to new gum products such as Trident Splash and Dentyne Soft Chew, from Cadbury’s Adams unit.Under Mr Wrigley, the company realised that it had to diversify into chocolate, sweets and lollipops. Last year it acquired Altoids mints and Life Savers sweets from Kraft but investors have questioned the move.In April Wrigley said the deal would be “slightly dilutive” until the end of this fiscal year – a reversal from June last year when they were to be “slightly accretive in 2006”.Meanwhile, Wrigley said on Monday that third quarter profit had risen by a better-than-expected 14 per cent, while sales increased 11 per cent to $1.18bn.Separately, Kellogg, the cereal maker, said on Monday David Mackay, president and chief operating officer, would become chief executive as of December 31, replacing Jim Jenness, who will continue as chairman.
720;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-10-23T19:42:51Z;Wrigley;;Inheriting a family fiefdom has its challenges. Take chewing gum maker Wrigley, which has been distinctively conservative for much of its 115-year history. Not so since 1999, when Bill Wrigley Jr took over as chief executive after his father’s death.That makes Monday’s decision to hire William Perez – formerly at Nike – all the more remarkable. The 14 per cent jump in the company’s share price partly reflects solid results for the third quarter and probably some short-covering. Still, no longer keeping the top job in the family makes sense.Mr Wrigley, who will stay on as executive chairman, can claim quite a bit of credit for the continuing success of Wrigley’s chewing gum business in recent years. But especially after last year’s mint and candy acquisition of Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft, there were signs that Mr Wrigley’s intimate day-to-day involvement in business minutiae slowed down decision-making.The company’s record in new product launches has been patchy. At a time when Cadbury Schweppes, its main chewing gum rival, appears to be gaining market share and stepping up pricing and innovation pressures, Wrigley has appeared remarkably complacent. That has taken a heavy toll on its shares, even though their current rating of 25 times next year’s earnings only looks cheap by the company’s own historic standards.The trouble is that tapping an outsider can only get you so far. As Ford has just shown, it offers a chance to push a string of “one-off” nasties down the kitchen sink and sends a signal that change might be in the offing. That change, though, still has to be delivered. And while Wrigley’s core gum business enjoys excellent long-term prospects, Mr Wrigley has never made a secret of his desire to add other confectionery items. Ominously, his new role will see him focus on “growth strategy”.
721;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
722;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-10-18T10:35:26Z;CIO as communicator: Way with words now a vital skill;;As chief information officers becomes more integral to businesses, they not only have to learn about their company’s strategy, but be able to articulate it as well.In the 1980s, IT bosses were still familiar with the smell of the soldering iron. Today, they need soft skills and a way with words.Ken Harris, CIO of Shaklee, a Californian company producing natural nutrition, skincare and vitamin products with a turnover of $500m, has worked for Gap, Nike and PepsiCo.He has recently implemented customer relationship management (CRM) software from RightNow technologies at Shaklee. RightNow is one of a growing number of suppliers that allows users to operate software as a dial-up service, subscribing to the system by usage and leaving the actual running and operation to the original vendor.“My role has morphed into that of a communicator over the past 25 years, ” says Mr Harris. “When we decided to use the RightNow software, we got the senior business people together and said to them ‘Here is a tool and anyone can use it’. The whole discussion that followed was about our business and where it is going.”Mr Harris notes that an effective CIO communicates with multiple constituencies, including his suppliers.He talks of “vendor management”, the art of keeping a dialogue with different vendors open, as a skill he has acquired. “And you have to be able to let people see that a new idea will make their life easier, so your job involves more and more internal salesmanship.”Nigel Underwood was CIO at logistics group Excel, and now holds the same job at DHL Logistics. Managing IT after an acquisition is about making staff realise integration is about people and their expectations, he says.His first concern was that IT staff should feel part of a structure instead of thinking that their world had been taken over and they had lost control.“You start with the internal audience, you open lines of communication for feedback. It is not just about soft communication skills, but about how you plan ahead and manage the deployment of those skills.”Mr Underwood, a mathematics graduate, summarises his work as “99 per cent ‘I for Information’ and only 1 per cent ‘T for technology’. I try not to talk in acronyms, and I remember that communication is a two-way process. My role is to educate and coach.”He uses his membership of The Infrastructure Forum (TIF), a professional body for European IT directors, to compare notes with contemporaries.“We have learned to position ourselves so we get an insight into the whole business remit.”Organisations like this can help top up skills developed via media training aimed at teaching the CIO to explain his work to readers of non-technical publications.But the divide between the CIO and his fellow board members still exists, according to business adviser, Accenture.California-based Accenture partner Gary Curtis works with clients evaluating the IT implications of mergers. He says formal training can make a big difference to the way the CIO is perceived by his colleagues and a broader audience.“Look at the kind of coaching a chief executive gets. There is a lot of ongoing public relations training. But it is still rare to see that at the CIO level.”Recruiting CIOs with a background in anything other than technology and a track record in clear communication is one option.However, given the scarcity of such individuals, Mr Curtis suggests being realistic: “They may learn about communications along the way, but if not, they should be trying to go out and acquire world-class business communications skills.”He concedes that only a very small proportion of CIOs fit this bill, but at least they constitute “a growing faction”.If nothing else, as the role of IT shifts within companies, the CIO needs to be a good communicatior, if only to explain why this job still matters so much.
723;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-10-11T21:01:53Z;Puma aims to triple number of stores;;Puma, the German sporting goods company, on Wednesday set an ambitious target of tripling the number of retail stores worldwide and in the US by 2010.The “sports lifestyle” brand has in recent years diversified its wholesale business into retail, and has more than 80 stores worldwide.Puma has 40 stores in the US, a market dominated by larger rival Nike with its range of $100-plus sneakers endorsed by basketball superstars. Puma plans to open another five stores in the US this year.“Retail is important for giving us the figures we need to know from the industry, such as sell-through, which you don’t know in wholesale. And to limit our risk,” Michael Specht, Puma’s global head of retail, told the FT.“We have some key accounts in the US and the rest of the world but to really limit the risk for our brand we have to have our own stores, which we can control. We can control which direction we go in.”Mr Specht said there were still “many spots to go” to in the US and Canada.While Puma popularised the fashion style know variously as the low-profile, fusion, or lifestyle look, its roots are in sport. The world’s third-largest sporting goods group invested heavily in the recent football World Cup – in which it sponsored the champions, Italy – and has entered new categories such as golf, swimming, women’s clothing and motorsport.“Global sporting events are key, but the major growth comes from our own creativity and the increasing of our collections,” said Antonio Bertone, group functional director brand and marketing for Puma.“The fact there is no major world sporting event [in 2007] doesn’t really drive a lot of our growth needs. Our job is to seasonally come out with a collection that was better than last season.”In August, Puma increased its mid-term sales target by €500m to €4bn ($5bn).Additional reporting by Richard Milne
724;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-09-25T17:12:20Z;Basketball dreams on a budget;;"When Stephon Marbury steps on to the basketball court for the New York Knicks in their opening pre-season game this October, at least some of the focus will be not on his playing, but on his shoes.Marbury, the fifth highest paid player in the National Basketball Association last season, has announced that this season he’ll be playing not in Nike’s Air Jordans, which sell for about $175, nor in Reebok’s Iverson Answer IXs which sell for $124.99, but in his own brand, Starbury One shoes – now on sale for just $14.98 (before tax).Marbury’s cheaper sports shoes are the centrepiece of an unusual sports marketing alliance in which an athlete who was paid $16.5m last season is stressing not ultra-high performance, but affordability.“You are giving a kid the opportunity to go and buy a pair of shoes, now he can buy it on his own... instead of his mother being responsible for something like that and having to spend $150,” says Mr Marbury in a video promoting the shoes running in the Manhattan branch of Steve & Barry’s, a low-cost sportswear chain.The Starbury One is among a range of 50 Starbury products on sale at Steve & Barry’s University Sportswear, which built its name on low prices. After the Starbury shoes, the next most expensive item currently on sale in its cavernous stores is a down jacket selling for $9.98, with hooded sweatshirts and pants priced at $7.98.“We run our business very tightly and efficiently,” says Barry Prevor, the retailer’s 43-year old chairman and co-founder. “There’s no extra costs anywhere.”Mr Prevor and his co-founder Steve Shore opened their first store when they were college students at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Taken aback by the high prices charged for college-branded clothing at the campus store, they set up a rival operation, going on to assemble a stack of clothing licences that now include 350 colleges as well as brands such as Ford, General Motors and Hershey.The retailer opened its first shopping mall store in Detroit in 1998. It now operates 144 stores of 70,000 sq ft and expects to have 200 by the end of the year.Mr Prevor says it is largely a coincidence that the Starbury shoe and the retailer’s launch of its first exclusive brand – which has attracted nationwide publicity – has come along as the retailer is making the transition from a regional chain, centred in the northeast, to a national operation.Instead, he says the idea of the low-cost Starbury range came about a year ago from Marbury’s agency, The Agency Sports Management, with whom they had worked on other licensing agreements.“It wasn’t necessarily a strategic thought to say ‘let’s go get an athlete relationship and get into this business,’ ” says Howard Shacter, who manages Steve & Barry’s licensing partnerships. “Like so many things that happen in an entrepreneurial company like ours, when an idea feels right in the gut, and it so closely matches what your brand is all about, then you go for it.”But the retailer has displayed a distinctly strategic approach to exploiting its potential – the shoes were designed by Rocketfish Design Studio, a firm founded by two former Nike shoe designers. The marketing of the project has been handled by The Mastermind Group, a marketing firm set up by Erin Patton, who in the 1990s was the first brand manager of Nike’s hugely successful Air Jordan line.Athletes have endorsed lower cost shoes before. The Starter Pro line, made by Nike and sold at Wal-Mart for around $40, is backed by Brett Favre, quarterback of the Green Bay Packers. In 2004, Payless, the largest US bargain shoe retail chain, launched the sports shoes endorsed by Shaquille O’Neal of the Miami Heat, also for less than $40.But the Marbury deal has involved an unusual level of involvement by the athlete, not only with in-store appearances and other promotions, but in establishing the street credibility of a low-cost shoe with a status- and brand-conscious urban audience. The basketball star even went on a promotional tour in the month before the start of the
season.“I’ve worked with athletes most of my career, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” says Mr Schacter.Mr Patton’s team began the marketing push over the summer, initially using basketball magazines and websites to put out the message that Marbury was involved in a shoe deal, and then getting high-school basketball athletes to try out the new shoes, without mentioning the price.To back up the message of what he calls “authenticity”, the marketing team shot the video of Mr Marbury visiting his old haunts in Coney Island, talking to people on the street and playing ball at a local club with old friends.“We wanted to ground the brand... creating his vision of growing up in a urban environment where it was difficult for his mother and other parents to keep pace with the exorbitant price of the shoes,” says Mr Patton.Unlike most other sports deals, including Mr Marbury’s previous endorsement deal with American Sporting Goods’ And1 basketball shoes, the arrangement involves no up-front payment: Mr Marbury receives a share of the revenues based on performance – reinforcing his involvement in the project.The retailer says demand for the shoes has exceeded its expectations. “Every pair we put out is sold the same day it gets to the shelf,” says Mr Shacter.It plans to follow up with more own-brand merchandise and by expanding into broader ranges of clothing. As Steve & Barry’s continues its rapid expansion, funded so far by its bank loans and revenues, Mr Prevor says the firm is now discussing financing options that “would allow us to take the concept beyond a few hundred stores, and into the many thousands”.Knicks fans will be hoping that the value-for-the-money strategy will help Mr Marbury’s on-court performance with their troubled team – which last season finshed bottom of its division, despite Mr Marbury’s personal contribution to making their team overall the highest-paid in the NBA.HOW LOW CAN PRICES GO?Steve & Barry’s alliance with Stephon Marbury has presented the Starbury Shoe as a socially concerned product – seeking to break the grip of the top name sports shoe brands on urban and black American culture.But critics ask whether a shoe that costs $14.98 can be produced without the kind of labour rights abuses – such as unpaid overtime – that are widespread in the global clothing and footwear supply chains.“There is a price for a product below which you can’t produce without violating the rights of the workers in the factory that makes it,” says Scott Nova, of the Workers Rights Consortium, a group backed by US colleges whose work includes investigating workplace complaints.Barry Prevor says the price Steve & Barry’s pays sub-contracting factories, through its global sourcing affiliate 4004 Incorporated, “is fair and it is normal... I don’t know that we’re really paying any less than anyone else”. He also says that it is “a core principle that all our merchandise has to be purchased from manufacturers that are socially compliant”.US college licence conditions require the retailer to be members of the Fair Labor Association, an anti-sweat shop industry initiative. But the retailer’s comparatively small size means it is not subject to the same demands as Nike, Adidas and other large companies, and FLA standards would not apply to its other branded clothing, or to production of the Starbury sneakers.Mr Nova says Steve & Barry’s has a “mixed” record on its response to two investigations by the WRC of conditions at factories in Kenya. The company “needs to demonstrate” that it is taking steps to deal with the problems endemic in garment and shoe factories in China and elswhere. “If there’s a social component for the consumer, then there should be a social component at the production end too,” he says."
725;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-08-31T18:57:42Z;Media money will flow to content managers;;To catch a glimpse of where media industry profits are headed, look no further than Heavy.com. There, advertisers such as Sony, Nike, Axe and Diesel have settled in to reach the coveted 18- to 34-year-old males – more than 10m unique users each month. The seven-year-old site, which calls itself a “broadband network”, lets users swap videos and games and also offers its own guy-oriented content that is significantly less expensive to create than what is broadcast by traditional networks. Heavy.com’s expected 2006 advertising revenues of $20m represent a 300 per cent increase over 2005.Heavy.com is a beneficiary of the media profit pool’s shifting tides. During the past two decades, broadcasters, station groups, cable television operators and other distributors garnered most of the profits in media because they controlled access to the consumer. Now, thanks to an explosion of content and new delivery platforms, control has shifted to consumers of media. As a result, the money made by managing content will grow faster than profits in any other part of the media value chain. Profits from content management, boosted by the “aggregation” of content and communities by popular internet portals and cable network brands, are rising about 12 per cent a year, according to our analysis. That is roughly twice the rate of growth in profits from distribution.Traditional industry players are spending billions on content management. But it will take more than the right investments to win these sweepstakes. To succeed as content managers, media companies need to know more about their customers than the customers know about themselves. They must anticipate customers’ changing preferences and rapidly turn those insights into new offerings.Skilful content management requires making the right calls about what content gets targeted at which audiences, which platforms to use in transmitting that content and how best to support it through advertising, subscriptions or a combination of the two.What will it take to win? First, media companies need to be disciplined about where not to invest. While it makes sense for content creators and distributors to carve out as large a stake of the profits from content aggregation as they can, neither should try to play all three links in the chain as creators, managers and distributors. Distributors and creators should focus on the content management that sits between distribution and content creation. Distributors should buy the content that will generate the highest return on investment from their customer base. Creators should sell their products through whatever combination of platforms generates the most revenue.Second, media companies should identify which audiences to pursue first and develop strategies to “own” those segments wherever the audience tunes in. ESPN, the US-based sports network, is a textbook case: from a single cable channel, ESPN has expanded to multiple channels, a print magazine, a high-traffic website and now content pushed to mobile phones.Third, companies need to determine where they have significant gaps. Can a cable network capture and immediately process user data? That is what enables Google to deliver targeted advertising and Amazon to offer instant product recommendations. Where is the forum for audiences to share user-generated content and opinions, as they do on YouTube and MySpace. Such forums keep audiences returning and build libraries of content that help to lower programming costs.Finally, companies must build a strong consumer focus. The key is capturing the right customer information and quickly incorporating these insights into product development and content management. Time Warner Cable, for example, intends to create an auction system for advertising spots, matching subscriber data culled from set-top boxes with information about what subscribers prefer to watch. Advertisers will bid to target ads at viewers with specific viewing habits.

726;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Sole man wins board approval;;Most chief executives of large branded goods companies come to the job after a spell in marketing and a high-flying MBA. For Pierre André Senizergues, the route to the top involved more than 10 years of double ollieflips and handstand kickflips.The former professional skateboarder founded Sole Technology, the world’s biggest privately owned action sports footwear and apparel company. From its beginnings in 1986, Mr Senizergues has built a $200m company with seven brands, including Etnies, with its trademark upside-down “E”, and ThirtyTwo, a line of snowboarding boots.Etnies has built a reputation as the footwear of choice for skateboarders by focusing on comfort and durability while retaining its core image. “In this market you have to be authentic, you have to come from skateboarding,” Mr Senizergues says.Sole has also branched out into other action sports such as snowboarding, surfing, BMX and Moto-X.Mr Senizergues’s experience shows the importance for entrepreneurs seeking to build a “cult” brand of keeping a first-hand connection with the target market. It also shows how smart marketing and product development can help a niche product grow.Like other, smaller shoe and apparel companies, Sole is up against big competitors, including DC Shoes, Vans and industry heavyweight Nike. “You have to find a niche, something that people need,” says the 43-year-old Mr Senizergues (pronounced Sin-e-zerg). “But you also have to be passionate about it because it will take a lot of you to make it happen.”It all started with a shoe brand called Etnics. In 1986, French company Rautureau Apple, in collaboration with French skateboarder Alain “Platoon” Montagnet, launched the line of durable shoes for the European skate and surf markets (the name changed to Etnies later).In 1988, Mr Senizergues, then a 25-year-old professional skateboarder, signed on to ride for the brand and that year designed the Senix pro-model shoe, marking his first foray into the footwear business.In 1989, back problems forced Mr Senizergues to seek a new line of work: he convinced Etnies that it could break into the US only by having a local office. He negotiated a licence to start distributing Etnies in the US even though he had no experience with sales or importing. He had graduated in France with a degree in electrotechnic and industrial software and worked briefly for IBM France.“I had no experience and knew nothing about how to run a business,” he says. He used his savings and $250,000 in vendor financing to set up. Later he signed a licensing deal with Etnies and formed Etnies USA, the first skateboarding shoe distribution company owned and managed by a professional skateboarder.The first five years were a slog. “The US economy was extremely challenging and a lot of skate shops were closed or weren’t willing to take new brands,” Mr Senizergues says.Not only did he have to learn about the market and how to warehouse and distribute shoes, but there was also the language hurdle: “Coming from Europe and not speaking much English and launching in the US was very challenging,” he says. He practised by starting conversations with people he met out skateboarding.Mr Senizergues noticed skaters were buying high-top shoes – covering the ankles – but wanted low-top styles. So he began designing shoes from a skater’s point of view. “Kids were buying low-top shoes that weren’t skate shoes and were going through them in two hours,” he says. “Ours had the look and the performance component, as it had an [outer sole] that would last four times longer.”The year 1994 was a turning point: “The economy rebounded, there were new skate shops opening and willing to take brands and the shoe design was right on point with what the kids wanted.”Sales jumped from $1m in 1993 to $6m in 1994 and $10m in 1995. But the sudden spurt created growing pains: 1994 was “chaos”, Mr Senizergues says. “I was in a vacuum not knowing how big the market was and trying to plan to match the demand. We kept having to move to bigger warehouses to keep up.”He also learnt another important business lesson: “You have to hire the right people. That sounds very obvious, but when you hire fast you hire whoever you can. You have to hire people with experience who also understand your vision and have the same values.” The company has more than 400 employees, and the average age is 28.By 1996 Mr Senizergues was designing Etnies in the US and had worldwide distribution. The next step was to buy the Etnies brand, which he did for about $1m, using his own money and company cash. The Etnies, éS, Emerica and ThirtyTwo brands were incorporated under the Sole Technology umbrella.On average, the company has had double digit sales growth since 1993. The most important skill for managing the business during rapid growth, he says, is the ability to change and still stay focused.With this in mind, the company built the Sole Technology Institute, which it says is the world’s first and only skateboarding-focused biomechanics research facility. The force on the foot during skateboarding can be as much as 17 times the rider’s body weight. “Skate shoes have to be safe with absorbing the impact and also have to be very durable,” says Mr Senizergues. They must also be flexible so the rider can feel the board.Sole’s brands are sold in more than 70 countries, in small skate shops and retail chains specialising in action sports. Its leading markets are the US, Canada and the UK, with 85 per cent of sales coming from shoes and 15 per cent from clothing.Clever marketing has been vital. The company sponsors more than 100 athletes around the world and assembles teams of skaters, surfers, snowboarders and BMX and motocross riders to promote the brands.Over the years there have been rumours Nike might be interested in buying Sole. But Mr Senizergues says he has no intention of selling or going public. “There is no reason to sell because we are self-funded and it works. It would change the culture of the company. Everyone really enjoys what they are doing. We do our own things and we are having fun.”Other feet in the marketTwo other high-growth companies are creating a buzz in footwear – Crocs and Under Armour. Like Sole, they also compete against companies that are bigger and wield greater buying power, such as Nike and Adidas.In June, Under Armour, best known for its moisture-wicking “compression apparel”, dipped its toes into the $19bn US athletic footwear business when it launched a line of American football boots. This month it joined Nike and Reebok as an official supplier of footwear to the US National Football League.Sales at Under Armour, which went public in November, reached $281m last year. The company was set up when Kevin Plank, chief executive, tired of damp cotton T-shirts and decided to create a lightweight shirt for fellow football players.While Under Armour focuses on sportswear, Crocs’s innovative resin clogs are designed for casual comfort and the outdoors. They are one of the hottest shoes this year.Crocs was launched in 2002 when one of the three founders bought a pair of clogs and thought the design, with holes for air and drainage, would make a perfect boating shoe. On a trip in the Caribbean, he showed it to two friends and they decided to market the shoe, developed and manufactured by Foam Creations.Crocs went public in February and analysts expect revenue to double this year to $205m.
727;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-08-11T18:17:01Z;Juventus requires some nimble footwork;;The financial future of Juventus will depend not on its skill on the field but on the Italian football club’s skill at renegotiating multi-million euro commercial partnerships and any premiums it can wrest from selling its top players.The club also warned that the current disciplinary proceedings against the club for match fixing would “produce negative economic effects” in the coming year but that it is unable to quantify the risk.Juventus, relegated to Serie B second division last month and stripped of its last two league titles after being found guilty of influencing the outcome of matches, stands to lose tens of millions of euros as sponsors such as Tamoil and Nike renegotiate their contracts and media companies review what they pay for broadcasting rights. The club will also lose an estimated €22m ($28m) from its European Champions League exclusion.The first signs of Juventus’ financial worries were evident on Friday as it reported a 36 per cent drop in quarterly revenues, largely attributable to the club’s lost championship bonus.Revenues in the fourth quarter of the 2005/06 fiscal year, which ended June 30, were €40.3m, down from €62.9m a year earlier. The club’s net loss for the full year deepened to €21m from a loss of €3m the year before, despite a 9.7 per cent increase in revenues to €251.5m, boosted by €44.2m in one-off media deals.Writedowns of €13.1m also weighed on the bottom line as Juventus forward booked losses on the sales of players Lilian Thuram and Patrick Vieira, although they were sold after the end of the fiscal year.The company’s financial report also noted that “many players have asked to be transferred to other clubs”. But selling players could also be the club’s salvation. On Thursday, the club booked a €15m profit on the €24.8m sale of striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Juventus has also made profits on the recent transfers of Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluca Zambrotta and Adrian Mutu.Juventus has filed a second appeal with Italy’s Olympic committee in hopes that it can reverse or lighten the sentence handed down last month by the football federation. Besides being relegated from the premier league and stripped of two titles, Juventus was also docked 17 points in the upcoming season, making it unlikely that Juventus would return to Serie A the year after. The decision is expected on August 18.The club’s stock closed up 1.8 per cent at €1.90 per share.Remarkably, the market capitalisation of Juventus has increased significantly since it was retrograded to Serie B, reaching €230m on Friday compared with €160m at the beginning of the year.“Juventus has a valuable brand around the world, on the same level as Ferrari. Those who are buying shares now are counting on more interesting income in the future,” Roberto Lottici, a fund manager at Banca Ifigest, told Bloomberg.But some believe traders are betting on a delisting of Juventus. Officials from Italy’s sports ministry have recently signalled that they would like to see Italian football club shares off the Milan stock exchange.
728;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-08-09T18:09:44Z;Adidas reaps rewards from World Cup;;Adidas-sponsored France may have lost to Puma’s Italy in the World Cup final, but the sporting goods company famed for its three stripes showed its strength off the pitch on Wednesday, unveiling a better-than-expected second quarter performance.The World Cup in Germany gave Adidas and Puma home advantage and was viewed by many investors as an investment for the future – a way for companies to raise revenues and profile but at the expense of lower profits due to the billions spent on marketing.Of the big kit-makers, including Nike and Puma, Adidas is seen as having had the best World Cup. It confirmed that view with sales up 20 per cent to €1.8bn ($2.3bn) on a like-for-like basis – or up 60 per cent to €2.4bn including its takeover of Reebok.But, following Puma’s net profit decline of 15 per cent last week, profits at Adidas slipped 11 per cent to €83m.The Reebok acquisition was designed to beef up Adidas’ presence in the US where the German group has long lagged Nike.But sales growth in the US in the second quarter disappointed some analysts and the combined group has lost market share against Nike in each of the last three years. Adidas spent an estimated €200m ensuring its brand name was omnipresent at the World Cup – from the shirts of teams such as Germany and Argentina to pitchside adverts and even a replica stadium near the Reichstag in Berlin.It expects football sales to reach at least €1.2bn this year with 3m team shirts and 15m footballs sold as it strives to stay number one in the sport ahead of Nike, which has made an aggressive push in the last decade but struggled at the World Cup.Adidas managed to beat second quarter expectations by slashing its marketing budget on everything except the World Cup, so that overall costs rose far less than expected.Concern at the world’s second-largest sporting goods company still centres on its $3.8bn acquisition of struggling Reebok. Reebok’s order backlog – an indicator of future sales – was down 13 per cent in currency-neutral terms, only one percentage point better than the previous quarter.But Andreas Inderst, analyst at ABN Amro, pointed out that the sponsorship for the NBA basketball league in the US passed from Reebok to Adidas during the quarter, worsening the results.Adidas expects a full-year sales decline at Reebok in the mid-single digits but has also said the brand’s new positioning will not become fully apparent until the 2008 spring-summer collection.
729;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Nike founder in $105m pledge to Stanford;;Philip Knight, founder and chairman of Nike, has pledged $105m to Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business - the largest donation in the school’s history and believed to be the largest given to a business school.The bulk of the gift - $100m - will be used to build a new $275m campus for the Mr Knight’s alma mater, to be named the Knight Management Center. The school plans to break ground on the new management center in 2008. The remaining $5m of the gift will be used to match other donors’ gifts for faculty endowment.Robert Joss, dean of the business school, said the new centre will include a 450-seat auditorium, breakout study rooms as well as more flexible classroom space for the greater number of small seminars the school will offer. “This will provide the physical infrastructure for the academic vision we have for ourselves,” he said.Over the years Mr Knight, who founded the $22bn athletic gear company in 1964, has given millions of dollars to Stanford, including money for the construction of the business school’s Knight Building in 1999, and gifts to the athletic department.The iconic Nike swoosh will not adorn the new building. “Phil has been a great supporter of Stanford, and he is modest,” said Mr Joss. “It’s not Nike, it’s Phil Knight.”Business schools are increasingly the recipients of multimillion-dollar gifts. Last year, there were three gifts between $36m and $50m given to university business schools last year. According to Giving USA, a report published by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.In 2004, Stephen Ross, the New York City real estate developer, gave $100m to the University of Michigan’s business school which was subsequently renamed the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. In 2000, San Antonio businessman Red McCombs donated $50m to the University of Texas’ business school, which was also then named after him.“The gifts are certainly getting bigger,” said Rae Goldsmith, vice-president at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, a fund-raising association in Washington. “This reflects how educational institutions are getting more sophisticated about working with major donors and actively soliciting big gift.”“The costs of higher education are going up – just like industry. These institutions are heavily technology and human resource oriented, they need to recruit top talent and they are trying to cope with the rising costs of healthcare. Plus their buildings tend to be historically old and tend to need updates to their infrastructure,” she said.Mr Knight, who was raised in Portland, Oregon the son of a lawyer turned newspaper publisher, has built a fortune estimated at $7bn.He attended the University of Oregon, where he was a middle-distance runner for track team, and he graduated with a degree in journalism in 1959. He enlisted in the army for a year, then enrolled at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford. “Stanford Business School was an important part of my life,” said Mr Knight. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to give back to the school.”
730;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-07-28T15:03:28Z;Arne Alsin: Owners can claim an advantage in the long run;;Data show that stocks generate higher returns than any other asset category over the long term. But data aren’t necessary to make the case. A powerful argument can be made through a proper understanding of stocks.Asset classes can be put into two broad categories. There are “do nothing” assets and “do something” assets. The do nothing category includes a variety of assets, such as precious metals and raw land. When left untouched, these make no product, render no service, and generate no income. It should come as no surprise that the long-term return from them approximates the rate of inflation.The list of do something assets includes investments such as certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, and T-bills. The do something category includes sub-categories commonly known as debt and equity.I prefer to distinguish between debt and equity investors as “loaners” and “owners”. If you invest in debt, you are a loaner. You lend your capital to the government in exchange for a T-bill, to a bank in exchange for a CD, to an insurance company in exchange for an annuity, or to a corporation in exchange for a bond.If you invest in equity, you are an owner. Buy an interest in the local car wash and you are an owner. Buy shares in Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike and you are a part-owner of these companies (I am not).In general, it is better to be an owner than a loaner. The upside is unlimited for owners, while the upside for loaners is fixed. When you lend your capital to the government, you will get back the capital you lent plus interest and not a penny more.Alignment of interests puts owners in a much more enviable position than a loaner. Ask your bank how much interest it will pay on a CD. You and the bank have competing objectives. You want to make as much as possible and the bank wants to pay you as little as possible.Instead of lending capital to your bank through a CD, consider the alignment of interests if you bought stock in the bank instead. All big decisions at the bank, such as how much interest to pay on savings accounts and how much to charge for loans, are made with the owners’ interest in mind.Control is an important advantage owners have. For example, when a loaner lends capital to a business, control of that capital is ceded to the business.Adaptability is a significant advantage that owners have over loaners. When they make a loan, lenders are implicitly betting their capital will not be impaired by future change. A jump in inflation is one example of a change that can harm a loaner. A long-term bondholder is stuck when inflation jumps because adaptation to a higher inflation environment is not possible.The ability to adapt to change mitigates capital risk for owners. The owner of shares in Coca-Cola does not have to make a bet on how consumer beverage preferences will evolve. Whether demand surges or not is not an issue. That owner only has to bet that Coca-Cola management will adapt accordingly.The fact that casinos take a significant percentage of the total bets placed means that, as a group, bettors lose money. The odds are stacked against you if you bet in casinos consistently over the long term.In the stock market, the opposite is true. There is a high probability of success with consistent investment over the long term. I call it the “inevitability of reward”. Businesses exist to make profit. As profits accumulate, value accumulates. Since 1920 the combined companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been profitable every year, with the single exception being a small loss in 1932.It’s likely that over the next 10 years the total cumulative profit of Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike will be impressive.With that in mind, is it a good bet that these companies will be more valuable in 10 years? That is for you to decide.Arne Alsin is a portfolio manager for Alsin Capital and for the Turnaround fundarne@alsincapital.com
731;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-07-20T19:11:23Z;Wal-Mart courts MySpace generation;;Wal-Mart, the discount US retailer, has tentatively embraced the world of MySpace and YouTube with an online competition that allows teenagers the opportunity to load videos and photographs on to their own web pages.In the latest move by the retailer to shed its low-rent image, teenagers are being asked to become “hubsters” – by signing up at a Wal-Mart site and creating their own web page using both pre-loaded and original content.“It’s part of Wal-Mart’s effort to become hipper,” said Lauren Freedman, head of E-tailing retail consultants.Wal-Mart says winning videos will eventually be professionally edited and possibly used for advertising on both cable TV and in cinemas – following similar initiatives over the past two years from BMW and Nike’s Converse brand.Under John Fleming, who became Wal-Mart’s chief marketing officer last year, the retailer has moved away from its traditional stodgy TV commercials and newspaper inserts, with more focused advertising targeting segmented groups such as such as Hispanics, young women and “urban” males.Wal-Mart described the project as “a unique means of deepening WMT’s relationship with our back-to-school customers through an online platform that is fun, engaging and familiar to them”.Wal-Mart’s venture into consumer-generated advertising follows the mixed experience of GM’s Chevrolet brand earlier this year, when an online promotion for its Tahoe SUV led to a range of ads criticising the company’s record on issues such as fuel economy and global warming.Wal-Mart’s site is more strictly regulated, requiring proof of parental consent, and excluding potentially inappropriate material – including impersonations of “a government official or other public person”.It also prohibits users from publishing details such as e-mail addresses or phone numbers.Tim Stock, of brand consultants scenarioDNA, was sceptical of the impact of the Wal-Mart project, saying the limits on content would put off potential teenage users.“It’s taking a MySpace type experience, and putting a box around it. But kids don’t want what companies say they should want. They seek out what they want, especially in a social networking technology.”The move by Wal-Mart also reflects growing interest among conventional retailers in exploiting the potential of the web for creating interactive experiences for online communities.
732;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-07-20T17:24:44Z;Wal-Mart’s amateur advertisers;;"Could Babi, Sam Flow and Jay Jay So Sexy represent the future for Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer?All three are featured on the personal web pages of The Hub – School My Way, an online project that is part of its current “back-to-school” season marketing campaign.Launched earlier this month, The Hub is Wal-Mart’s latest bid to reach out to fashion-conscious youth consumers, urging them to “check out what styles are on the horizon”, and to “express your style”.It also marks the giant retailer’s first venture into the rapidly evolving world of interactive consumer-generated advertising – with an online competition inviting high school students to create their own web pages and videos, with the winners to be used in a Wal-Mart cable television commercial, possibly also for cinema release.The “School My Way” project is jointly sponsored by Sony, and put together by Wal-Mart’s GSD&M marketing agency, part of Omnicom, the world’s biggest marketing services agency. It follows similar campaigns this year by Nike and its Converse brand, and by MasterCard, Toyota Motor and L’Oréal.Such strategies are a response to broader changes in the way media is consumed, especially by teen­agers and people aged in their 20s, an audience prized by advertisers.The rapid spread of high-speed internet connections, together with the greater ease with which people can put their own text, audio and video content on the web and edit it, has changed media consumption from a passive experience to an interactive one. The same factors are also contributing to increased viewing of video on the web, including video advertising, previously available mainly on television.“This is the most creative generation that ever lived,” said Aaron Cohen, chief executive of Bolt.com, a user-generated content site which this week ran a competition to create a cyberspace “virtual band”, sponsored by the Wendy’s hamburger chain.“For these consumers, everything is recorded on their phones or on digital cameras. Just as watching ­television is entertaining for many older people; for
them, putting up music and videos and being part of a group talking about this is entertaining.”MySpace.com, the world’s biggest social networking site – and owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp – has nearly 250,000 new people around the world signing up every day and is expected to reach 100m registered users next month. The site, launched just three years ago, allows users to create personal profiles and put up blogs, video and songs, link to other users and communicate with them. It is now being tested by many advertisers, for example, with the creation of profiles based around made-up characters promoting a product.Reggie Bradford is chief executive of ViTrue, a company that provides marketers with the technology to create interactive advertising and which is in talks about partnering with a large advertising agency. He says that while this year a handful of brands were experimenting with the new interactive advertisements, he expects hundreds of campaigns next year.“We are just scratching the surface. Instead of a small number of ad agency executives creating the best ads, millions of people will be contributing to creating the best ads. This is a huge change that will really enhance brand advertising.”Compared with the tens of billions of dollars spent every year on television advertising, the amount spent on internet video advertising is very small: probably tens of millions of dollars in the US, according to some estimates. Even as a share of the rapidly growing internet advertising sector, which reached $12.5bn last year in the US, video commercials are tiny, with most spending going on search- word advertisements.YouTube, the fast-growing video-watching site, which recently passed the milestone of 100m video downloads a day, does not carry much advertising, in spite of its reach. This is partly because many advertisers are cautious about the new media. The risks of being associated with inappropriate or illegally reproduced content might damage a brand’s reputation.Indeed, the perils of handing over creative control to the internet were demonstrated earlier this year by GM’s Chevrolet brand’s new advertising-building website for the launch of its Tahoe 2007 SUV, where viewers were able to add their own text to a selection of clips and music. The responses included more than 3,000 attacking the company over fuel economy, global warming and its safety record.Wal-Mart has adopted a restricted format, with rules that preclude posting a range of potentially offensive material – including impersonations of politicians and other public figures. Web pages can only use recorded music from a limited selection of songs made available on the site by Sony.All submissions are also reviewed. As a result, after 10 days of operations, most of the original video submissions were still blank and marked “pending approval”.Registering to join Wal-Mart’s Hubster community also requires parental consent. Registered Hubsters are not allowed to post personal contact details, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses or last names.Wal-Mart’s effort comes at a time when other mainstream online retailers are beginning to take a closer look at the opportunities for creating online communities – which can both reinforce customer loyalty and provide valuable marketing feedback.Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival in the US, this year started posting customer reviews below products on its online site – using technology developed by Amazon Web Services, which administers the Target site.Amazon itself has pushed even further ahead in the US, developing its online reviews to create user profile pages that can include photographs, e-mail addresses and lists of recommendations. These can then be linked to other selected “Amazon friends”.It is also continuing to test “tagging”, which allows a user to create a personal set of links connecting a variety of recommended product pages under topics such as “money” or “amazing story”.Tim Stock, president of scenarioDNA, a brand consultancy, argues that the Amazon site – unlike Wal-Mart’s marketing-focused Hub – reflects a more appropriate understanding of the role that social networking can play.“A lot of companies are still misunderstanding what social networks are,” he says. “They’re not websites . . . they’re people who use the technology to connect. So you have to do something that is authentic, and offer something to make them want to use it. You are tapping in to what people do naturally.”YO, BUYERS! DIY COMMERCIALS DRIVEN BY FUN, FAME AND FORTUNENew web tools and cheap technology make it easy for people to create their own material for advertising. Online blogs, pictures, videos and music can be home-made or edited versions of existing content. Yet they still require people to do some work rather than just sit back and watch something. Why should anyone take the time and trouble to make advertisements for a company that is not their client or employer?■It’s fun. Contributors enjoy the creative aspects and entertainment of making their own videos or music.■Fifteen minutes of fame. Many websites offer the chance to get your art, video or music shown to the world, either online or on television or even in film advertising. You no longer need to have good contacts or luck to get one of a handful of jobs at advertising agencies.■Prizes. Probably the most traditional of incentives, prizes are already used in many marketing campaigns. The chance to win fashionable clothes, electronic goods or tickets to concerts or film screenings, often with exclusive access to stars, remains a popular way for companies to try to encourage participation.■Money. Advertising agencies are starting to experiment with paying people to reflect the popularity of their advertisements, using the pay-per-click model commonly used in the online advertising world. As well as giving amateurs an incentive to try to make great advertisements, this model might also encourage agency employees to do their most creative work incognito, unhampered by the need for client approval."
733;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-07-03T19:20:01Z;World Cup sponsors;;When Germany and Italy meet tonight in the semi-finals of the World Cup, the bitterest divide will arguably be in the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach: home to Adidas and Puma, the rival sports brands. The former sponsors Germany, while Puma’s leaping cat adorns the Italian kit.There is much at stake for both companies but Puma, the smaller, has more to gain. Italy is the last of Puma’s 12 teams still in with a chance of lifting the trophy, whereas Adidas sponsors both France and the tournament itself.Puma’s World Cup marketing strategy has, Italy aside, largely favoured second-tier teams. Sponsorship of a top team is said to cost tens of millions of euros annually, while less well-known squads are cheap.Puma’s percentage return on its outlay should, therefore, compare favourably with that of Adidas, as well as Nike, the event’s other big sportswear sponsor. Puma, as ever, is also playing the long game: its focus on African teams should leave it favourably positioned for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.For Adidas, the tournament has already served an important purpose: raising the group’s profile, and revenues, in a potentially difficult year of transition after the acquisition of Reebok. Once the final whistle is blown, investors’ attention will shift back to progress on integration.Right now, Nike’s luck appears to be running out. It still has Portugal, but favourites Brazil are out. Thankfully for Nike, however, the World Cup is not the only game in town. Credit Suisse estimates the global football kit market at €3.2bn – equivalent to just 14 per cent of last year’s combined revenues for Nike, Puma, and Adidas/Reebok. In addition, the highest growth markets over the rest of the decade are likely to be the US and China. The playing field in those regions should be a tad more level.
734;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-06-29T20:55:18Z;Someone must do running for Ronaldinho;;"It’s strange to think back to Brazil’s first game of the World Cup, only 17 days ago. Seventy-two thousand pilgrims from all over the world packed into Hitler’s Olympic Stadium on the promise of seeing the Brazilians demolish Croatia with the best football ever. Fairly typical was a Finnish friend of mine who flew in from Beijing and paid a tout €300 for his match ticket. We should all have known better.Brazil remain the most likely world champions, but to expect them to play “jogo bonito” – the “beautiful game” – is to misunderstand this team.Blaming their cautious football on their coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, is simplistic. The coach of Brazil is not an omnipotent being, but merely a guy who sits in the dugout and watches his players along with the rest of us. The Brazilians who meet France in tomorrow’s quarter-final are probably the most experienced
football team ever. Five starters have played in at least one World Cup final. Their greenest regular, Adriano, still has 35 caps.The Brazilians of 1966 had about as much experience of World Cups, but the current side trump them with decades of employment at Europe’s biggest clubs. This lot know how trophies are won, and it isn’t with dribbles or five-man forward lines. Roberto Carlos complains: “The ‘joga bonito’ slogan was invented by a sports brand. It’s not our fault.”It’s true that Nike came up with “joga bonito” – “play beautifully” – but the original phrase “jogo bonito” is Pelé’s. Sadly, all this is irrelevant. The Brazilians know that you win World Cups by conserving energy for the last few matches, or at least for the party afterwards. That is why they haven’t been putting their full weight into tackles. For any Brazilian starter, the biggest risk to his winner’s medal is not defeat but injury. Brazil’s bench is so strong that anyone getting hurt may never regain his place. The Brazilians therefore seldom tussle for loose balls with clumsy opponents. Together with Japan, they have averaged the fewest fouls per game in the tournament.Brazil’s defensive midfielders rarely press the opposition. Any shots they permit are eaten up by their goalkeeper, Dida, probably their
best player so far. In the energy-saving mode of this team, Dida positions himself so well that he rarely has to dive.This is not the football Parreira wants to see. But he doesn’t aspire to “joga bonito” either. Instead he wants Brazil to pass the ball around for long stretches. “When we put the ball on the ground, we have a technical advantage that is superior to any opponent,” he says. But to pass, you need players willing to run into space to receive the ball. Ronaldinho ran in 2002, when he was the team’s junior member. This year only Robinho – currently injured – has budged much.Ronaldinho has grown so frustrated that against Ghana on Tuesday he actually stopped smiling. Several times after passing into nothingness, he turned to the intended recipient (usually Adriano) and demonstrated with his hands how the player should have run: hook sideways, then sprint deep. Once, after crossing a ball that Adriano could have headed in had he but moved, Ronaldinho made an even simpler gesture: he nodded an imitation header. Presumably Adriano understood. Ronaldinho excels at Barcelona where Samuel Eto’o and Ludovic Giuly chase his passes, but with Brazil he is helpless.This is not a team. When asked about Brazil’s strengths, Juninho Pernambucano didn’t give the ritual answer of “the collective”, but said: “Our individuals.” Brilliant players will score. Their first half against Ghana said it all: a minority share of possession, four shots, two goals. After scoring, Brazil can play their favourite game: not “jogo bonito”, but the counter-attack. They abandoned it only against Japan. The Japanese made the mistake of scoring first, thus waking the beast and earning themselves a 4-1 caning.Brazil now have eleven consecutive victories at World Cups, three more than the previous record. Their toughest opponents in that sequence were Belgium and Turkey. The World Cup rarely tests football’s lone superpower.A German observer of their 3-0 victory over Ghana described the Brazilians as “Harlem Globetrotters who have forgotten to go to Weight Watchers”. But the Brazilians knew they didn’t need to cut down on the cakes to beat Ghana. They are resigned to having to work in their last three matches. They may even need to ditch their passengers. Adriano has been outpaced by every defender. Cafu is 36, seldom reaches the byline any longer, was repeatedly bamboozled by Croatia’s Dado Prso, and after a sprint in the last minute against Ghana lay down on the grass as if to nap. The 33-year-old Roberto Carlos springs to life only when Brazil get a free-kick – the old man’s refuge – which he ritually blasts into space. But he is a luxury Brazil can afford. They could win a second straight World Cup playing at half-cock."

737;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Nike in $3bn share buy-back;;"Nike on Monday announced a $3bn share buy-back programme, in the hope of bolstering its languishing stock price and signalling confidence to shareholders.The world’s largest sporting goods company faces fierce competition, notably from Germany’s Adidas and Puma, and is under pressure in Western Europe and Japan.Nike said it expected to complete its previous four-year, $1.5bn buy-back programme in the next few weeks. Philip Knight, chairman, said that by doubling the size of the new authorisation to $3bn, Nike was “confident in the strength” of its cash flow.Over the five-fiscal-year period ending in May, Nike returned $2.2bn to shareholders through the repurchase of 31.1m shares, the company said.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, recently told clients an “aggressive” share repurchase programme “could be a catalyst the stock needs”. Such a move, she said in a report prior to the announcement, would “immediately improve Nike’s return on invested capital, which has been weighed down by its very high cash levels; eliminate the uncertainty that the company might use the cash for an acquisition; and signal to the market Nike management believes in its business and that the level the stock is trading at is unjustified”.Nike’s shares were down 8 cents at $83.07 by the close in New York. The company reports fourth-quarter results next week and is expected to earn $1.39 a share compared with $1.30 a year ago.The company reports fourth-quarter results next week and is expected to earn $1.39 a share compared with $1.30 a year ago.Ms McShane said Nike’s top line would benefit from “continued strength in the US footwear business, sales of World Cup product, and double-digit growth in its ‘other’ business due to continued strength in the Converse, Cole Haan and Nike golf businesses”.Nike has a lot at stake in the football World Cup, where it is vying with Adidas, its nearest rival, for the top position in the sport. Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, has said “football is the number one played sport, and so if we want to stay the number one company in the industry we are going to have to be the number one in football”."
738;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-06-15T17:48:23Z;Puma kicks S African plans into play;;This year’s football World Cup has only just started for most. But already Puma‘s attentions are turning to the next competition to be held in 2010 in South Africa.Jochen Zeitz, chief executive of the German sporting goods group, said he wanted to build on Puma’s dominance of African football to quadruple its revenues in the continent by 2012.Puma has already more than doubled turnover in Africa in each of the past two years and the region accounts for about 3 per cent of its ?2bn ($2.52bn) sales. “Only 1,295 days left to the World Cup year 2010,” said Mr Zeitz in Johannesburg on Thursday.Puma is sponsoring all five African teams in the current World Cup, including Ivory Coast and Ghana, and sponsors a further five teams from the continent such as Senegal and Cameroon. It also supports United For Africa, an aid organisation, and is basing much of its marketing push on African teams.Puma is the leading football brand in Africa and in the top three overall in the sporting goods market. But Mr Zeitz said becoming number one was not the goal.“That is never our goal - we always set our goals against what we can achieve not against our competitors. In the bigger picture Africa isn’t the largest region for us but it is important. It represents what our brand stands for - having fun and innovating. It has much more significance than pure blunt turnover.”Puma’s goal in football has been to establish itself as a strong third player alongside Adidas and Nike. At this year’s World Cup it is sponsoring the most teams - 12 against Nike’s eight and Adidas’ six, but rivals snipe that it has picked up sides few are interested in.Mr Zeitz said he felt Puma had now successfully broadened the big two in football into a big three.He added on the current World Cup: “The World Cup is a great success - the stadiums are full, the fans are great and overall there is a very positive atmosphere, which is good for Germany.”
739;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Jonathan Guthrie: Ethics, enterprise and expediency;;"Monaco’s main conference centre was the handy venue for a debate on how business could help the poor and save the planet last week. The key delegates were multimillionaire entrepreneurs who, if they tired of talking, only needed to nip across the road for a spot of shopping. Nearby stores offered Maybach limousines to drive to the casino ($600,000), two-bedroom flats bestowing tax-free residency ($4m) or luxury yachts to moor in the harbour ($7m and up).These options were not open to a member of the urbane poor like me. So I was prepared to sit through the session, having selected a pair of stout matchsticks with which to prop open my eyelids. Debates on corporate social responsibility thrill me as little as talks on diesel locomotives by bobble-hatted trainspotters, with the difference that I am under no obligation to attend the latter.The event, however, was surprisingly compelling. The organisers, Ernst & Young and BBC World Service, had intelligently recruited two panellists guaranteed to fight like rats in a sack. Their scrapping triggered a rare lucid moment in which I realised that CSR has become so pervasive that opposition to it is now as pointless as ordering an incoming tide to retreat.John Hilary of War on Want, a traditional lefty, thundered: “We cannot accept unbridled free market capitalism.” Richard D. North of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs, countered: “Capitalist firms do well for the world when they are selfish and honest about it.” But their positions were remarkably similar. Both men believed public morality should be determined by governments through law-making and that businesses should refrain from do-gooding. Mr Hilary distrusted corporate motives. Mr North saw wealth creation as more important.Like Mr North, I believe the sole social responsibility of companies is to make profits, some of which governments trouser to pay for schools, hospitals and welfare. But while pundits such as Mr North may often triumph rhetorically, they have lost the sale. Businesses increasingly espouse ethical goals as an adjunct to good old-fashioned moneymaking.A few years ago CSR was primarily an activity for big US consumer brands, such as Nike and Gap, whose reputations had been damaged by allegations that some Asian suppliers ran sweatshops. They needed to ensure goods were sourced ethically to claw back sales.Since then, ethics have spread across business like a nasty rash. HSBC, the world’s third biggest bank, boasts it has achieved carbon neutrality, a goal rather harder for its manufacturing clients to achieve. The motto of Google, the world’s dominant internet search company, is “Don’t be evil” (but don’t stand up for freedom of speech in China either). Al Gore, the dullest president the US never had, now chairs a fund manager whose investments are “sustainable”, even if its returns are not. David Cameron, the leader of the once commerce-friendly UK Conservatives, has told British business to “shed its evil image”, as Tories themselves must.The entrepreneurs from 32 countries assembled in Monaco last week were as inclined to talk about their pet social projects as their business empires. They may have figured this increased their chances of winning the title “World Entrepreneur of the Year”, for which they were competing (see Business Life). But at the same time, CSR is often just a new bottle into which the old wine of philanthropy is decanted. If you have accumulated more wealth than you can easily enjoy, it is natural to swap some of it for public gratitude, even if you do not concur with US steel baron Andrew Carnegie that “a man who dies rich dies disgraced”.For most companies, renouncing the devil and all his works involves adopting ethical policies on employment, sourcing and the environment and helping local charities. For instance, a Monaco-
based enterprise might support an aid programme for unemployed yacht brokers. A CSR vigilante force, consisting of vociferous non-governmental organisations and fee-hungry consultancies, keeps businesses up to the mark.The oft-quoted business case for CSR is that customers prefer to buy from companies exhibiting “good corporate citizenship”. The evidence for this seems pretty patchy. Low prices continue to lure millions of Americans to Wal-Mart, despite the opprobrium the store chain’s employment and sourcing policies provoke in ethical campaigners.A much better argument, which is also satisfyingly Machiavellian, is that businesses can forestall regulation by behaving with conspicuous virtue, thereby keeping a lid on costs. The recent, well-publicised enthusiasm for the good works of Tesco, the UK supermarket chain under investigation for alleged anti-competitive practices, may owe something to this stratagem.The beauty of this “compliance-
plus” approach is that it fits seamlessly into the Friedmanite conception of businesses as entities that should be single-minded in their pursuit of profit. Being good becomes simply another lever for jacking up the bottom line. As always, your perceived intention is crucial to how your actions are interpreted by others. So it is important for executives to refrain from shouting “come and get it, losers” to homeless people they are charitably supplying with free soup. CSR does not work unless you believe in it. Or, at least, pretend to."
740;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-06-12T17:56:08Z;Market woes derail 3 Italia IPO plans;;"3 Italia, the telecoms company owned by Hong Kong’s Hutchison Whampoa, looks unlikely to launch its long-awaited initial public offering this year as poor market sentiment continues to upset the plans of Italian companies wishing to go public.The depressed environment for new company launches has also hit Italtel, the telecoms equipment supplier. Its listing is also on hold after the company initially wanted to start an investor roadshow in the middle of May.It now says it is waiting for the right market conditions, a process that could take “days, weeks or months”.3 Italia has not said anything in public on the subject of its listing for some time.However, people close to its strategy admit that the market launch, originally intended to be the Italian market’s largest of last year, has become far less likely to happen, even by the end of the year.Hutchison had wanted a valuation of about €12bn ($15bn) for 3 Italia and was planning to sell 20-25 per cent of the company. But it acknowledged in March that the market was probably prepared to give the company a valuation of only €9bn.3 Italia, in common with other telecoms companies, is portraying itself more as a media company that offers products such as live television to its customers. It believes that this entitles it to a higher market valuation.A successful performance for its live broadcasts over telephones of World Cup football matches could help sell its case.It has already attracted advertisers such as Nike and Mercedes Benz.Market analysts point out that Italian economic growth is likely to stay far below the average of the European Union this year; that there have been no large IPOs on the Milan exchange in 2006; and that some smaller offerings have fared badly, including that of oil company Saras.Shares in telecoms companies worldwide have also underperformed other sectors.Italtel, meanwhile, is aiming for a market capitalisation of €800m-€1bn after its listing but clearly feels that would be difficult.Its three main shareholders – Cisco of the US, Telecom Italia and Clayton, Dubilier Rice, the private equity group – will be retaining control of the company, holding on to at least 50 per cent between them.This is the second time that the company has considered an IPO. In 2004, its main shareholders failed to agree on strategy and the listing was postponed.Wind, another large Italian mobile telecoms company, will be watching developments closely.Naguib Sawiris, Wind’s chairman who bought control of the company from the utility Enel last year, has been talking about an IPO for the financial vehicle that controls Wind at the end of the year or the beginning of 2007."
741;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-06-07T17:21:47Z;Adidas wins first round in stripes battle;;"Top tennis stars will be able to wear fully branded Adidas kit at Wimbledon this year after the German sportswear manufacturer on Wednesday won the first round of a High Court battle with the international tennis establishment.A senior judge agreed to the company’s request for an injunction requiring the International Tennis Federation and other governing bodies to suspend a strict dress rule that would have limited the size of the company’s distinctive three-stripe design at Grand Slam tournaments until a full trial of the matter later this year.This has been scheduled for October. But Adidas, which sponsors tennis stars such as Andre Agassi and Tim Henman, claimed that if it had to comply with the dress rule in the two big events this summer – Wimbledon and the US Open – there could have been a significant adverse effect on its sales.“Adidas would have been greatly prejudiced by the proposed interpretation of the dress rule,” said Guy Leigh, at Addleshaw Goddard, the law firm acting for the company.The rule would have classed the three-stripes mark as a logo and restrict this to four square inches.“Adidas welcomes the High Court's decision to allow [it] to continue to use three stripes on tennis apparel until a full trial,"" he added.The judge also refused to strike out claims by Adidas that the proposed dress rule was discriminatory against itself, in relation to other competing sportswear manufacturers, and a breach of EU competition laws.Instead, Sir Andrew Morritt ruled the company had a ""reasonable prospect of
succeeding"" on the claims at trial.Adidas's case is being brought against the ITF and organisers of the four Grand Slam tournaments – Wimbledon, the Paris Open, the US Open and the Australian Open.They had asked the judge to dismiss the action at this pre-trial stage on the grounds that certain decisions of regulatory sporting bodies did not fall within the scope of the European Community Treaty. They claimed the dress code was ""objectively justifiable"" and they denied any discrimination against the German company.But Sir Andrew said: ""I conclude that Adidas has a real prospect of success in its claim.""Adidas's court win is the latest development in a bitter battle between the world's leading sporting goods groups, with Adidas on one side and its rivals, led by Nike and Puma, on the other.Two years ago, they wrote to the International Olympic Committee to complain that the use by Adidas of its three-stripes motif in the design of clothing worn at the Athens Olympics breached the IOC's dress code.Discussions ensued within the IOC and also within the men's and women's tennis tours – the ATP and the WTA."
742;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-06-01T17:03:22Z;Media owners expecting $1bn advertising boost;;Whoever lifts the FIFA World Cup trophy at the soccer tournament’s final in Berlin on July 9, the loudest cheers could come from the media owners sharing an estimated $1bn boost in global advertising from the event.With only a week to go until the opening game, traditional media are facing a myriad challenges to revenues and audiences. But the event still offers brands an unrivalled chance to reach mass viewers worldwide.Television viewing figures for this year’s tournament in Germany are almost certain to show sharp increases from its predecessors in Japan/South Korea in 2002 and France in 1998.This is mainly because matches will be better scheduled to capture lucrative peak time audiences in key European markets, without forcing soccerphiles in Latin America to forego sleep as they did four years ago.But in spite of more advantageous scheduling, the event is not immune from the changes in technology and consumer habits that have swept the sector in the last four years.And some media buyers are sceptical the contest will provide its traditional filip to commercial TV broadcasters.Dominic Fawcett, a managing partner at Mindshare Worldwide who buys and plans media spending for Nike, the US sportswear company, across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says: “People have maybe downgraded the World Cup as a spot advertising opportunity, thinking ‘How much is my advertising really going to cut through?’ A lot of international brands have tried to do their advertising earlier to capitalise on what they see as the interest in the run-up to games as opposed to the tournament itself, which is seen as very cluttered with rival branding messages.”FIFA will attempt to address this concern for the next tournament in South Africa in 2010 by cutting the number of official partners or sponsors from 15 to 6.Sceptics, however, detect a wider shift in attitudes among some marketers as they seek to engage media-savvy customers via events and new forms of content - some of it funded by brands themselves - rather than in conventional advertising.In the major soccer-viewing economies of Europe, some analysts believe the Champions’ League has stolen the glamour of the global competition and offers brands the added possibility of running season-long campaigns.To complicate matters further, some consumer goods and female-skewed brands, which would be expected to advertise during June and July, are now expected to hold back, arguing that airtime can be expensive and inappropriate given the fast food, beer and male youth brands that tend to set the tone for TV commercials during the tournament.Even accepting all these caveats, the event retains its hold over some of the industry’s leading strategists, particularly for its appeal to young men, who are typically light consumers of mass television and print.Kevin Alavy, senior analyst at Initiative Futures, said: “Media fragmentation is an important trend but the World Cup and to some extent the Euro Football Championships are two great exceptions. For reaching all corners of the globe and providing shared experiences, it resonates strongly today. I expect that will still be the case in 8 or 12 years’ time.”
743;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-05-29T16:29:47Z;Worth watching;;Mind over matterIn an earlier TWW I touched on a development in the area of thought-controlled technology, outlining a system that allowed a person with electrodes attached to their skull to move a cursor across a computer screen simply by thinking it in a particular direction.Now a new advance has been made in this area as according to a report on NewScientists.com a team of scientists in Japan have built a robotic hand controlled by the power of thought alone using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human brain activity.The hand mimics the the movements of a real human hand to the extent that the robotic appendage successfully formed “rock, paper, scissors” shapes when the brain activity of human subjects forming the same shapes was mapped by an MRI scanner and fed as data to a connected computer.Following a short training period, the computer was able to recognise the brain activity associated with the formation of each shape and tell the robotic hand to do the same movement.An fMRI machine probes activity within the brain by monitoring blood flow to different areas of the organ, using a strong magnetic field combined with radiofrequency pulses to probe the magnetic state of hydrogen atoms in water molecules within the body tissue.The developers - from the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto and the Honda Research Institute in Saitama - envisage a day when the robot hand could respond faster to though impulses than a normal hand, but admit that several technological breakthroughs - especially in regards to the speed and cost - will be needed before this sort of technology can be used in everyday life.ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories: http://www.cns.atr.jp/dcn/Honda Research Institute: http://world.honda.com/HondaResearchInstituteJapan/‘Track’ shoesJoggers take note! Keeping tabs on those essential running stats has never been easier according to Nike and Apple.The two companies have hooked up to produce a new breed of Nike trainers - soon to hit stores - which can wirelessly link to Apple’s iPod digital music players.Many of Nike’s leading brands will be embedded with technology that transmits time, distance, calories burned and pace data to runners’ iPods.The new range of shoes will be designed to work with Nike+iPod Sport Kit, a wireless system retailing for about $30 that includes an in-shoe sensor and a receiver that attaches to an iPod.The performance information is displayed on the iPod screen and relayed audibly in real time via iPod headsets. It can also be downloaded to PCs so runners can track their training progress.And they won’t have to break their stride to pore through the iPod menu to pick that perfect motivational song.Runners can program their iPods with inspirational songs to kick in during steep climbs or when a burst of speed is craved near a finish line. Surely “Simply the Best” by Tina Turner on repeat play is all any self-respecting athlete needs.Nike: http://www.nike.com/main.htmlApple: http://www.apple.com/Smart gunResearchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology say they are close to perfecting the the first commercially viable “smart gun”.According to a report in Popsci.com, the prototype pistol is designed to recognise specific people’s grips and when seized by an unauthorised hand, such as a criminal or a child, the gun locks its shooting mechanism.The gun uses Dynamic Grip Recognition, a biometric technology embedded in its handle. Sensors and microprocessors analyse the unique interplay of bones and muscles used when the trigger is pulled.With 29,000 firearm deaths in the US every year, the device has won the support of some gun-safety advocates, although with a failure rate of one in a 100 trigger pulls the technology is not yet foolproof.The developers are hoping to reduce this rate to one in 10,000 - the Pentagon standard for military weapons - by lifting the number of grip sensors from the current figure of 32 to hundreds and improving the pattern-recognition software. The scientists hope the gun will be ready for market by 2008.They anticipate that users will program the weapon at the firing range of a local police station. The registration process will consist of the owner test-firing the gun 10 times with each trigger pull activating the pressure sensors embedded in the handle. Microprocessors will then analyse the data and create a permanent profile of the user’s grip.New Jersey Institute of Technology: http://www.njit.edu/

by Barbara Smit
Penguin ₤14.99, 416 pagesNext month one of the bitterest contests at the football World Cup will take place not between national teams but between sporting goods companies. The three stripes, swoosh and leaping cat - otherwise known as the logos of Adidas, Nike and Puma - will all be jostling for position in the month-long competition in Germany.Adidas and Puma, the two German companies, are under particular pressure to perform. Adidas, the bigger of the two, intends “to dominate” the competition by spending an estimated €150m on marketing. Puma, which has only a fifth of Adidas’s revenues, is sponsoring more teams than any other brand. The fight is global, but at its heart is a story of a tiny Bavarian town and a bitter split between two brothers.The two companies are still based in Herzogenaurach - a town of 23,000 inhabitants, where residents seem more likely to wear discount-store clothing than the latest trends.Pitch Invasion by Barbara Smit, a journalist at the industry bible Sporting Goods Intelligence, is at its best when detailing the extraordinary genesis of the two companies and their fierce rivalry. Two brothers, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, set up a sports footwear company in the 1920s. The idea of shoes just for sport was unusual at the time, but they were soon pulling off triumphs such as equipping Jesse Owens for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.The 1948 split between the brothers - the details of which are laid bare for the first time in this book - divided not only the Dassler family but the entire town with Adidas (derived from the name Adi Dassler) on one side of the river Aurach and Puma (a softer form of a similarly derived Ruda) on the other.Today, executives from both companies reserve a special sort of enmity for the other; Adidas attempts not to belittle itself by talking about its smaller rival, while Puma believes its cross-town competitor is a country bumpkin compared to its own urbaneness.Pitch Invasion is a breathless account of how the rivalry brought money and sharp branding into sport - long before upstarts from across the Atlantic such as Nike burst on to the scene in the 1970s and 1980s. Telling anecdotes abound on each page, from the petty - Adidas officials cancelling Puma’s hire cars at big sporting events - to the commercial - Pele and Mark Spitz flashing their logos when they shouldn’t, just to earn their sponsorship dollars.Even more striking than the rivalry between the brothers, however, is that between the generations in the Adidas family. Adi Dassler, through his focus on product and relationships with sportsmen such as the successful West German football team from the 1954 World Cup, had soon beaten his brother. But his more formidable rival was his son, Horst.Adi made Horst head of Adidas in France but the son had soon constructed a parallel network. Distributors would face two pitches, one from Adidas Germany and one from Adidas France. Often they would be caught in the middle of family crossfire. Horst even managed to build up an entire sporting goods conglomerate - consisting of Le Coq Sportif, Arena and Pony and the sporting rights company ISL - without his parents knowing. When they found out, it broke their hearts.Beyond the company rivalry, the book runs out of some steam. It also highlights that ultimately this is the story of Adidas - with a few words and less sympathy for Puma. Other flaws include a fairly uncritical view of the deep and money-oiled relationship Adidas built up with the most important sports officials, men such as Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, and Joao Havelange, head of the football governing body Fifa.Smit herself acknowledges in a foreword that the book fails to tackle the Far East factories, described as sweatshops by critics, where sport shoes are produced these days. The book would have been better if she had looked at the question.Smit shows an unremitting focus on producing a page-turner. While at times this it to the detriment of deeper analysis, she pulls it off with aplomb. Ultimately she highlights how two companies outgrew their traditional family roots and finally prospered after brushes with extinction in the early 1990s. They now stand as two of the most successful German consumer companies, although globally they lag behind their US rival Nike.And by the World Cup final, both Adidas and Puma will know whether they are headed for promotion or relegation in the next stage of their battle.Richard Milne is an FT correspondent in Frankfurt."

It is designed to ramp up pressure on the industry and its stars ahead of next month’s World Cup.The sportswear industry had “turned the World Cup into a catwalk,” said Kelly Dent, one of the Oxfam report’s authors. “We’re saying: ‘Sure, enjoy the World Cup. But while you are enjoying the World Cup think about the reality of life for the workers who make the boots that are being worn.”Ms Dent said Oxfam sought to test the control mechanisms put in place by footwear manufacturers in recent years to address problems with their Asian suppliers and rid themselves of a public relations stain. The result, she said, was the discovery that many of those systems were often reliant on violations being identified by local and international activists as well as labour unions.According to the report, international brands also “frequently undermine and contradict their stated commitment to respect trade union rights”.Among the cases highlighted by Oxfam is that of Panarub, a big Indonesian supplier of Adidas football boots. Oxfam praises the German company for working to address issues at the Panarub plant but questions the firing last October of more than 30 union members for going out on strike.Frank Henke, global director for social and environmental affairs for the Adidas group, said on Tuesday the company was monitoring the case. But he said the decision to fire the workers had come about after they moved their labour action on to company grounds in what amounted to an illegal strike. Adidas was awaiting a ruling from the country’s human rights commission before it decided how to proceed.

The Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and Malaria, the single largest multilateral donor of aid, is to consider whether to accept such support soon.A study by McKinsey, the management consultant, suggested companies might be willing to contribute up to $500m (£266m) a year in goods and services to bodies involved in Aids work, but far smaller amounts in cash.Suspicion of how money would be spent, and the difficulty in winning shareholder support, have led many to favour in-kind gifts.Standard Chartered Bank pledged yesterday to offer its banking services to help distribute aid funds.L’Oréal is expanding its programme to incorporate prevention information in its training of 1m hairdressers in beauty care.American Express, Nike, Armani and others launched the “Red” campaign this year to pledge profits from branded goods to HIV programmes for African women and children. Global Fund said Red had raised $10m and spent $1m in Rwanda.Booz Allen Hamilton, the consultants, said companies were shifting their view of Aids from a corporate social responsibility to a strategic business concern.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
748;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-05-01T18:16:59Z;Notebook;;Chelsea Football Club has launched a web portal that will give its fans access to independent financial advice.The Premiership champions have proved themselves very able at winning football matches this season, but what insights can they provide for their supporters on monetary matters?Getting rich the Chelsea way could be interpreted as buying a major oil company off an old friend in the government and then flogging it a few years later for an enormous profit. But presumably this kind of financial planning is beyond the reach of most fans.Given the business ambitions of the club, which wants to overtake Manchester United as the wealthiest British football team, Chelsea will no doubt need to branch out into more commercial services.When it does, perhaps it should consider capitalising on its owner’s knowledge of the energy sector.Never mind acquiring new players, Roman Abramovich should set his sights on a successful takeover bid for Centrica.The injury to Wayne Rooney’s metatarsal bone may be a serious setback to England’s World Cup hopes, but it is a commercial nightmare for Nike.The US footwear company had been banking on the Manchester United striker to help lift sales of its soccer boots during this summer’s tournament.Rooney’s injury, similar to that which hindered David Beckham in the last World Cup, is bad news for other sports shoe makers, since it has put all sorts of lightweight football boots in a bad light.In business, however, there is no such thing as a problem, only opportunities. Step forward Clarks, purveyors of sensible footwear.Not only are Clarks’ shoes renowned for being good for your feet, but they are as English as morris dancing and a cup of tea. Just the thing to satisfy the nationalistic demands of many England fans.Like so many posh people, David Cameron appears to like the idea of saving the planet more than the reality of doing something about it.Can it really be that much of a trial to get a couple of panniers for your bike rather than paying the chauffeur to ferry your briefcase and brogues around behind you in the back of the Lexus?And why, if the Tory leader cares so much about preventing further melting of the polar ice cap, does he add thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere flying up to see it? Such basic political gaffes make New Labour, for all its faults, look like the masters of joined-up government.If Mr Cameron wants to make symbolic gestures to the green movement, why has he not taken the simple step of changing his party’s flaming torch logo?Surely that cauldron of fossil fuels cannot be right for a party that wants people to make less use of the internal combustion engine. What New Conservatives need is a wind turbine to blow them towards an election victory.Mr Cameron might also be interested in the new plans to transform the Elephant and Castle complex in south London into a self-sustainable development, complete with its own well and power station.Surely this is the sort of environmental action that ticks all Mr Cameron’s boxes. It is a private sector initiative, creating green action in the centre of a city.Could there be a better suited location for a new Conservative party headquarters?Controversial foreign appointments are not the sole preserve of the English Football Association as Jack McConnell, Scotland’s first minister, proved this week when he named Donald Trump, colourful New York business tycoon, as an ambassador for Scotland.The Donald, as he is known in Manhattan, at first seems an unlikely choice, not least because he visited Scotland only to open a golf course – something the country would seem to have quite enough of already.However, he does share some of the characteristics of those other professional Scots, pop legend Rod Stewart and the honourable member for Marbella South, Sean Connery.All three men are noted for sporting some extraordinary hairdos, hanging out with gorgeous women and not living in Scotland.Who will Mr McConnell appoint next to serve in his tartan army? Bruce Forsyth, your time has come.
749;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-04-14T16:10:41Z;Solid gold mystery awaits the final whistle;;Years ago in London I met a man who worked for an auction house. He had something to tell me. Over steak sandwiches in a pub in the West End he unfolded a real-life detective story about the greatest prize in sport: the original football World Cup, the Jules Rimet trophy.People think it was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and melted down into gold bars. But according to my friend, the trophy was still alive and well and had recently been sold in London.The French football official Jules Rimet commissioned the trophy from the French sculptor Abel Lafleur for the first World Cup in 1930. It was a magnificent piece: a solid gold 15in statuette of Nike, then still known as the Greek goddess of victory. My friend the auctioneer’s story began in March 1966, when Nike was stolen from a stamp exhibition in London.At the time, England was preparing to host the 1966 World Cup. The theft made the English Football Association (FA) look stupid worldwide. But on the night of Sunday March 27, 1966, a dog named Pickles unearthed the stolen trophy under some bushes in south London. Pickles became a national hero.After the cup was returned, the FA gave it for safekeeping to its regular jeweller, George Bird. Martin Atherton, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire who has brilliantly tracked the trophy’s travails, describes how in the months before the World Cup Bird would cycle the trophy around London from exhibition to exhibition. The Jules Rimet sat in his bicycle basket, concealed only by a cloth.Eventually Bird decided that this wasn’t safe. He suggested to the FA that he make a replica of the trophy: safer to exhibit this than the real thing. Atherton describes what happened next. The FA asked Fifa, the international football authority, for permission to produce a replica. Fifa said no. But the FA secretly commissioned Bird anyway. He made a gilded bronze trophy – probably for nothing, as a gift to the FA. Now there were two Jules Rimet trophies: the real one and the replica, identical to the layman’s eye.On Saturday July 30, 1966, three policemen drove to Wembley for the World Cup final between England and West Germany. In the car with them were both Jules Rimet trophies. After England beat the Germans 4-2, Queen Elizabeth handed the English captain Bobby Moore the real trophy. Later, England’s midfielder Nobby Stiles performed his famous jig on the pitch with it. Then, however, the policemen wrested the cup from Stiles and gave him the replica instead. The British authorities wanted to keep the real trophy safe. That evening, on the balcony of the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, the English players waved the replica to the crowds. Nobody noticed the difference.In 1970 came the next World Cup, in Mexico. Now the FA had to return the trophy to Fifa. But which trophy? There were two. And so, my friend the auctioneer said, “They gave back the replica.”In Mexico, Brazil won its third World Cup and was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet trophy forever. A very different cup was sculpted to replace it. In 1983 the Jules Rimet was stolen from the Brazilian FA’s headquarters. Police believe it was melted down into gold bars. “But the stolen trophy wasn’t the real one,” said my friend. “It was the replica.” One of the two Jules Rimet trophies had stayed in London after 1970, hidden under Bird’s bed. Atherton explains: “It officially did not exist and so could not be put on open display.” Sometimes Bird’s grandchildren played with it. Twice his house was burgled, and twice the thieves missed the cup.Bird died in 1995. Two years later, his family auctioned his trophy. “Replica”, states the Sotheby’s catalogue for the sale. “Reserve price £20,000-£30,000.” That seemed a lot to ask for a bronze artefact with a scrap metal value of perhaps £1,500.But it sold for £254,500. This was nine times the highest price ever previously paid at auction for a piece of football memorabilia. Bird’s family was so astonished they walked out of the auction during the bidding. “It’s an absurd price,” my friend told me. “Unless you know it’s the real trophy. And the winning bidder knew.”The winning bidder was Fifa itself. One of the rival bidders was probably the Brazilian FA. Fifa had bid because it had heard the story of the switch: the story that the real cup had remained in England in 1970. “Fifa took the decision to buy this trophy as it was thought to be the original one,” Fifa confirmed to me last week. But even Fifa wasn’t sure whether the trophy at auction was indeed the real golden cup, or merely the bronze replica. Fifa couldn’t have ascertained this at the viewing days before the sale, a jewellery specialist at a leading auction house told me, because it’s not done to turn up at viewing days with testing equipment to check whether an object is solid gold. Fifa’s purchase of the cup was a gamble.Immediately after buying the trophy it had an expert examine it. You can imagine the scene: a backroom, a couple of football officials, a jeweller with an eyeglass and the trophy. And then the jeweller must have broken the news: the trophy wasn’t the real World Cup, but a cheap gilded bronze replica.Both my friend the auctioneer and Fifa had been wrong: the switch never happened. Expecting to snag the real Jules Rimet, Fifa had blown £254,500 on a fake. It has since lent the thing to Britain’s National Football Museum in Preston, in north-west England.One question remains: Where is the real Jules Rimet trophy? Was it really melted down into gold bars, or is it now hidden away under some Latin American bed?simonkuper-ft@hotmail.com

Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping season.Microsoft ended the week 1.8 per cent lower at $27.01 while shares in computer makers Gateway and Hewlett-Packard fell 1.7 per cent to $2.38 and 2.9 per cent to $33.17 respectively.Dell, which said on Tuesday it expected sales growth to outpace the wider market as a result of expansion in Asia, bucked the falling trend. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $30.06 on the week.Google shares also made progress, rallying 7.7 per cent to $365.80 after Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, said it would add the internet search group to its benchmark S&P 500 index.Demand for Google surged as fund managers whose strategies rely on tracking the benchmark index rushed to add the stock to their portfolios.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo gained 5.7 per cent to $31.77 after UBS upgraded the stock on valuation grounds.Lucent Technology rose 5.5 per cent to $3.06 on the week after the telecommunications equipment maker confirmed that it was in merger talks with Alcatel, of France.

Caterpillar rose 2.5 per cent to $76.21 and Honeywell gained 0.9 per cent to $42.66.The gains took the Dow 0.7 per cent higher at 11,317.43, while the broader S&P 500, buoyed by gains in energy stock climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,305.04. The Nasdaq Composite turned around earlier losses to trade 0.4 per cent higher at 2,303.35.Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders rose. Morgan Stanley, which topped analyst expectations with its 17 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, jumped 2.5 per cent to $61.94, while JPMorgan added 1.9 per cent to $41.99.Pharmaceutical stocks also moved broadly higher after drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb settled a key patent dispute with Canadian generic drugmaker Apotex.The deal, which would allow Bristol to retain patent protection on its blockbuster Plavix blood thinning treatment until 2011, prompted rating upgrades from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan.Bristol shares shot up 10.6 per cent to $25.24, while Eli Lilly ended the session 2.1 per cent higher at $58.49.Overall, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology index rose 1.2 per cent to become the second-best performing industry group on the S&P.By contrast, technology stocks were under pressure, with Microsoft sliding 2.1 per cent to $27.15 after it announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year.Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping
season.Shares in Hewlett-Packard slid 0.5 per cent to $33.36 while Gateway slumped 2.8 per cent to $2.36. Apple Computer, which does not use the Windows operating system, also got caught in the the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $61.67 after having risen by as much as 1.5 per cent earlier in the day.Losses on the Nasdaq were pared by Chaparral Steel, which surged 16.5 per cent to $57.50 following a strong quarterly earnings report. The robust figures set off a buying spree on metal makers. US Steel jumped 4.4 per cent to $59.86 while Alcoa gained 0.8 per cent to $29.36.On the earnings front, Nike and FedEx both exceeded analysts’ expectations with their earnings. Nike rose 2.2 per cent to $86.82 while FedEx gained 1.1 per cnet to $114.44."
752;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-03-22T00:09:45Z;Nike profits rise despite challenges;;"Nike, the world’s largest athletic-shoe company, on Tuesday reported better than expected third-quarter earnings as robust sales in its core US market helped offset challenges in Europe and Japan.US sales rose 14 per cent to $1.4bn, spurred by demand for new footwear styles such as the $160 Air Max 360 running shoe and the Air Jordan XXI and Kobe Bryant signature models.While Nike is faring well in the US, it faces pressure in Europe and Japan. Sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell 5.2 per cent while revenues in the Asia-Pacific market rose 13 per cent.In Europe, Nike has had to contend with a series of difficulties: the weak macro-economic environment, especially high unemployment in Germany and France, the shift among consumers and retailers to low-profile footwear, and fierce discounting of its products.Nike’s closely watched global futures orders, an indicator of growth based on estimates of product orders, rose 2.9 per cent compared with a year ago, or 5.4 per cent, excluding the impact of currency changes. Futures orders are for delivery from March through to July.By region, futures orders for the US increased 6 per cent; Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell 2 per cent; Asia-Pacific grew 5 per cent and the Americas rose 10 per cent.Nike’s gross margin narrowed 50 basis points to 43.6 per cent from 44.1 per cent a year ago. The decline reflected lower footwear margins, due to increases in the price of oil, and higher discounts in Europe and Asia, the company said.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell to 30.1 per cent of sales from 31.3 per cent.Net income rose 19 per cent to $325.8m, or $1.24 a share, compared with $273.4m, or $1.01 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.10 a share.Sales increased 9 per cent to $3.6bn from $3.3bn.The results are Nike’s first since Mark Parker was appointed chief executive, replacing William Perez who resigned over differences with Philip Knight, founder and chairman. Mr Parker said he was “very pleased” with the results."
753;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-03-20T18:23:09Z;Nike out of step with ‘low-profile’ shoes trend;;In the shoe industry they are known as “low-profile”, “fusion” or “lifestyle” shoes. But to consumers, they are simply trendy styles that look like trainers but perform like slippers.The style – epitomised by brands such as Puma, Skechers and Adidas – is the biggest trend in the shoe industry. And Nike, the world’s largest footwear brand, is starting to take notice.Usually a trendsetter, Nike now has to play catch-up. John Shanley, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said the footwear giant was “two to two-and-a-half years” behind the trend. “It had to do with the company’s historical emphasis on technical footwear,” he said.Many low-profile shoes resemble the silhouette of a running shoe but generally do not have technical features such as arch support or cushioning.Matthew Serra, chief executive of Foot Locker, the world’s largest retailer of athletic shoes and apparel, last week told investors Nike was “aggressively” getting into the category. “There is no question the low-profile trend is right now the driving trend in the business,” he said.The reason low-profile shoes are in the spotlight is because consumers in Europe and Japan, where Nike is not faring as well, are eschewing higher-priced “marquee” shoes ($100 a pair and up), in favour of the more moderately priced, low-profile styles. Nike dominates sales of shoes in the higher price range.In Europe, weak demand for Nike’s marquee footwear has led many retailers to heavily discount its products.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, said Nike was stepping up its “lifestyle offering” but that it might take some time to gain traction in the market. “If Nike pulls the trigger on low-profile now they won’t totally miss the trend,” she said.The company itself is more upbeat. A spokeswoman said: “We have seen a great deal of success in Europe with our metro low-profile shoes such as the Shox Rival, Sprint Sister and Zoom Blazer. These shoes are part of the sports culture series of product we have started to launch around the world and we have seen great success in this category.”In Japan, Nike’s business has suffered due to lower-price competition from Adidas and Asics, better product offering from Asics and the strong move to low-profile products, which is not a strength of its Japanese footwear merchandise mix, analysts said.The US, however, is a different story.Demand for marquee products – such as Air Jordans, the best-selling shoe brand ever – remains robust, even as consumers flock to the more affordable low-profile styles.Margaret Mager, analyst at Goldman Sachs, told clients: “Competitively we believe Nike has never been stronger in the US.”Jeffrey Edelman, analyst at UBS, said in a report that “the low-profile look continues to grow in popularity in the US”, but Nike “remains under-penetrated in this category in all geographic regions”.Analysts hope Nike will touch on its plans to tackle the low-profile trend when it reports third-quarter results on Wednesday, its first earnings under its new chief executive, Mark Parker.
754;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Warning on US ports? productivity;;The US must increase investment in its congested transport infrastructure and sharply raise productivity at its ports or risk being overwhelmed by surging imports from Asia, industry leaders say.?Every aspect of the supply chain is stretched,? Doug Tilden, chief executive of Marine Terminals, a port operator, told the Financial Times. ?It?s not a question of whether [a congestion crisis] is going to happen. It?s a question of when.?The US needed to add capacity equal to the Port of New York and New Jersey every year to cope with a projected doubling in import volume by 2025, he said, but there was no sign of that happening.Mr Tilden was among executives from freight carriers, port operators and transportation users at a conference on trans-Pacific trade in Long Beach, California, last week who pointed to China?s rapid expansion to highlight deficiencies in the US.While China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into new infrastructure to support soaring exports, the ageing US transport system is failing to keep pace, they said.US transport users have been warning about congestion since 2004, when large backlogs formed at the country?s ports and railway terminals during the peak shipping months before Christmas.The situation improved last year after ports and railway operators hired thousands of additional workers. But the system will face renewed pressure over the next few years as infrastructure approaches full capacity.Railway speeds are still slowing in spite of more investment?in the network?and truck companies cannot hire enough drivers to absorb the barrage of goods.The country?s largest Pacific ports, in southern California, are in urban areas with little room to grow, while environmental regulations and hostile local communities restrict expansion elsewhere.According to Brian Maher, chairman of Maher Terminals, a port operator, public opposition to infrastructure expansion had widened from the Nimby (?not in my back yard?) mentality to a new acronym: Banana (?build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything?).And John Isbell, director of logistics for Nike, the sportswear manufacturer, has complained that the US has no coherent federal transportation policy: ?The CEOs of corporate America need to go to Washington DC and get them focused on freight.?Nike has joined other big importers in an organisation called the Waterfront Coalition to lobby for more funding and political support for infrastructure improvements.Productivity is another key concern.Ron Widdows, chief executive of APL, a shipping company, said productivity at southern Californian ports was half that of Hong Kong and Singapore.?The biggest single issue we face is that we?re not very efficient,? said Mr Tilden. ?We can build our way out of trouble, but that is problematic because of environmental issues, so the best solution is increased productivity.?He predicted serious congestion would strike US ports by 2008.
755;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-03-02T18:30:58Z;Limping Reebok hinders Adidas;;Adidas, the German sporting goods group, on Thursday underlined the perils of its $3.8bn purchase of Reebok as it warned that sales at the US unit would continue to tumble this year, depressing profitability.Herbert Hainer, chief executive of the industry’s second-largest group behind Nike, said much of Adidas’s focus would be on turning round the struggling US brand.“We knew full well that an acquisition of this size would take a lot of work and that Reebok had some particular challenges ahead of it,” Mr Hainer said. A turnround would “take time”.Adidas’s shares declined the most among blue chips in Germany, sinking 6 per cent on the news. Acquisitions in the industry have often proved unsuccessful, such as Adidas’s 1997 purchase of ski maker Salomon, which it sold last year after a long restructuring.“There are clear challenges ahead with Reebok. Its brand profile is just not sharp enough and they had a lack of innovative products, but Adidas is working hard on it,” said Andreas Inderst, analyst at ABN Amro.He and many other analysts are betting that short-term problems for Adidas will turn into opportunities from 2007 onwards, as synergies from the acquisition materialise. Mr Hainer said: “We are in there for the long term.”Reebok’s sales decreased 5 per cent last year. Adidas said it expected a similar decline for this year following a 22 per cent fall in orders in the last quarter.Overall, Adidas’s operating margin will fall from 10.7 per cent last year to about 9 per cent in 2006. This is largely a result of Reebok, but also due to higher marketing spending on the football World Cup, which is boosting the German group’s sales and orders.Adidas will unveil its strategy for Reebok in April – nearly a year after it announced the acquisition – but elements of it are clear.Adidas intends to use its strong position in Europe and Asia to boost Reebok, which it intends to keep as a performance brand. Adidas could also take over some of Reebok’s marketing portfolio in the US, where it sponsors the NFL American football and NBA basketball leagues.Adidas slipped to a net loss of €4m ($4.8m) from a €20m profit in the fourth quarter largely due to costs from integrating Reebok. Analysts at WestLB said this quarter accounted for less than 1 per cent of Adidas’s total profitability.In a recent interview in carmaker Audi’s annual report, Mr Hainer said that he saw the potential for both Adidas and Reebok brands at nearly double their current levels by 2015. Adidas should have sales of at least €10bn, up from €5.6bn last year, and Reebok should make at least €5bn, up from the €2.8bn estimated for the last 11 months of this year.
756;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-02-24T16:30:15Z;One in a billion;;"Few subjects must seem as vast and daunting for an author as China. The country has more than 30 provinces, some 650 cities, and of course, that mesmerising 1.3 billion people. Jonathan Spence’s The Chan’s Great Continent: China in Western Minds, published in the late 1990s, reminds us that Marco Polo among others made errors and exaggerations in his narrative of China. Generations of westerners since have also been baffled by what holds this huge country together, coming to all kinds of contradictory conclusions.One temptation for writers is to duck the guessing game about China’s prospects for global economic domination or democracy and instead take on a more manageable slice. Even this sensible approach usually comes with disclaimers. Carl Crow’s 1937 book 400 Million Customers begins with one, even though the author spent decades in the country. More than half a century on, Peter Hessler’s entertaining and wise account, River Town, about two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in a town on the Yangtze, started with the proviso: “This isn’t a book about China. It’s about a certain small part of China at a certain brief period in time.”It’s almost as if authors feel that to tackle the whole country is impossible. So it’s not surprising that three recent books take a bite-sized approach to China. Rachel DeWoskin’s Foreign Babes in Beijing is about the author’s experience moonlighting as an actress on a steamy soap opera on Chinese television. The public relations executive uses this episode as a prism through which to look at the country in the mid-1990s. One Billion Customers, by journalist turned businessman James McGregor, offers plenty of lessons, from Morgan Stanley’s problematic first joint venture in the country to Dow Jones and Reuters’ battles with the government after the state news agency, Xinhua, tried to grab their customers. Brook Larmer’s Operation Yao Ming is a biography of the 7ft 6in Chinese basketball star, but it is probably better characterised as a book about, well, just about everything: individual freedoms bump up against the Chinese state, the country’s huge sporting ambitions and attempts by Nike, Reebok and the US basketball league to carve out a new market. Larmer’s important book is a classic example of the microcosmic approach that delivers, in pointillist style, a sweeping panorama of China: Yao’s mother, for instance, turns out to have been a sadistic Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution. His mother and father, two basketball stars who were forced into the sports system against their will, were coaxed to marry in the hope that they might produce a “genetic marvel”.DeWoskin’s Foreign Babes in Beijing is the slightest of the three books, with plenty of cross-cultural confusion. After she accedes to the director’s request for more passion and gamely claws at her co-star’s back, she overhears another director whispering, “You see what I mean? Foreign babes are tigers.” “Funny,” DeWoskin writes, “I had always thought that was a stereotype of Eastern women.”This is mildly entertaining for a while, but you begin to wonder if making bold premises about China from a TV soap is a bit like balancing a continent-sized country on a stiletto. And DeWoskin’s expatriate whines, which include the difficulty of getting iceberg lettuce in China, can be a little tedious. When DeWoskin sees a banner that reads “Marry Chritmas” she wonders: “It is mysterious that Chinese organisations so rarely ask one of the hundred thousand Americans living there to proofread banners.” I mean, really.James McGregor’s book, by contrast, is informed by a decade and a half of life in Beijing. The acknowledgments at the end of the volume merit an Olympian record; five pages of names lie hugger-mugger like a phone book. McGregor knows a lot of people - and he wants us to know it too. These multitudinous sources result in good details about subjects ranging from Rupert Murdoch’s efforts to rehabilitate his reputation in China to the country’s efforts to extradite Lai Changxing, a peasant turned tycoon accused of smuggling, after he was arrested in Ontario. A Canadian official tells McGregor: “They never, never, never got it that we could not interfere in our own court system, that we could not force the outcome, right up to Zhu Rongji [China’s well-regarded former premier]. It was beyond their comprehension.”China is the world’s biggest start-up and the world’s biggest turnaround, says McGregor - with all the problems you might expect from that dysfunctional hybrid status. McGregor can be refreshingly blunt: large sections of the powerful in China behave like a “thugocracy”, he says, because “decades of social chaos, political purges and wrenching Maoist manipulation created a government operating culture in which bludgeoning your opponent into submission and then taking the spoils is a way of life”.Every chapter ends with his own take-off of Mao’s doctrinal Red Book; a Baedeker for doing business in China. But McGregor is at his best describing how he fought back with everything at his disposal when the Chinese news agency Xinhua - playing both the role of regulator and competitor - made a grab for the $35m financial news and data businesses Reuters and Dow Jones had built. In discussions McGregor repeats the same question over and over again until one of the government officials loses his temper - what the team’s Chinese lawyer colourfully described as an “iron-ass strategy” to negotiating. “Chinese people grow up enduring non-stop speeches from teachers and endless propaganda lectures. They can tolerate endless nonsense. Foreigners often become impatient. It’s best when negotiating to develop an oratorical loop that you can politely repeat time after time while sitting in your chair for hours. He who breaks first loses,” McGregor writes.I was reading his book on a week-long trip to Shanghai during which the friends I was staying with happened to be embroiled in a similar circular argument with the tax authorities, who were querying a definition of profits in business accounts that the government had signed off on years earlier, eventually asking them to go back to their office and write a Maoist-style self-criticism.So it goes in 21st century China, where officials redraw boundaries to suit their needs and entrepreneurs and citizens try to step around them. Everywhere I went that week in Shanghai it was hard not to miss examples of a state-led economy being tugged in every direction by entrepreneurs, not to mention government officials with blank cheques. Each floor of the 1930s building I was staying in was bathed in a pervasive gloom except for the landing on which a woman had decided to run a beauty parlour in the corridors outside her flat, leaving her neighbours to step around women in curlers. At a Yo-Yo Ma recital, touts waved tickets at arm’s length from policemen. And the headlines in the foreign press that week were of a mysterious rogue copper trader at a Chinese state-owned company who had gone underground. I arrived at a newly built tennis stadium for the prestigious eight-man year-end Masters to find that the Chinese government had built facilities so large that they could have accommodated a tournament the size of Wimbledon on the 80-acre site. (A Hong Kong economist recently estimated that this penchant for building bigger, better and above all more of everything saw fixed investment in industries experiencing overcapacity account for nearly a half of China’s GDP growth in 2005.)Brook Larmer’s riveting tale brings all these different strands of Chinese life together. The story of Yao Ming shows how one man’s life has been transformed by opportunities that would have been unimaginable a couple of decades ago. This is a tale of social engineering bordering on quackery as much as sport. At the age of 12 - when he was already nearly 6ft 2in - Yao and other young basketballers were subjected to the ordeal of having their testicles cupped and measured by doctors behind the doors of the “Talent Selection Office”. Even Aldous Huxley would have had difficulty thinking this up: “The idea, Chinese scientists say, is to determine how quickly an athlete is passing through puberty - and to calculate how many years of growth remain.” Larmer’s narrative of China’s sporting aspirations - and the sports industry’s ambitions in China - features Yao Ming as an occasionally hapless Hamlet in a drama scripted by other people. The book is unputdownable and as full of business lessons for those operating in China as McGregor’s.As so often in McGregor’s book, hardball goes a long way towards achieving success for Yao Ming and his advisers. These examples overturn the idea that Chinese officialdom must be dealt with differently because its officials get offended all too easily - the notion of “preserving face”. Yao Ming and his rag-tag team of advisers, including a twenty-something Chinese-American MBA student from the University of Chicago and his business school assistant dean, have to stand firm when Chinese basketball officials try to browbeat them into accepting a new agent for the sportsman. At one point in the saga Yao courageously writes to the authorities: “My family and I will resist any attempt to infringe upon our inalienable rights of exercising free will.” Astonishingly, he gets to keep the agent of his choice.When Chinese Basketball Association officials are subjecting the Houston Rockets to a slow death at the negotiating table before they allow the team to choose Yao Ming as the NBA’s prestigious first pick, the Rockets’ general counsel delivers an ultimatum: “If we don’t draft Yao, everyone will know there’s a problem with the Chinese government - and Yao’s stock will plummet. He might not even get drafted. You don’t want that to happen, do you?” Still, the price Yao agreed to pay his home team, the Shanghai Sharks, to be allowed to play in the NBA was extortionate - $8m to $15m over the course of his career. The brinkmanship could have backfired; another promising contemporary, Wang Zhizhi, sees his star fall after he lands on the wrong side of the Chinese government.These three books leave little doubt about the audacious ambition of Chinese entrepreneurs and government officials. In the first decades after Deng Xioaping decided to open the economy in the late 1970s, many business people fell over themselves trying to make allowances for different cultural sensitivities and different development trajectories. These books suggest there is now a need for hard-headed realism. “Nothing about ‘face’ is particular to Chinese culture or physiology,” notes DeWoskin in Foreign Babes.As frustration over intellectual property violations rises once again, a US trade official recently argued that China could no longer be treated as an apprentice when considering its responsibilities as a member of the World Trade Organisation. The compromises made by Yahoo, Google and Microsoft on freedom of expression in China have also brought calls for western companies to stand up to the government.But, as a Nike manager puts it in Operation Yao Ming, China will probably retain the upper hand: “You see starry-eyed foreigners coming in here dreaming about making millions. But there are many more Chinese thinking: ‘If I can just scalp one gullible foreigner, I’ll have it made.’ Frankly, I think the Chinese will always have the better odds. They have the home-field advantage.” Like all large and powerful countries, China is self-interested, opportunistic and ambitious - only more so. McGregor quotes a Qing dynasty aphorism that is probably still management gospel from Beijing to Guangzhou: “Make the past serve the present, make the foreign serve China.”Rahul Jacob is a former Hong Kong bureau chief of the Financial Times.ONE BILLION CUSTOMERS: Lessons From the Front Lines of Doing Business in China

757;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-02-13T20:27:51Z;Wake up to old-fashioned power of new oligopolies;;"What will it take to wake us up to the ever-tightening grip of oligopolies over ever more of our global marketplaces? Even though their power increasingly warps our production systems, and our free market systems, alarms are rare and fleeting.The collapse of an overly consolidated US flu vaccine system two years ago did not set off any bells. Nor did the revelation, by experts studying the potential impact of an avian flu pandemic on commerce, of deep fragilities in our hyper-rationalised medical and food supply systems. The mega-merger of Procter & Gamble and Gillette last year did not do it. Nor did the general consolidation of food processors; in the US, 10 groups account for half of all retail sales, with single companies often capturing more than 75 per cent of particular product markets. Neither the fact that Wal-Mart controls 30 per cent of sales for many goods in the US economy, nor that four companies account for 94 per cent of UK supermarket sales, seem to concern policymakers.What about Samsung’s effort to capture world markets for liquid crystal display screens and D-Ram computer chips? Or Tokyo’s rewriting of antitrust laws to allow companies to consolidate 100 per cent monopolies over key technologies? Or the capture of 60 per cent of the global sneaker market by Nike and Adidas? In every case, there has been almost no reaction. Mittal Steel’s play for Arcelor may not be a global-scale problem, as the two companies combined account for only 10 per cent of the world steel market. But what of the fact that three companies account for 75 per cent of global iron ore production?There is no shortage of competition in many markets. Just ask Volkswagen or Delta Airlines. But the further down we look below the level of branded companies, the more consolidation we tend to find. This is true in commodities, services, industrial components and shipping. Many executives and investors do understand what is happening, and recognise the stakes. In a recent article for McKinsey & Co, one consultant wrote of the rise of “global mega-institutions”. Although the writer did not refer to these as oligo­polies, he described their character well. Not only, he wrote, have these companies developed “extraordinary scale and scope”, but they capture “disproportionately high profits”. It seems that only the citizen and politician remain in the dark. The global corporate endgame is well under way, and none of our societies is prepared for it, intellectually or institutionally.It is not as if we need to search long for evidence of the problems traditionally associated with monopoly. Capture of political power? Consider Boeing’s hold over the Bush administration. Extreme pricing distortions? We see them throughout Wal-Mart’s supply system. Artificial control over what technologies are brought to market and when? One blatant example is the power over renewable energy systems of British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell. Extreme profiteering? America’s big energy companies have not only resurrected the art of gouging the consumer, they have raised it to a new state of perfection.As bad as these old-fashioned problems may be, many of our 21st-century global oligopolies appear to pose entirely new dangers. This is due largely to how power is exercised in systems characterised by extreme
outsourcing. Alfred D. Chandler, an industrial scholar, has written that
one of the main factors behind the
rise of the huge, vertically integrated corporation early in the 20th century was enforcement of US antitrust
law, which limited the horizontal growth of these companies. Unable to exert power over the market, many scrambled instead to internalise key functions, for competitive advantage.This means we cannot ignore the effect on global industrial organisation of the radical relaxation of antitrust enforcement by the Reagan administration in 1981. One result of giving big companies a licence to grow horizontally was that many producers, once they captured control over their markets, opted to sell off or shut down expensive and risky manufacturing and research and development operations and buy these “services” from outside suppliers with few or no other pathways to the marketplace. Over time, many of these top-tier companies relied ever more on their power to dictate prices to their suppliers (including workers) to capture profits.The increasing power of a few leading trade-oriented companies over entire production and supply systems results in a variety of economic and political ills. One is the degradation of many production systems themselves. That is what happens when the actual producers of goods or components are unable to capture a sufficient share of revenue to support innovation, or sometimes even to maintain existing machinery and workforces. Another is the heightening of competition within society as opposed to between leading companies. In a production system marked by extreme outsourcing,
oligopoly does not result in the end of competition so much as the redirection of competition downwards, as lead companies capture more power to set supplier against supplier, community against community and worker against worker.It is here we find at least a partial explanation for one of the more confusing paradoxes of today’s global system – the simultaneous rise in consolidation and competition. So far, especially in America, the tendency has been to blame extreme competition on “globalisation”, not least because faulting foreigners for domestic ills can be a good way to sell books and win votes. The real explanation, however, is not only globalisation, or even mainly globalisation, as much as radical changes in the structure of industry. In other words, it is not the Chinese who destroy US and European jobs, but roll up by the world’s largest traders and retailers of the power to pit producer against producer, and to capture most or all of the gain from the arbitrage.Outright monopoly is absolutely defensible – when granted temporarily to reward companies for bringing truly new ideas to market. But most of today’s powerful companies are not the result of new ideas, only the strategic reordering of markets. If anything, their goal is the oldest one in commerce – to fence in the place where deals are done, and to tax producers and consumers for the right to meet there. It will not be long until we realise that to save our free market system will require, among other actions, far more aggressive enforcement of antitrust. Simply stopping any further roll out of power will not be enough. True believers in the free market will admit there is no other choice than to roll the power back.The writer, senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is author of End of the Line, The Rise and Coming Fall of the Global Corporation (Doubleday)"
758;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-02-12T16:35:44Z;Adidas plots Reebok brand;;Adidas, the German sporting goods company that recently acquired US rival Reebok, plans to reposition Reebok as a performance brand, said Herbert Hainer, Adidas?s chief executive.While Adidas is known for engineering athletic shoes ? last year it launched Adidas I, a $250 high-tech wonder dubbed ?the world?s first intelligent shoe? ? Reebok has emphasised casual footwear.Endorsement deals with rappers Jay-Z and 50 Cent have given the Reebok brand broad appeal among the more fashion-conscious urban consumers.Speaking by satellite to a strategic footwear forum hosted by the World Shoe Association, Mr Hainer said: ?There is no doubt that we will position Reebok back more to a performance brand than it has been over the last two to three years. Reebok was one of the first to bring a lot of technology into the market.?Mr Hainer reiterated Adidas and Reebok would maintain separate brand identities. ?We will keep the two brands separate, because we believe both have their own identity, heritage and consumer base,? he said.Rob Langstaff, president of Adidas America, said the company viewed Reebok as ?sibling rivalry?, adding: ?We want to compete at the marketplace?.?.?.?and both of us will become better as a result.?US sales of athletic footwear rose just 2.8 per cent in 2005 to $11.5bn, according to the NPD Group. The challenge for Adidas and rival Nike is to find ways to increase revenue in a mature market.Mr Hainer said growth in the athletic footwear market would come from a combination of fashion and technology: ?Innovative, technologically driven product really can make a difference in the US market. If you bring new technology, new innovative product to the market, the consumer is ready to spend the money.?Over the coming months Adidas and Nike will go head-to-head as they compete to sell products related to the World Cup.
759;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Wal-Mart picks a shade of green;;"When Wal-Mart starts selling a line of organic cotton baby clothes in Europe and Japan later this year, the new products will account for just a fraction of its annual sales of about $300bn.But Wal-Mart’s embrace of organic products underlines the question now facing environmental activists and others who have pressed the company to change its business practices: is the world’s largest retailer setting off after Nike, Gap and others to embrace the cause of good corporate citizenship?The cotton initiative was cited by Lee Scott, chief executive, in a speech in October, in which he set out a dramatically new vision of Wal-Mart, long criticised for focusing on low prices at the expense of everything else.“What if we used our size and resource to make this country and this earth an even better place for all of us?” asked Mr Scott, as he announced targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and cutting waste. He also committed the company to working with its suppliers to promote good environmental practices.“That speech was the single most groundbreaking speech from the CEO of a major US company on the environment that I have ever heard,” says one
leading US environmental activist.Wal-Mart’s new strategy has thrown down a challenge to its social and environmentalist critics, who now have to decide to what extent they should engage with a company previously regarded by many as an irredeemable villain. Three months after the Scott speech, there is still a high level of scepticism.“My sense is that there
is a lot of concern that they are taking a piecemeal approach,” says David Waskow, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth’s Washington office. “People want to see more broad-based evidence of change.”The scepticism reflects Wal-Mart’s troubled record. In the US, the company has been repeatedly censured by the Environmental Protection Agency over waste water run-offs from its stores, which are cited as a factor encouraging urban sprawl. Activists say the company also traditionally supports congressional candidates with poor environmental records. It is facing a lawsuit alleging sex discrimination against its women workers, and last year it paid $11m to the justice department for allowing subcontractors to use undocumented immigrant labour.The company is also aggressively anti-union. The Scott speech came against the background of a bitter campaign against the retailer in the US led by labour unions, which has focused on the low-wage model and poor healthcare provision prevalent in the retail sector.“Environmentalists are cautious about applauding Wal-Mart’s commitments because we believe that the company is trying to isolate the labour movement,” says Michael Marx, head of
Corporate Ethics International, an environmental campaign group, noting that the unions are regarded by many environmentalists as important allies.Wal-Mart’s overall environmental strategy was drawn up with assistance from Conservation International, a non-profit environmental group that works closely with companies, which also provide 7 per cent of its overall funding.But for membership-based environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, and others that seek to work in coalition with student and labour campaigners, engaging with the biggest villain on the block presents risks of losing support and funds.In a sign of the distrust it faces, Wal-Mart has been unsuccessfully trying for a year to find a “senior director of stakeholder management”, a position that it says would “help pioneer a new model of how Wal-Mart works with outside stakeholders, resulting in fundamental changes in how the company does business”.Wal-Mart argues that its intentions are serious, and that the objective is improving its own business, rather than winning over its critics.“The more that we work with people, we see things we hadn’t seen before, and we become better as a company,” says Andy Ruben, the company vice-president who has been overseeing the sustainability drive for the past five months.“Over the past 18 months as we have continued to progress, there are people who are now willing to talk to us, who were not willing to talk to us 18 months ago.”The company, he says, has “dozens of people, or more” working in 13 “sustainability networks” covering areas such as farm products, seafood, wood and paper, and gold and jewellery, bringing together its buyers with suppliers and concerned non-profit groups.Last month it announced it would work to source all its wild-caught fish from sustainable fisheries certified by the Maritime Stewardship Council – joining a select group of US retailers headed by Whole Foods Market, the leading organic and natural food retailer.Mr Scott also argues that Wal-Mart’s size – it operates more than 3,000 stores in the US – means it can have a huge effect on suppliers’ standards, as well as on the development of new energy saving technology.Glenn Prickett of Conservation International argues that Wal-Mart can also contribute to improving industry standards: its work on shrimp certification, for example, led to broader rules on biodiversity and tighter standards from others in the environmental movement.“What’s exciting about Wal-Mart is the scale, and also the bigger reach they have into the public. You begin putting environmental ideas and offers in front of the US public...and in the long run that’s better for the environment.”Wal-Mart was the first general retailer in the US to set out specific targets on greenhouse gases. Its existing level of disclosure on its efforts to monitor workplace conditions in its supply chain remains far below standards set by Nike and Gap, but still goes beyond its main competitors, including Target, Costco and Kmart.“They are a large company that has a huge supply chain . . . if they change their practices they could set a standard for the industry, as well as for their own company, and it can have huge impact,” says Mindy Lubber of Ceres, a coalition of investors. She points to Nike’s moves to improve monitoring of its factory conditions, which contributed to a broader industry-wide effort.Environmentalists say a key test of Wal-Mart’s commitment will be its plans to release an initial environmental sustainability report in 2007, together with internet data that would be used to track its commitments on the reduction of waste and greenhouse gas production. Similar reports from corporations such as Hewlett-Packard and Ford include company-wide breakdowns of their output of pollutants and greenhouse gases.In the meantime, activists face the challenge of adapting to a world in which Wal-Mart still fails to meet their standards – for example, with its use of greenfield sites, anti-union policy in the US and business model based on low-cost consumption – but where it is no longer completely unresponsive to criticism.That is already leading to discussions between campaign groups on a significant change in strategy. The days of purely negative campaigning by labour groups may be numbered, in favour of a new mix of engagement and campaigning.‘Epiphany’ for a CEOWal-Mart faces a wide range of US critics, from labour unions and anti-sweatshop activists to groups who blame big-box retailers for feeding urban sprawl and traffic growth. “Everybody has a dog in this fight,” said one veteran corporate ethics campaigner.Both the UFCW grocery workers’ union – whose campaigns to unionise the retailer’s workers failed – and the SEIU service workers’ union have focused on mobilising this broad opposition.The unions and their allies scored a significant victory last month in Maryland, when the state assembly passed a law that would require the retailer to increase its healthcare contributions – an issue on which Wal-Mart itself recognises that it is vulnerable.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart chief executive, has presented the initiatives he announced in October as something of a personal epiphany following Hurricane Katrina, when the company proved more proficient than the government in delivering initial emergency supplies.“Katrina asked this question . . .what if we used our size and resources to make this country and this earth an even better place for all of us?” he said.Mr Scott suggested to investors in November 2004 that the company’s poor corporate reputation could eventually pose a threat to its growth in the US. He then launched extensive consultations with a range of non-profit groups.“Having heard these kind of speeches from corporations several times before, I’m a little sceptical,” says one experienced corporate social responsibility adviser. “Generally, companies take these steps only after pressure from their stakeholders...be it consumers, or investors, or activists. Not because they decided on their own it was the right thing to do.”"
760;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-01-30T22:51:56Z;World Cup offers investors a sporting chance;;"It’s a big question for many large companies but most sports fans do not care. Does commercial sponsorship of big sporting events yield any benefits to the corporations who are doing it?Official sponsors of this year’s soccer World Cup in Germany have paid up to €45m each for the privilege of becoming an official partner of the tournament and seeing their names beamed into billions of television sets around the world for a month.Now, thanks to a handful of investment products developed by JPMorgan, some investors in Germany and elsewhere will be at least as interested in the fortunes of the sponsors as in their national team.The investments will allow them to take a shot on whether the corporate sponsors will benefit from their participation.Distribution of the first of these products – a two-year note whose capital investment is guaranteed – begins in banks and savings institutions in Germany next week, and in Austria from February 13.It will allow investors to wager that eight of the 15 official partners of the World Cup will perform better on the stock market than their nearest competitors.The basket of sponsors comprises Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald’s, Deutsche Telekom, Fuji Photo Film, Adidas-Salomon, Continental and Yahoo.For investors to get an annual coupon above their guaranteed cash back, those eight companies will have to outperform their competitors who are not World Cup partners: PepsiCo, Heineken, Yum! Brands, Telecom Italia, Eastman Kodak, Nike, Goodyear Tire and Google.Daniel McNeill, a product structurer in the bank’s exotic and hybrids group, said the idea came from JPMorgan’s German marketing team, which wanted a locally themed product that added in World Cup sponsors.Mr McNeill’s team said they thought that a similar product could be sold more broadly to investors across Europe and beyond.JPMorgan has developed at least three other products that allow investors to bet on the Dax index of blue-chip German stocks, on the basis that the tournament will bring the country an economic boost, or on the performance of the eight tournament sponsors.However, in initial market soundings, the outperformance product appeared to be the favourite in Germany.JPMorgan bankers say it benefits from the association with the World Cup. But retail investors have also displayed preferences for shorter-maturity products in recent months and like the outperformance – or “alpha” – feature of the instrument.The products are structured using equity derivatives, from which JPMorgan makes its profit. Distributors are expected to take a commission of up to 1.5 per cent. The notes will be sold in minimum €1,000 denominations, but most retail investors are expected to invest up to €50,000.The coupons are subject to a cap of 12 per cent at the end of the first year and
24 per cent at the end of the second year.Though it has no retail distribution arm, JPMorgan has developed a significant business structuring retail products for the German and Austrian markets. Over the last four years, it has structured and sold about 300 separate products through retail banks there, its bankers say.But it is not the only bank trying to tap into World Cup fever. Other banks are getting in on the act too, with products that, for example, pay out rewards if the German stock market beats the Brazilian market over the course of the tournament, or the year."

Wal-Mart has also established “sustainability networks” that bring its suppliers and its buyers together with concerned non-profit groups, covering products including agricultural products, seafood, and gold and jewellery.Rupert Howes, head of the Marine Stewardship Council, said: “It is hugely significant that Wal-Mart is doing this, and setting a real example to the rest of the industry.”However, only a small number of fisheries have been certified as sustainable. This means it will take between three and five years for Wal-Mart to achieve its goal. The company has also been showing new interest in improving conditions in garment and footwear factories – another area highlighted by Mr Scott.But it is still struggling to persuade many of its critics that it is serious about its conversion to the cause of corporate social responsibility.It has been trying for a year to hire a senior director to coordinate relations with “stakeholder groups”, including activist and community groups, a job which it says will oversee the effort “to create a new model of business engagement that uses market-based changes to create societal value”.But there have been concerns about the authority of the new position, given the scope of the challenge facing the company - similar positions at Gap, Nike, Reebok and BP hold the higher rank of vice-president.However, David Schilling, of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibiity, which has co-ordinated numerous shareholder resolutions critical of Wal-Mart, said critics would watch for genuine changes that went beyond its current propaganda war.“If stakeholder engagement developes at a high level and is integrated into the way business decisions are made, then that will be a good indication that the company is beginning to turn the corner,” he said.Wal-Mart faces considerable challenges if it is to adapt its operations to the range of standards now embraced by some of its rivals. Unlike Nike or Gap, both of which have been active in developing supply chain monitoring, it sells a vast range of merchandise ranging from bananas to diamonds; its supply chain uses more than 7,000 factories worldwide for its own brand products alone, compared to around 700 at Nike."
762;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-01-23T23:24:51Z;Shares fall after Nike chief quits, citing split;;William Perez has resigned as chief executive of Nike after just 13 months at the helm of the world’s biggest sports shoe and clothing company, citing “differences” with Philip Knight, the group’s founder and chairman.Mark Parker, Nike brand co-president, was appointed president and chief executive following a board meeting on Friday. Nike’s shares fell 0.9 per cent to close at $83.45 in New York.Mr Knight said: “Succession at any company is challenging, and unfortunately the expectations that Bill and I and others had when he joined a year ago didn’t play out as we had hoped.”The changes come at a challenging time for the company. Nike faces increased competition from the pending merger of Adidas-Salomon and Reebok International and sluggish retail sales in Europe and Japan, its largest Asian market.John Shanley, senior footwear and athletic apparel analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said the announcement was unexpected. He said the company was in the middle of booking orders for the autumn season – “a crucial time”.Mr Perez’s appointment in December 2004 surprised investors and analysts. He was the first outsider to lead the company and had no experience in footwear or sports, having spent 34 years at SC Johnson, which produces Drano drain-cleaner and Ziploc plastic bags.But his appointment was seen as an important move for Nike as it pursued a multi-brand strategy aimed at shifting the Oregon-based company further away from its roots in sports performance shoes.In December, Mr Perez told Wall Street analysts that an “exhaustive” strategic review of the company had concluded that “for the most part we have the right game plan”.His comments came as Nike reported a 15 per cent rise in earnings, helped by strong growth in US sports shoe sales.But Mr Shanley said there had been some rumblings of disagreement between Mr Perez and other senior executives over issues such as Mr Perez’s desire to extend the Nike brand into more moderately priced products and his efforts to reach out to retailers.In a statement, Mr Perez said he and Mr Knight “weren’t entirely aligned on some aspects of how to best lead the company’s long-term growth”.He added: “It became obvious to me that the long-term interests of the company would be best served by my resignation.”Mr Knight on Monday said it had proved too much of a leap for Mr Perez to go from a packaged goods company to running a sporting goods business.Mr Parker, 50, joined Nike in 1979. Nike said he was “widely recognised as the product visionary for the Nike Air franchise and many other industry-leading product design and performance innovations”.Charlie Denson was named president of the Nike brand.
763;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-01-23T22:12:07Z;Lex: Nike;;Filling the shoes of an illustrious predecessor is risky at the best of times. It can be all the more uncomfortable when the co-founder still dominates the company. But few would have expected William Perez to get the boot after just over a year at the helm of Nike. His resignation, after disagreements with Philip Knight, Nike’s chairman, comes at an awkward time for the world’s largest maker of sports shoes.Its ubiquitous brand still accounts for more than 85 per cent of revenues, mostly thanks to a dominant position in athletic shoes priced above $100. That means high margins. It also leaves Nike exposed to anything that might damage the brand, from sweatshop allegations to the occasional gaffe by any of its celebrity endorsers. With about a third of the global sports shoe market, Nike’s potential for market share gains looks limited. And there is a limit to how many new shoes even the most passionate jogger needs.Hence the recent emphasis on developing other brands, as well as boosting its presence in areas such as soccer boots and kit.But it was precisely to bring about these changes that Mr Perez was hired. While he may have trodden on a few toes, it is hard to point to any specific stumbles under his watch.Nike, moreover, will eventually face an even tougher rival in Adidas-Reebok. Any setbacks in the integration phase might take Adidas’s eyes off the ball, but Nike might find it harder to benefit from such opportunities. With the shares trading at almost 16 times this year’s earnings, it is hard to see another winning streak any time soon.
764;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-01-23T20:48:38Z;Observer - Asia;;"Austria remains Haider-bound in EUIt was only a matter of time before Jörg Haider, the Austrian politician known for a fondness for the Nazis, resurfaced to haunt the country’s six-month presidency of the European Union.In 2000, Austria faced diplomatic isolation from Brussels after Wolfgang Schüssel, its bespectacled chancellor, formed a controversial coalition with Haider’s ultra-right Freedom party.Schüssel has been desperate to exorcise the scarring memory, playing the good European with ideas for euro taxes and a revamped constitution.The spectre at the feast returned at the weekend when Haider, elected governor of Carinthia province, invited EU employment and social affairs ministers to dinner.They were in the picturesque town of Villach, on his patch, for a routine meeting.Most made their excuses after the get-together, which ended on Friday night, scurrying off to pressing business and avoiding a politically sensitive encounter with Haider.About 300 people, many of whom got a handshake and photo with Haider, sat down to smoked fish and fillet of milk-fed veal at a palm-tree lined bash at an old brewery.Among them were Martin Bartenstein, lofty Austrian economy and labour minister and show-stealing star of the presidency so far; and Ursula Haubner, Austrian social security minister. That’s not so surprising: she is Haider’s sister.There’s little doubt in the City of London that Singapore’s PSA will this week announce a firm offer for P&O, the container ports and ferries group. Which day it will choose is a little less clear.But one straw in the wind has been little noticed. Next Monday and Tuesday there will be traditional Chinese new year celebrations in mainly Chinese Singapore.The PSA bosses in London for the bid are likely to be receiving anxious calls from home checking they will be back with their families for the start of the festivities this weekend. So Friday looks like a good day for the managers to be on their flights home. That makes Wednesday or Thursday good bets to see a bid to emerge.Nike’s slogan is “Just do it”. Even so, the world’s largest sports shoe company on Monday acted with incredible haste to remove traces of Bill Perez, ousted chief executive, from its website. A search for Perez’s bio yielded this message: “Sorry, the page you’ve requested does not exist.” Perez resigned from the home of the Swoosh-labelled shoes over “differences” with Phil Knight, Nike’s founder and board chairman, after just 13 months on the job.There is, however, one vestige of his tenure: an interview with Perez in the 2005 annual report. When asked how he felt he had surprised Nike, he said: “I think I was culturally aligned with Nike more than anybody expected other than Phil Knight. I think people probably expected me to take a longer time to get indoctrinated into the Nike culture, but I have felt at home here.”Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the exchequer, has a reputation for delivering lectures on sound economic management at the monthly Ecofin council of EU finance ministers.So his colleagues are wondering how he will he respond to Tuesday’s Ecofin, at which EU finance ministers will formally rap Brown over the knuckles for running an “excessive deficit”.The answer is that Brown simply won’t turn up. Observer hears he intends to send Dawn Primarolo, his deputy, to receive an ear-bashing about prudent book-keeping.It’s 20 years since Fritz Leutwiler, the legendary Swiss central bank governor, helped run the global economy as chairman of the Bank for International Settlements, but the small Alpine state appears to be making a comeback.Days after the appointment of Jean-Pierre Roth as the next BIS chairman, Philipp Hildebrand, one of the Swiss National Bank’s two other governors, has been elected to chair the Group of 10 deputies – the shadow committee that prepares meetings of the industrialised countries’ finance ministers.For much of the 1990s, Switzerland was in the doghouse, with its economy stalled and its holier than thou image tarnished by Nazi gold scandals. Now political steps have reduced Swiss isolation, and multinationals such as UBS, Novartis and Nestlé are among the biggest in Europe by market capitalisation.Where will it end? The presidency of the European Commission is ruled out until the Swiss can make up their minds to join. But there is the United Nations, now that Switzerland is a member.Subcomandante Marcos, Mexico’s masked rebel leader, is back. The revolutionary icon and anti-

He turned up to a public gathering wearing his trademark balaclava, military fatigues – and two watches. But he was still two and a half hours late.Tony Blair, British prime minister, was quick on his feet answering questions about whether British diplomats were using a bug inside a fake rock in Moscow.“We never comment on security matters . . . except when we want to, obviously.

765;NKE;Nike Inc;2006-01-23T11:56:39Z;Nike swift to remove trace of former CEO;;"It took Nike barely an hour to purge any mention of Bill Perez from its website.The outgoing chief executive?s biography was swiftly removed from the corporate site as Nike threw its support behind its new chief executive, after Mr Perez resigned amid differences with Nike founder board and chairman Philip Knight,The appointment of 27-year company veteran Mark Parker contrasts with Nike?s decision to look outside the company in November 2004 when Mr Knight stepped down as president and chief executive of the company he founded in 1972.Mr Perez, an avid runner who had participated in 11 marathons, joined Nike from household cleaning products company SC Johnson where he had spent 34 years and been president and chief executive since 1996.Analysts at the time expressed surprise that the company had plumped for an external candidate, noting that outsiders had a mixed record of success at the company whose corporate culture had historically rewarded loyalty.At his first meeting with investors since taking the reins, Mr Perez joked that he had come to Nike, ?from a world where my excitement was based on killing bugs and cleaning windows?, contrasting this with his new life at the global brand dealing with world class athletes.His appointment was seen as an important transition for Nike as it pursued a multi-brand strategy designed to take the Oregon-based company further away from its roots in sports performance shoes.Mr Perez reaffirmed the company?s commitment to developing its non-Nike brands like Converse and Bauer but added that Nike needed, ?a good deal of work on our management depth and our skill set …it?s arguably one of the most important tasks to hand.?His style, with an emphasis on proper use of customer data and management development, was at odds with the charismatic approach taken by his predecessor, who liked to pepper company presentations with slick, inspirational videos of top athletes.In December, barely a month before his resignation, Mr Perez pledged to step up Nike?s drive into emerging markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico and India and to expand its online marketing in an effort to double sales from current levels.After what he described as an ?exhaustive? strategic review, he had concluded that ?for the most part we have the right game plan?.?You won?t see radical change; you?ll see improvements in how we are managing our business,? he said.But Mr Perez?s constant references to management changes appear to have brought him into conflict with Mr Knight. The gamble taken by the founder of the world?s most successful sports wear company to look outside the company for a successor has been brought to an abrupt end.?I?m a strong believer in Just Do It,? Mr Perez said in taking up the chief executive job in November 2004, in reference to Nike?s marketing slogan.Unfortunately for Mr Perez his chairman, in jettisoning the 58-year-old, shared a similar belief."
766;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-12-22T20:56:17Z;Puma determined to make it, one step at a time;;Rarely can a long-term strategic goal have been achieved so prematurely and with so little effort.Only days after Puma announced this summer that it wanted to become the world’s third-largest sporting goods company by 2010, Adidas’s takeover of Reebok of the US automatically brought the German company to its target by knocking one of its rivals out of the game.But amid all the talk of a transaction that will change the shape of the industry, transforming it into a duopoly between Nike of the US and Germany’s Adidas, Jochen Zeitz, Puma’s chief executive, cuts a defiant figure, insisting the takeover will change little for him or for the sector.“Of course, it is a significant thing to be able to say we are the number three,” he says in an interview with the FT. “But we are sticking to our strategy. It is not size that matters – it is whether the customer likes your products.”Speculation on the effect of the Adidas-Reebok deal had focused on whether Puma would be forced to act more quickly and begin its promised attempts to build up other brands aside from the core Puma marque.Puma has already warned that its stellar growth of the last decade, based on the benefits of a brand positioned between the sports and fashion worlds, will slacken in the coming years.But Mr Zeitz, who has been chief executive for more than a decade, resists the charges, saying that Puma needs to grow organically.“It is one step at a time, although those steps are very big,” he adds.He gives short shrift to the idea, put forward by Adidas chief Herbert Hainer in this paper, that the sporting goods industry is now akin to the consumer goods sector, where brands are managed as commodities. “It is not buying toothpaste, it is about selling a lifestyle,” Mr Zeitz says.Puma intends to double in size in the next five years from about €1.8bn ($2.1bn) in sales to €3.5bn, and of that only €300m at most will come from non-Puma brands, Mr Zeitz promises.New segments such as golf and the consolidation of subsidiaries from around the world to give regions outside Europe more weight in the group will contribute to the growth.A significant boost is also due from next year’s football World Cup. Puma will sponsor more of the competition’s teams than any other company – an extraordinary achievement in a sector grown used to the Nike-Adidas duopoly.The company’s focus on Africa is part of the reason for there being 12 Puma-sponsored teams, out of 32 competing.It will sponsor all five countries from the continent in the World Cup and eight of the 16 qualified for next month’s JAN] African Cup of Nations.Given that the World Cup will be held on the continent for the first time in 2010 – in South Africa – it looks a far-sighted decision.“Having 12 teams in itself sends a strong signal to everyone that we want to make the top two into a top three. It makes us feel even more confident about reaching our targets next year,” Mr Zeitz says.Puma expects strong sales of the countries’ jerseys, having chosen many of the teams not just for their sporting prowess but also their association with fashion or style – Italy, for example.More fundamental for Puma are the prospects for its shareholder structure. Rumours persist of a takeover either from Nike – something played down by executives at both companies – or the billionaire Herz siblings, who bought a blocking stake of 25 per cent earlier this year.Rainer Kutzner, head of the Herz investment vehicle and a future supervisory board member of Puma, says he sees no reason to increase the stake at the moment and is pleased with the rise of about a third in the share price since he invested.“The strategy looks good and with the World Cup coming up everyone is going to hear even more about Puma,” he says.

But the gains were so slight, investors were left wondering if the traditional year-end rally had not run out of steam for good.Repeating a pattern seen over the past two weeks, the leading indices closed once again well off their intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent, or 28.18 points, to 10,833.73, after having moved up by as much 80 points.The S&P 500 also gave up substantial gains to end the session up 0.3 per cent, or 3.17 points, at 1,262.79. The Nasdaq Composite recouped part of its 1.3 per cent loss this week, advancing 0.4 per cent, or 9.24 points, to 2,231.66.“This was probably the best chance the bulls had this week to stage a convincing rally,” said Todd Harrison, founder of Minyanville.com, of the late afternoon retreat. “The longer that a [year-end rally] does not occur, the more likely that investors will all turn to sell their positions at the same time.”It was not supposed to end this way. The main indices had risen sharply in morning trading on news of positive corporate earnings and new deal activities.FedEx led the charge, rising 5.3 per cent to $103.70 after it exceeded market expectations with a 33 per cent jump in second-quarter profits. The shipping group also raised its full-year outlook, citing stronger shipping demand from Asia and productivity gains.The news lifted shares of other transport companies and pushed the S&P transportation index up 2.5 per cent. A flurry of merger and acquisition activity also lent the market some support.Seagate Technology announced plans to buy Maxtor, its rival hard disk maker, for $1.9bn in stock – equating to a 60 per cent premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Seagate rose 3.2 per cent to $20.23 while Maxtor surged 53.3 per cent to $6.93.Still in the technology sector, shares in Micromuse rallied 37.6 per cent to $9.92 after IBM said it would acquire the software developer for $865m. IBM inched up 0.8 per cent to $83.12.Elsewhere, Allergan, the maker of skin-smoothing treatment Botox, agreed a $3.42bn offer in cash and stock for Inamed, the breast implant maker. Allergan firmed up 0.7 per cent to $107.31 and Inamed added 1.5 per cent to $87.02.General Motors proved to be the main drag on the Dow, as its shares fell another 4 per cent to hit a new all time low of $19.05. The renewed selling came after Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, cut his stake in the group to 7.8 per cent from 9.9 per cent.Shares in Calpine, the power generator, faded another 13.9 per cent to $0.20 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Nike dropped 3.1 per cent to $85.75 after it reported slower-than-expected growth in its future orders.
768;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-12-21T00:11:11Z;Nike’s Perez targets emerging markets;;"Bill Perez, the chief executive of Nike, said on Tuesday that the sports shoe and clothing company will step up its drive into emerging markets in China, Brazil, Mexico and India and expand its online marketing as it seeks to double its sales from current levels.Mr Perez told Wall Street analysts that an “exhaustive” strategic review of the company after he took over from Phil Knight, its founder, had concluded that “for the most part we have the right game plan”.“You won’t see radical change; you’ll see improvements in how we are managing our business,” he said.These would include a more aggressive approach in emerging markets. “To put it simply we want to own those markets.” Nike, he said, was also in the process of producing a more consistent global strategy for use of the internet and its Nike brand stores, but remained committed to its retail trading partners “where possible”.He also said Nike would seek to improve its position in the lower cost shoe and clothing segment, which currently includes the Starter brand of shoes that it markets through Wal-Mart.Mr Perez made his remarks as Nike reported a 15 per cent increase in second quarter earnings to $301.1m, or $1.14 per share, supported in particular by strong growth in US sports shoe sales.Overall sales increased 10 per cent to $3.5bn. US athletic footwear sales rose 19 per cent to $811.5m, with strong growth in sales of its Jordan brand shoes, which took an estimated 6 per cent of the US footwear maket in the year to November.Nike also reported strong growth in futures orders for athletic shoes and clothing in the US, which it said were up 9 per cent.However, the company’s overseas performance is seeing the impact both of sluggish retail sales in Europe and Japan and of the strengthening of the US dollar against both the euro and the yen. Worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from December to April, totaled $5.2bn, up two and a half per cent. Without currency changes, the company said futures orders would have inceased by 7 per cent.Nike’s shares fell over 4 per cent to $85.59 in after hours trading."
769;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-12-19T18:41:58Z;Brands enter the blogosphere;;"In spite of the high profile of blogs few mainstream UK companies are exploiting the potential of online diaries as an advertising medium.Many marketing directors remain unsure of how to handle blogs. They are wary of the rise of unrestrained bloggers and the negative impact that adverse comments on blogs could have on their brands.However, some notable exceptions suggest that attitudes are changing. Brands such as Dyson, Telewest and Sony have been sponsoring blogs, selecting influential sites in niche areas that fit with their products. They want to be perceived as progressive and in touch with the consumers who are interacting with new digital formats.Earlier this year, Dyson and Telewest ran creative campaigns with TechDigest, a blog focusing on technology news and issues across Europe. Although Tech­Digest is a standalone blog it is part of a commercial network run by Shiny Media, an independent UK-based blogging company.Founded in November 2004, Shiny Media is responsible for 15 blogs on subjects as diverse as celebrity shoes and Coronation Street, the television soap opera. Its directors hope to imitate the success of Gawker Media, the US blogging network that has worked with leading brands such as Nike.Chris Price, a director of Shiny Media, says: “The vast majority of people in the UK don’t know what blogs look like: 95 per cent of blogs are written for one man and his dog and are not commercially orientated. We do carry affiliate and display advertising.” He says potential advertisers are drawn to the blogs network, which attracts more than 1.5m page impressions a month, because they want to be perceived as “hipper and more forward-thinking”.While in many cases it is still an uphill struggle explaining to clients how blogs work, creative agencies are beginning to talk up the medium to potential advertisers. “There are aspects of blogging that make it very compelling. It is empowering consumers,” says Wayne Bickerton, client and partnership director for Diffiniti, an online advertising buyer.Asked if companies should fear the interactive elements of weblogs, he says: “I think they should be worried. It will force an uncomfortable change. The more consumers are empowered the harder it will be for brands to use the traditional push of advertising. However, if they take time to understand blogs and how they can use them to benefit their brands, then I think their fears will be eased.”Media executives at OMD Digital, a unit of Omnicom, the world’s largest marketing services group, have plans for several clients to use blogs next year. With traditional media companies running blogs and the availability of dedicated search engines, such as Blogpulse, advertisers have plenty of options.Already blogs are seen
as places consumers could visit in response to online campaigns where corporate websites might be deemed inflexible or unattractive.“Blogs are a long-term strategy that will work for brands that are able
to open themselves up. It is about long-term engagement and dialogue,” says Oliver Snoddy, media manager
for OMD Digital.“If you just use blogs as a short-term promotional medium you are missing the point.”Agencies forecast that brands will run promotional content within blogs – like traditional magazine advertorials – or organise competitions across commercially friendly blog sites. Mr Snoddy adds that advertisers are considering their own branded blogs with links from their main corporate websites.Even at this early stage in the emergence of blogs as an advertising and sponsorship medium it is clear that blog content has to be genuinely engaging for its target audience. Simply publishing ­public relations messages does not attract readers. As more mainstream brands engage with blogs they will have to discard some of their traditional communications disciplines.The writer is a director of ItsBlogs, a blogs consultancy"
770;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-12-15T20:21:18Z;Notebook;;Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been placed on “probation” by senior members of his party, who have warned that he could face a leadership challenge next year unless he does a better job.London – Senior Liberal Democrats have initiated behind-the-scenes talks to recruit Robbie Williams, the well-known pop singer, as their next party leader.The “draft Robbie” movement is the most tangible sign yet of the growing dissatisfaction with the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Charles Kennedy.Senior Liberal Democrats believe Mr Kennedy lacks the sex appeal needed to cope with the challenge posed by David Cameron, the photogenic new leader of the Conservative party.“If you saw Robbie on Parky, you would know that he would make mincemeat out of anyone Labour or the Tories put up against him in the Commons,” a senior party official said. “We believe we are one cheeky chappie away from political power.”The official acknowledged that Mr Williams has no known political views but maintained that formulating policy is no longer the most important job of a modern political leader.“Our marketing advisers tell us that the key to success for any brand is developing a visual identity,” the senior party official said. “Robbie would be the Lib-Dem equivalent of the Nike swoosh or those bubbles in the advertisements for the O2 mobile telephone network.”Liberal Democrats were also understood to have been impressed by Mr Williams’ recent success in using the courts to refine his public image. This month Mr Williams accepted undisclosed libel damages from publishers who had printed stories alleging he was a secret homosexual. His lawyer read a statement in court saying, “Mr Williams is not and never has been homosexual.”“Like the Liberal Democrats, Robbie has faced the criticism that he is neither fish nor fowl, as it were,” the official said. “He made it clear where he stood, or lay, or what have you, and we believe that he could work the same magic for us.”Branding consultants said that if the Liberal Democrats are successful, their opposite numbers in Labour and the Conservatives will probably respond by trying to recruit pop stars of their own.Indeed, there were already signs that the Conservatives have made a move in that direction. As part of Mr Cameron’s campaign to recruit more women for his party, Tory officials have put out feelers to former members of the Spice Girls, according to London identity consultants.“David really fancies Posh for the Tory back bench,” said a consultant.Giving unto othersWith profits at record heights, several of the world’s leading investment banks are revealing their annual bonuses.London – The spirits of the poor, the sick and the hungry were lifted in the UK and around the world yesterday as some of the world’s most powerful investment banks handed out their annual bonuses.City bonuses are reaching the highest levels in years and industry analysts know what that means – efforts by investment bankers to give something back and make this world a better place.“Trading volumes are sinking like Luca Brasi in the East River,” said an official at a US investment bank who spends too much of his leisure time watching DVDs.“All the guys are either on the phones with their favourite charities or heading out the door with bags of presents to hand out to terminally ill children or orphans. Nobody’s doing any business.”Analysts said the displays of generosity could rival those seen during the height of the internet bubble when so many good things were happening in so many places that some proclaimed an end to history and the start of an economy marked by technological progress, low inflation and social justice.Private partyThe City of London has been swept by speculation that a consortium of really, really big private equity groups is being formed to buy the entire UK.It was unclear what sparked the rumours but analysts suggested it might have had something to do with the news that Terra Firma, the European private equity firm, had hired Lord Birt, the prime minister’s strategy adviser. Lord Birt, who had served as an adviser to McKinsey and as director-general of the BBC, will be giving up his government post to focus on business opportunities.“People are putting two and two together and thinking someone out there is looking to make a run at the UK,” said a senior banking source.“There’s been about $230bn in private equity deals worldwide this year and there is still a lot of money that has been raised and has to be put to work.”
771;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-10-14T18:18:02Z;What the experts say: Dress2Kill;;The good news for Dress2Kill is that the fashion media believe the time is right for a revival of the tailored suit as men become more aware of what they wear, writes Jonathan Moules.Bill Prince, deputy editor of men’s magazine GQ, says: “Men are thinking far more seriously about what they are wearing and once they have had one suit made for them, there is no going back.”Dress2Kill is very interesting, according to Mr Prince, because it is attempting to demystify the process of buying a made-to-measure suit, which is often the biggest barrier to a man purchasing such a garment.“There is still a huge resistance to going to Saville Row, which is thought to be quite an intimidating process,” Mr Prince adds. “With Dress2Kill it is very much done on your terms rather than that of the tailor.”Richard Hyman, managing director of Verdict Research, the retailing consultancy, is concerned about Dress2Kill’s move into a physical presence. He claims that few clothing designers have succeeded in selling their garments through retail outlets.“You cannot be a retailer and a manufacturer. You are either one or another.”He points to the struggles that Nike has faced making its Niketown shops profitable. Disney’s stores have always been lossmaking, he adds.“You make a profit selling suits to people by adding value in the fabric quality, the colours and the styling. The value added in retail, in contrast, is very intangible.”Given the Dress2Kill’s solid financial performance, however, Chris Lane, a partner at accountants Kingston Smith, is surprised that the company was not able to get its bank loan.He recommends James Hibbert employ a credit agency to check his credit history to make sure Dress2Kill has not been given any black marks in error, perhaps because it has been confused with another company.Another possibility could be that the lender was making an excuse because it did not want to provide what it saw as risk capital.An alternative strategy might have been to try the Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme, in which the government agrees to back loans for companies without many physical assets. However, Mr Lane notes that the final decision still rests with the lending institution.“At the end of the day if you cannot convince the bank to give you the money, you will need to turn to external business angels or what I call friends, family and fools.”
772;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-09-19T20:21:56Z;Wall Street lower despite energy gains;;Oil shares on Wall Street were boosted on Monday by another rise in crude prices and news that Norway’s Norsk Hydro plans to takeover Spinnaker Exploration for $2.5bn in cash.Shares in the Houston-based Spinnaker Exploration shares swelled 31.5 per cent to $64.12 by the close on Monday.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach & Co, described the premium as “hefty” and said more deals could follow, with the sector ripe for consolidation.The jump was part of a broader advance for energy stocks that saw Amerada Hess put on 4.3 per cent to $139.31 after JP Morgan’s Jennifer Rowland upgraded the stock and raised the sector’s earnings target.Marathon Oil rose 1.8 per cent to $69.19, while ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $70.24. ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world, was up 1.4 per cent to $64.63 and became the fourth company in the S&P 500 index to reach a market capitalisation of more than $400bn. The energy sector now makes up 10 per cent of the S&P 500, for the first time since 1994.Energy stocks were fired up by a rally in crude futures amid concerns about another hurricane hitting the production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. In late trading, prices for West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose more than $4 to $67.39 a barrel as Tropical Storm Rita gathered strength and headed for the Gulf.Airline stocks fell amid concerns about the effects of high fuel prices on an industry plagued by cost pressures. The Amex airline index lost 3.4 per cent as AirTran, the low-cost carrier, gave up 5.7 per cent to $10.43. Continental Airlines was 6.3 per cent off at $10.98.Among other stocks in the news, Nike rose 6.4 per cent to $83.45 after its third-quarter profits beat expectations. Strong sales led to a 32 per cent jump in profits in the quarter for the athletic equipment maker.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 10,555.80, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent lower at 1,231.13. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,145.21.However, Art Hogan, chief US analyst at Jefferies, also attributed some of the fall to Friday’s 0.8 per cent rise in the Dow off the back of the expiration of September futures and options contracts. He argued that at least half such moves are typically retraced in the following session.Investors also were awaiting the outcome of a keenly watched meeting on Tuesday of the monetary policy body of the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent.Mr Cardillo believed most market participants were still expecting a quarter-point hike, and argued that the market had now priced in the likelihood of the Fed holding rates at 3.5 per cent.
773;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;US demand boosts Nike earnings;;Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe maker, said on Monday it was confident it could meet its earnings targets for the year after strong first quarter results, while acknowleging growing pressures on global consumer confidence.“The macro-economic trends are clearly creating more uncertainty for consumers today than they were just three short months ago,” said Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand, citing the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the London bombings, and high fuel prices.But Mr Denson said Nike was confident of its position in an increasingly challenging retail environment in the US, which accounts for around 40 per cent of its sales, citing the continuing strength of its brand identity.“We continue to perform very strong at retail…and we’re pretty bullish on the future as well,” he said.Nike’s earnings for the first quarter increased 32 per cent to $432.3m, or $1.61 per diluted share, almost 30 cents above Wall Street’s expectations. Global revenues increased eight per cent to $3.9bn.Future orders for Nike footwear were also up 11 per cent for the five coming months against the same period last year, at $4.9bn.Donald Blair, chief financial officer, described the US region, and in particular US footwear sales, as “the principle driver of more rapid growth”.US footwear sales were up 12 per cent during the quarter. Clothing sales in the US rose 1 per cent, despite the ending of the company’s licensing agreement with the National Basketball Association, due to an 11 per cent increase in sales of Nike and Jordan branded clothing.However, the company also reported increased pressure on its profit margins from higher commodity prices due to high oil prices. “There’s a level of uncertainty there, but our goal is to pull the levers we do control and make sure that our profitability and our business keeps advancing,” said Mr Blair.In a confererence call with Wall Street analysts neither Mr Blair nor Mr Denson referred to the possible impact on the company’s US business of the planned merger of Adidas and Reebok, announced last month.Elsewhere, the company highlighted the growing importance of sales in Latin America, and said it was planning its biggest World Cup marketing effort ever at the summer 2006 soccer championships in Germany.Nike’s shares were up 7 per cent to $83.95 at lunchtime in New York.
774;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-08-18T18:31:48Z;Culture clashes form hybrids;;Globalisation will lead to homogenisatioThere is a commonly held belief that globalisation is homogenising cultures and markets, or as some have put it: “Globalisation is making everywhere look like everywhere else.” Dozens of books and thousands of column inches have been devoted to discussing whether this is a good or bad thing. But there is a rather more fundamental question: is it actually happening?The question is important for businesses and managers, because on it depends a whole range of strategic decisions. Should we be preparing for One Big Market, in which the same brands are sold to the same consumers using the same advertising campaigns the world over? Or should we be preparing for a world of diversity, in which resurgent local cultures will demand that global businesses cater for specific local needs?The problem is that it is very difficult to determine what is happening out there in the wide world.On the one hand, there are plenty of signs that globalisation is creating homogenous markets. Walk down the main shopping streets of Beijing, Mumbai, London or New York, and you will see the same brand names, the same advertisements, the same chain stores. Some brands have global appeal: Coca-Cola, Nike, BMW and Courvoisier seem to push the same buttons with consumers everywhere. English is rapidly becoming a global lingua franca and western business methods have been successfully exported to every developed economy on the planet.But, there are quite as many signs pointing the other way. Once it was feared that Hollywood cinema would crush local film-making. Instead, film-making centres such as Hong Kong and Mumbai have flourished. Indian “Bollywood” cinema, once regarded as a laughing stock outside India, is becoming a powerful economic force. And new regional film-making centres are springing up in Iran and also Nigeria., where “Nollywood” is touted as the next big thing.In other cases, the global and the local combine to form a hybrid. Basketball has flourished in Lithuania, thanks in part to the fact that Lithuanians are taller than other Europeans. On the surface, this looks like another example of American sport dominating the world. But the top Lithuanian basketball team, and European champions, Zalgiris Kaunas, are named not after an American icon, but after a battle in 1410 at which Lithuanians defeated German crusaders. Local iconography has been tacked onto a global product and Lithuanians have made basketball their own.That brings us back to the problem of what sort of new world businesses should be preparing for. The answer is yet another paradox: we should be preparing for a world in which both convergence and local resurgence are powerful forces. Sometimes these will act to cancel each other out, or one will dominate at the expense of the other. Coca-Cola’s gradual elimination of many local soft drink brands in India is an example of global culture triumphing over the local. The rapid growth in Chinese cities of noodle bars at the expense of western fast-food chains is an example of local culture holding its own against the global.More often than not, the two cultures, global and local, will combine to create something new. It will then be up to businesses to respond to whatever this new culture and new market require, using their worldwide resources to come up with satisfactory products. Today, companies talk about the need to “think global, act local”. The next generation’s watchword may well be, “think local, act global”.

776;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-08-03T20:36:26Z;Data and oil rein in Wall Street;;Wall Street staged a modest retreat for most of the session before closing mixed on Wednesday as crude prices again hit record highs before easing back and some US data came in slightly weaker than expected.The lacklustre performance by equities was in spite of continued merger activity and a surge for Reebok shares after Germany’s Adidas agreed to buy the iconic sports company for $3.8bn.The newly formed group would create the world’s second biggest sporting goods company, just behind Nike.Reebok’s shares soared 30 per cent to $57.14.Nike moved higher, 1.3 per cent to $86.92, on the back of the news.At the close, the Nasdaq was down 0.1 per cent at 2,216.81. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1 per cent at 1,245.03 and 10,697.59, respectively.Stocks were muted by an early surge in oil prices, although the gains evaporated following a surprising rise in US domestic crude inventories.Investors were disappointed by the Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index, which came in slightly below expectations at 60.5 in July versus the expected 61.But analysts said the market’s slight fall could have been due more to investors consolidating after gains earlier in the week.“I wouldn’t call today a sell-off, just more of a pause,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co.“When the market does well, you look for reasons to take a break.”In other corporate news, media conglomerate Time Warner said its quarterly earnings fell when it posted a $321m loss after reaching a $2.5bn settlement on securities fraud litigation with its shareholders.Shares slipped 0.9 per cent to $17.27.Strong earnings reports from the energy sector continued, with Devon Energy saying profits rose 30 per cent in the second quarter. But stock slipped 0.3 per cent to $57.60.The airline sector lost heavily yesterday, with Delta Airlines dropping to their lowest level for at least 43 years as fears mounted that the struggling carrier was edging closer to bankruptcy.Delta fell 8.3 per cent to $2.32 at the close after hitting a record low on Tuesday as well.Skywest slipped 1.3 per cent to $20.82.Northwest Airlines struggled as the union representing some of its workers walked out of contract negotiations.The stock dropped almost 8.6 per cent to $4.37.The three companies’ losses contributed to a 1.5 per cent drop to the Amex airline index which was at 50.83 at the close.Drugstore chain CVS saw its shares fall 1.5 per cent to $30.77 despite the higher-than-expected 18 per cent increase in quarterly profit, driven by higher demand for prescription drugs and general merchandise.Meanwhile, Toyota Motor said earnings dropped 7 per cent in the second quarter but raised forecasts for vehicle sales for the whole year. The report comes after the three largest US auto manufacturers said July car sales soared.Toyota’s New York-listed shares lost 1.0 per cent to $76.17.“While the [US] big three grabbed the headlines [on Tuesday] by offering some of the biggest deals ever, the foreign brands also enjoyed record sales, albeit with much less fanfare,” said John Casesa, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
777;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-08-03T19:35:46Z;Lex: Adidas;;We do not need to be shoemakers to know if our shoes fit, claimed Hegel. Similarly, one does not need to be a German idealist to find something to like in Adidas's latest purchase.Admittedly, Reebok hardly comes cheap, at a 40 per cent premium over the stock's three-month average.Pre-tax cost savings of €125m from 2008 onwards only cover about three-quarters of that, even assuming Adidas holds on to most of the savings. That is hardly a given, as it appears keen to step up the pressure on Nike.But at least by sector standards, achieving Adidas's goals would make Reebok almost bargain-basket material. Cost savings alone shrink the price tag from 18.5 to just over 14 times this year's earnings of Reebok. Adidas tentatively hints the benefits could be even larger on the revenue side. The two businesses complement each other fairly well, which should secure more shelf-space for the innovations their combined expertise might yield.The main snag is that with almost €9bn in sales, the new Adidas will need to do more than simply boost its market share to outgrow the world economy for long. Shoe-rack space constraints also put a limit on how many pairs any jogger can store. Given that, Adidas's rating at 18.5 times 2005 earnings looks hefty, even if integration and antitrust risks prove manageable. Much like sportspeople, shoemakers have an almost dialectic tendency to stumble whenever things have gone well for a while as Adidas's own history demonstrates.
778;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-08-03T16:22:21Z;Adidas sets the pace but bourses stumble;;European shares edged lower on Wednesday as investors digested a host of corporate earnings, but a bold takeover move by Germany’s Adidas sent its shares soaring.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 retreated from Tuesday’s three-year high to close down 0.2 per cent at 1,187.1.German sports goods maker Adidas Salomon saw its shares gain 7.4 per cent to €158.45 after the company announced plans to buy US rival Reebok in a €3.1bn deal that would expand its reach into arch rival Nike’s home market.Shares initially moved sharply lower on concerns that Adidas, the second biggest sports good manufacturer after Nike, had overpaid for the deal, which it expects to close in early 2006.“Although in terms of brand positioning and country exposure the deal could make sense, our initial comment would be that we are sceptical because of the sheer size and risk involved,” said Cora Helmholz at Deutsche Bank.However, after initial scepticism, the shares rallied as chief financial officer Robin Stalker sought to reassure market worries, saying he saw the synergies of the deal “very quickly outweighing the costs.”Another packed day on the corporate reporting calendar included companies worth 14 per cent by market capitalisation of Germany’s Xetra Dax index announcing quarterly earnings figures.German chemicals giant BASF posted a 31 per-cent rise in second-quarter earnings, beating analysts’ forecasts as strengthening revenues from oil and plastics added to a strong showing in North America.WestLB upgraded the stock to “buy” from “outperform”, and raised its price target to €70 from €62. However, having risen more than 7 per cent over the past three weeks, investors took the opportunity to book some profits and the shares fell 0.9 per cent to €59.41.By contrast, Germany’s BMW, the world’s largest luxury carmaker, reported a 15.5 per cent fall in second-quarter pre-tax profits, much worse than feared. The company cited unfavourable exchange rates, high raw material prices and increasingly intense competition. Shares slipped 4.3 per cent to €37.92.Commerzbank, Germany’s third biggest bank, rose 5.6 per cent to €19.27 despite announcing a 27 per cent fall in second-quarter net profit. The drop was expected, however, due to the closure of some of the bank’s trading operations and management confirmed the return on equity target of 8 per cent for the year.Britta Schmidt, strategist at Fox-Pitt Kelton, said: “We reiterate our ‘outperform’ recommendation based on an improving German macroeconomic picture, undemanding valuation and scarcity value following the Unicredito/HVB deal.”Credit Suisse fell 1.6 per cent to SFr53.35 after revealing that net profit fell to SFr919m in the second quarter from SFr1.457bn in the same period last year, as the bank set aside almost SFr1bn to cover legal risks connected to Enron. The bank is one of several that could face claims following its role in the fraud at the US energy company that collapsed in 2001.BNP Paribas beat forecasts, reporting a 4.7 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits as France’s second-largest bank recorded higher sales and lower-than-expected risk provisions. However, after an initial rally, shares gave back their gains to close 0.7 per cent lower at €60. French peer Credit Agricole rose 1.3 per cent to €22.95.Henkel, the German consumer goods group, rose 0.7 per cent to €77.40 after the maker of Persil detergents and Pritt glues announced a 14 per-cent rise in second quarter operating profit. Anaylsts at Deutsche Bank reiterated their “buy” recommendation on the stock.TeliaSonera, the Nordic telecoms group, tumbled 5.1 per cent to SKr37.30 after announcing below-forecast second-quarter earnings. The company said price pressures were weighing heavily and forcing cost-cutting measures including the loss of an estimated 3,000 jobs in Sweden.“While currency trends, cost-cutting measures and the effects of consolidation will increasingly help Telia in coming quarters, Swedish fixed competition is intensifying and the stock is not cheap,” noted Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.German drugs and chemicals group Altana rose 4.5 per cent to €45.69 after it said it had agreed to pay €630m for speciality chemicals group Eckart and announced plans to establish Altana Chemie as a separately listed company in 2006 following the integration of the acquisition.
779;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-07-27T09:59:56Z;Puma profits leap ahead on strong US growth;;Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer, on Wednesday outlined an aggressive plan for growth, in a bid to double its size in the next five years and capture €3.5bn ($4.2bn) of sales.The iconic sportswear retailer, famed for its cat logo, said it would move into five new areas, including golf and motorcycling, and hoped to get €200m additional sales from these categories.It is planning to squeeze €500m out of existing categories such as running and football and €800m from geographical and licence expansion. The group is also hoping to drive an additional €300m from new acquisitions, which it said would be in areas where Puma does not have a presence.Puma, which has been one of corporate Germany’s success stories in recent years, after restructuring and repositioning itself as an edgy and more fashionable rival to bigger groups such as Adidas and Nike, is under pressure to maintain its strong sales performance.Details of the growth strategy came as sales and earnings sprinted ahead of expectations for the second quarter, boosted by buoyant growth in the US and strong performances in footwear and accessories.In the US, sales were up 55.1 per cent up on a currency-neutral basis €108m in the second quarter. The region now accounts for 23 per cent of sales.In the second quarter, consolidated group sales rose 12.3 per cent to €395.5m, while earnings before interest and tax rose nearly 11 per cent to €82m.Second-quarter sales growth was “slight” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region which represents 67 per cent of total consolidated sales, at €240m . Asia-Pacific sales were ahead 16.2 per cent in currency neutral terms to €47m for the same period.Footwear sales rose by 16.7 per cent, clothing by 1.7 per cent and accessories by 23 per cent in currency neutral terms.The retailer also raised guidance saying that annual sales were now expected to grow by 10 per cent, surpassing previous predictions of mid to high-single-digit growth and added that it would return up to €500m back to shareholders, through share repurchasing and raised dividends.In May, the billionaire Herz family paid about €500m for a 17 per cent stake in Puma as part of plans to invest €4bn in the European consumer goods sector in the following months.Shares rose by 0.4 per cent in early trade to €226.
780;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-29T20:53:26Z;New Nike chief on the starting blocks;;Bill Perez, who took over as chief executive of Nike six months ago, is aware that after 34 years at SC Johnson, the household products company, he's now in a different business culture at the world's largest sports shoe and clothing company.“I come from a world where my excitement was based on killing bugs and cleaning windows,” he told analysts and investors in New York on Tuesday, contrasting his new life at Nike dealing with world-class athletes.The 57-year old MrPerez took over from Nike's co-founder, Phil Knight,in December. His appointment was seen as an important transition for Nike as it pursues a multi-brand strategy that is taking the Oregon-based company further away from its roots in sports performance shoes.The new CEO has kept a low profile since his appointment. Tuesday's meeting was his first public appearance before Wall Street analysts, a new experience for an executive who built his career within a privately-held company.Mr Perez's presentation was largely devoid of the inspirational, rhetorical style of the Nike sports videos of top athletes that used to pepper the company's presentations.Nike's top executives also did most of the talking on the details of what Mr Perez called “the extraordinary growth that lies ahead”, after he highlighted opportunities in women's fitness, in US basketball, in soccer and in China.Mr Perez also reaffirmed Nike's commitment to developing its non-Nike brands, including the lower-cost Converse brand, and Starter, which started this year selling sports shoes in Wal-Mart, the discount retailer.“While the Nike brand is the life blood of this company, we will see an increasing percentage [of growth] coming from other brands,” he said.But while he saw no need to change the business strategy, he hinted at some of the strengths he hopes to bring to Nike from SC Johnson, producer of Drano drain-cleaner and Ziploc plastic bags.After adding about $4bn in sales in five years Mr Perez said Nike now needed “a good deal of work on our management depth and our skill set …it's arguably one of the most important tasks to hand”.Nike, he said, also needed to make more efforts to exploit the kind of customer data that are common in the consumer products industry, and that some of its trading partners had made such information exchange available “only recently”.“The availability of data in the CPG (consumer packaged goods) world is incredible …and sometimes here we struggle to have access to that data,” he said, adding that Nike needed to start dealing with its retailers on a “quantitative” rather than a “relationship” basis.Mr Perez’ emphasis on issues such as data utilisation and management development marked a contrast with the charismatic and sometimes enigmatic personality of his predecessor. And he underlined his down-to-earth pragmatism by casually remarking that his old base of Racine, Wisconsin might even have some advantages over Nike’s home outside Portland, Oregon - an area that has come to represent the spiritual heartland of American running.“We try staying attuned to the market, which is a challenge sometimes when you are in Portland, as opposed to being very close to Chicago,” he told the meeting, with something close to a nervous laugh.
781;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-29T12:59:45Z;New Nike CEO makes public debut;;Bill Perez, who took over as chief executive of Nike six months ago, on Tuesday reaffirmed the company’s strategy of developing its non-Nike brands, including the low cost Starter range.“While the Nike brand is the life blood of this company, we will see an increasing percentage [of revenue] coming from other brands,” he told analysts and investors in New York.The meeting was Mr Perez’s first with investors since taking over from Nike’s co-founder Phil Knight in December. Mr Perez, who previously spent 34 years with SC Johnson, the privately-held household products company, joked that he had come to Nike “from a world where my excitement was based on killing bugs and cleaning windows”.While saying that he didn’t want to change the business strategy at Nike, Mr Perez highlighted opportunities in lower cost footwear and clothing through the company’s Converse and Starter brands, which sell at lower cost and discount outlets.This year, Nike started selling Starter sports performance shoes for $26-38 in Wal-Mart stores in the US, and Mr Perez said he saw opportunities for taking the concept overseas.Nike’s other brands, which also include Cole Haan, Hurley and Bauer, accounted for 8.9 per cent of the company’s $13.7bn revenue in its recently concluded financial year.Scott Olivet, who heads the company’s non-Nike other brands division, said Nike was also planning to expand its Starter line at Wal-Mart into clothing, with a marketing campaign focused on basketball planned for early next year.In March Nike signed Brett Favre, the American football quarterback, to endorse the brand.He also said he saw growing demand for fashion merchandise from discount store “value” customers. “The value customer is evolving, they don’t want to settle for last year’s colours and styles,” he said.Mr Perez, in response to questions on the future direction of the company under his leadership, said he believed Nike needed to make more efforts to exploit the kind of customer data that are common in the consumer products industry, and that some of its trading partners had made such information available “only recently”He also stressed the need to deepen Nike’s pool of management potential by giving opportunities to younger managers, and to invest more in marketing talent that had been stretched by its rapid global expansion.
782;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-27T20:25:48Z;Wall Street kept in check by high oil price;;Nike was one of the main casualties of a subdued Monday on Wall Street as traders pondered the ramifications of yet another jump in oil prices.In a day of mixed corporate news, the announcement by Nike of better-than-expected fourth quarter profits was not enough to prevent its share price sliding 4 per cent to $85.77 after the sports shoe maker also issued a cautious revenue forecast.The overall market remained largely flat however as oil prices, helped by news of the election of an ultraconservative new president of Iran, moved back past the $60 a barrel mark.Benchmark Nymex crude futures for August delivery rose 81 cents to $60.65, topping last Thursday’s high that sent the markets into reverse after earlier gains.The S&P 500 was fractionally down at 1,190.69 and the Dow Jones industrial average also ended the day down at 10,290.78.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,045.20.“Everything is dominated by oil and people are focusing on it as if nothing good can happen,” said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher.“My guess is that we will soon find something else to obsess about, but for the time being it is still a very trading dominated short-term market with the majority of trades being generated by programmes.”Yesterday was also a small milestone for Google, the phenomenally successful search engine, which pushed through the $300 range, finishing up 2.3 per cent at $304.10.The stock has now more than tripled its $85 float less than a year ago. Not everyone was impressed, however.“It’s all about speculation becuase these guys don’t seem to care about valuation at all,” said Fred Hickey, editor of High-Tech Strategist. “They only care about the stock price and there were some worries that it would be stopped rising by the magical $300 level. Now $400 is the next stop.”It was also a good day for Bausch & Lomb, which earned an upgrade from Piper Jaffray & Co after the maker of Ray-Bans and other eye products announced it was speeding up production of its Pure Vision Toric contact lenses to meet demand. Its shares were the best performers in the S&P 500 and were up 5.4 per cent at $80.39.In other results news, Walgreen, the US drugstore chain, put in a good performance with sales in the third quarter up 13 per cent to $10.8bn. It gained 3.3 per cent, taking its shares to $45.85.Apple shares were down 1.8 per cent at $37.10 after Barron’s, the business magazine, warned that the company behind the best-selling iPod music players could lose out from a new generation of mobile phone handsets capable of storing and playing tunes.Pfizer also took a knock after the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of Bextra, the Cox-2 inhibitor. Its shares fell 1.5 per cent to $28.08.
783;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-27T12:54:05Z;Nike quarterly profit rises 15 per cent;;Nike, the shoe and apparel company, announced a 15 per cent increase in quarterly earnings on Monday to $349.5bn, but saw its shares fall over four per cent after a cautious sales forecast.Don Blair, Nike’s chief financial officer, said Nike still expected high-single-digit sales growth for the coming fiscal year. But he said revenue growth in the current quarter would be toward the lower end of the 7 to 9 per cent forecast range.Sales of Nike-brand athletic shoes in the US rose seven per cent to $907.2m during the quarter, supported by strong demand of Nike’s more expensive Shox and Air Jordan shoes. But sales of apparel in the US fell seven per cent to $335.9m, due in part to the expiration of Nike’s rights to produce clothing licensed by the National Basketball Association. US sales increased three per cent to $1.3 billion.Worldwide sales in the quarter ending on May 31 increased seven per cent to $3.7bn, of which three percentage points were due to currency gains due to the weak dollar.In a statement, William Perez, the chief executive who took over from Nike’s co-founder Phil Knight in December, also highlighted the performance of its Converse and Cole Haan brands.The company said current worldwide futures orders for the company’s Nike brand athletic footwear and apparel totaled $6.3bn, 9.5 per cent above last year’s levels. The futures orders cover product scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005.“We’re very pleased with the brand strength reflected in these futures results and we see continued potential for profitable expansion across our portfolio of businesses,” Mr Perez said.Mr Perez, who previously headed SC Johnson, the consumer products company, is due to hold his first meeting with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday in New York, at which he is expected to set out his strategy for Nike’s future of the company.Nike’s shares were trading at $85.50 at midday in New York.
784;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-26T17:03:59Z;Adidas sees record profits in World Cup year;;Adidas, the German sports clothing company, hopes to emerge triumphant from next year’s football world cup, the company’s CEO told the Financial Times Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper.“We hope to make more than €1bn next year,” Herbert Hainer, said in an interview. As part of its tactics to make record profits, the group intends to invest up to €900m in the world cup.The world cup should offer sports clothing companies the chance to enjoy an improvement in growth – and is an event that Puma, Adidas’ competitor, also hopes to exploit.Adidas increased its turnover in holding countries like Japan and Korea by 30 per cent during the 2002 football world cup and turnover has increased there year on year by double figures.Four years ago, Adidas broke into the French market and it remains the company’s biggest market in Europe.By 2006, the group, which is the second biggest sports clothing brand in the world after Nike, hopes to increase its current 47 per cent share of the German market to 50 per cent.“At this level, everyone has to fight hard for every single percentage point,” Guenter Weigl, head of Adidas’ football division, said.Worldwide, there is a turnover potential of €3bn in football clothing and accessories at the 2006 world cup – around 400m Euro more than this year. Adidas hopes to see a third of this.Adidas has 100 employees to work exclusively on preparations for the tournament, which begins on June 9. “It is a unique opportunity, at least, as long as I am the CEO,” Mr Hainer said. “It is the chance of the century. Football is everything to us,” he added. Football makes up one sixth of the company’s turnover, which in 2004 amounted to 900m Euro.Mr Hainer must also secure the company’s position within Europe – the brand is now no longer the first choice in the world of football. Last year, Nike, the US rival, was for the first time, the leading football brand in Europe – ahead of Adidas. But, Adidas has managed to strengthen its share of the European market by increasing it to 35 per cent from 30 per cent.
785;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-19T20:57:42Z;Vietnamese PM begins US tour;;"Vietnam's prime minister, Phan Van Khai, with over 200 officials and businessmen in tow, today begins a groundbreaking visit to the US, intended to bury any lingering bitterness between the former enemies, and enhance business, education and intelligence links.Mr Khai, a 71-year-old Soviet-trained economic moderniser, will be the first Vietnamese prime minister to visit Washington since the 1975 collapse of US-backed South Vietnam, and the first ever from Hanoi's Communist regime.His milestone journey includes visits to the White House to meet President George W. Bush; Seattle to chat with Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, and executives from Nike and Boeing; New York to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange; and Boston to tour Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.With its diverse itinerary, the trip is seen as a symbolic affirmation that bilateral relations will be based on pragmatism and common interests, rather than historical grudges.“My presence in the United States reflects that we have put the past behind us,” Mr Khai said in Hanoi on the eve of his departure. Mr Khai's top priority is to secure Mr Bush's support for Hanoi's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, crucial for maintaining Vietnam's economic reform. Hanoi also hopes to promote US investment, which currently amounts to about $3.3bn (€2.7bn, £1.8bn). “They want to market Vietnam to the US raise its profile, and find some investors to get involved in this great GDP growth story,” said Fred Burke, managing partner at Baker McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's business capital.Vietnam has already come a long way since the two countries normalised relations in July 1995. Then the Communist regime, with its state-controlled economy, was emerging from a period when it struggled to meet the basic subsistence needs of its burgeoning population.Today, Vietnam is one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, growing at about 7 per cent a year since 2000. US-Vietnam trade was $6.4bn last year, up from $1.5bn in 2001. Of the trade flows, nearly $5bn was accounted for by Vietnamese exports to the US last year.Affluence is also rising. According to statistics collected by the International Monetary Fund, less than 30 per cent of Vietnam's estimated 82m people live in poverty today, down from about 60 per cent in 1993, and just 10 per cent are below the food poverty line.Although loath to admit it publicly, Hanoi is believed to see the US as a potential counter-balance to its powerful neighbour China."
786;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-06-17T02:07:59Z;Chinese shoe manufacturers prepare for more EU filings;;Chinese shoe manufacturers say they expect anti-dumping actions filed by the European Union to be the first in a series and doubted the mechanism used to settle the recent bilateral textile dispute could be used for their sector.A spokeswoman for the China Leather Association said on Thursday that local industry had been expecting the anti-dumping action since February and expected a number of further filings by September.“We predict that the EU will not just launch an investigation into the two categories it will spread to other shoes,” she said.The anti-dumping action was filed following an EU finding that Chinese shoe imports in some categories had increased by nearly 700 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of 2005.The spokeswoman for the leather association in Beijing disputed those figures, saying that the increase in value for the first three months of this year was about 30 per cent.The shoe dispute, although a relatively small part of overall trade, has coincided with rising anxiety in Europe about the threat to industry and jobs from cheap Chinese imports.Shoe exports, unlike textiles, are not expected to generate concerns in Washington, however, as the US ended restrictions on Chinese shoe exports two decades ago, leading to the quasi-extinction of its domestic shoe manufacturing sector and encouraging companies such as Nike to expand production in China. Quotas on Chinese shoes in Europe were only abolished at the start of this year.Liu Jianchao, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, struck a more optimistic note about the shoe dispute at a regular briefing yesterday, saying the government hoped “we can reach an understanding or an agreement just like we did on the textile issue”.However, the possibility of a rapid rise in textile imports was covered in a specific agreement as part of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, whereas shoes is not.“This will not be like textiles,” said the leather association spokeswoman.China is experiencing pressure from both the EU and the US over its rapidly growing exports and swelling trade surplus, which is expected to triple this year, from $32bn (€26.5bn, £17.5bn) to more than $100bn.The government and think-tanks in Beijing have been studying options to restrain exports, but apart from the deal struck on textiles, which lays down limits in increases in Chinese sales to the EU until 2008, few proposals have been put forward.If the US experience is anything to go by, EU manufacturers have much to fear from imports taking an increasing share of the market.Figures collected by the American Apparel & Footwear Association show that annual US shoe consumption rose by 150 per cent from 1964 to 2003, while the imported share of the market increased from 21 to 98 per cent.
787;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-05-02T17:37:10Z;Adidas earns its fashion stripes;;"For decades sportswear companies such as Adidas and Nike have prospered by linking their brands to athletes and sports stars such as Michael Jordan and David Beckham.But in what is a fairly radical move for an industry averse to moving from tried and tested formulae, Adidas has enlisted a star from the fashion world to help it sell more sports clothing and footwear. Last week, the German group unveiled a new collection from its collaboration with Stella McCartney, the fashion designer it has enlisted to produce a range of women's sportswear that could change the way sports goods are sold and marketed.The new range is the latest example of how Adidas has tried to differentiate itself from its rivals by organising itself into three divisions - each with its own branding and its own version of the group's iconic three-stripe logo. The divisions comprise a performance sport business, a sports fashion division and a retro division, to capitalise on continued interest in so-called ""old school"" Adidas trainers and clothing, as worn by hip-hop artists.The strategy appears to be paying off, with the group yesterday reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results. Operating profits were up by 27 per cent to €179m ($230m) and the group said it expected full-year earnings growth to be at the upper end of its previous 10-15 per cent range.Unlike its previous campaigns, the company is not using famous sports stars to publicise the McCartney collection, relying instead on the strength of the McCartney brand to attract fashion-conscious women who also like to keep fit.Adidas has worked with fashion creators before - notably Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese designer, on its Y3 range, which was aimed at modish consumers rather than active sportsmen and women. The McCartney range is, however, designed with sport in mind and belongs to the group's ""sports performance"" division. Taking fabrics normally used in Adidas' sportswear, Ms McCartney has created a fashion line targeted at women who want to look good while they are exercising.""Stella felt women's sportswear was not stylish enough,"" says Bill Sweeney, head of global apparel at Adidas' sports performance division. ""Women are becoming a lot more vocal about what they buy - previously they had put up with whatever was out there. But as a consumer purchasing group they are a lot more discerning these days. We thought there was a gap in the market.""Ms McCartney was given access to the group's ""performance fabric library"" which includes fabrics designed to feel like cotton but which dry more quickly. ""It's dry-release fabric and uses what we call 'moisture whicking' to make sure the athlete stays dry,"" says Mr Sweeney.Adidas originally believed that limiting a designer used to working with natural fabrics to high-tech, man-made materials would be ""more of a limitation than it was"", he says. In fact, he says Ms McCartney made the group think about its materials in a different way.Adidas is hopeful the latest collection will be as successful as an earlier spring-summer range, which was initially launched in the US and Japan with limited availability in Europe. At Bloomingdales in New York the range sold out in one day. ""We're starting to think about it as the best launch in the history of the company,"" says Mr Sweeney.The collection is more expensive than other Adidas women's products and, although womenswear is a relatively small part of the group's portfolio, the company sees it as a fast growing market. ""It's still relatively small when compared with the core business,"" says Mr Sweeney. ""But having said that, we could have sold four times the amount of product [of the first collection] than we did. We don't want to overexpose it.""The group is also limiting the range to specific outlets, which Michael Michalsky, Adidas' global creative director, says will protect the brand. ""We have to take into account where the consumers we want to attract are shopping,"" he says.In marketing terms, the company is in uncharted territory, introducing sporting products to an audience more likely to read Vogue than Runner's World. At the same time, linking its credibility as a sports brand to a fashion designer could arguably lose it some kudos among athletes and keep-fit fanatics. ""Stella McCartney is an innovative choice,"" says Karen Earl, managing director of Karen Earl Sponsorship, the sports marketing consultancy. ""She has credibility in the fashion world but I'm not sure how much she has in sport.""Yet Ms Earl says the deal is taking Adidas in the right direction. ""It would seem that Adidas has realised that to broaden their reach they are going to have to add to the technical credibility that they have always relied on.""Mr Sweeney says he is confident that the ""brand can stretch. We can get into a conversation with a buyer at Selfridges or Isetan [in Tokyo] and they want to carry a range that bears the Adidas logo.""Its rivals take a slightly different approach. Reebok, for instance, has enlisted hip-hop artists such as 50 Cent to wear its shoes and appear in its television commercials. Nike, however, continues to stress its sports credentials - although the latest interactive campaign on its website features unknown footballers performing a bewildering array of tricks in a street setting.Adidas and Nike are vying to be the number one sports brand and are in a permanent race to sign up the hottest young sporting talents. The latest Adidas television commercial for its F50 football boot has Chelsea's Arjen Robben and Arsenal's Ashley Cole chasing a ball through a park. Nike's campaign for its new ""Free"" shoe stars tennis champion Roger Federer, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney and the Kenyan marathon team.Adidas has recognised the need to keep refreshing its sporting credentials and has created innovative commercials. Last week the group won a prize for best television sports commercial at the annual Sports Industry awards for ""Laila"", which showed boxing legend Muhammad Ali sparring with his daughter Laila. Previous commercials have shown Ali training with the likes of David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane, who are also sponsored by Adidas.Ms Earl says Adidas has got its marketing message right. ""When I first came into this industry, which was years ago, Adidas was the leading sports brand. Hörst Dassler [the son of the group's founder, Adi] was the first one to get Adidas boots worn by football teams at the World Cup.""When he died, though, the company took a bit of a dive and other brands like Nike began to catch up. But in the last five or 10 years it has gained a lot of credibility and the McCartney deal is obviously a step in the right direction."""
788;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-04-26T16:32:23Z;Safe path in media minefield;;"Faced with a series of noisy protests over the past three weeks, Japanese consumer goods companies could be forgiven for feeling slightly nervous about their Chinese business.Yet while chief executives have been fretting about calls to boycott their products, marketing experts believe there is no need for panic. ""There is no evidence that sales of Japanese consumer goods are being affected in the short term,"" insists Mark Patterson, head of the Asia operation of MindShare, a media buying agency owned by WPP, the marketing services giant.Although he has urged clients to leave their media plans unchanged, Mr Patterson suggests that Japanese companies step up consumer research on the impact of anti-Japanese sentiment.""The problem is that people, particularly in China, will tell you what you want to hear, rather than what they actually buy,"" he says. ""Our experience suggests that most Chinese are not ready to ditch their Japanese mobile phones because of ideology.""Mr Patterson is no stranger to tricky situations. During the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, he advised international clients to shift advertising spending from television and newspapers to online media, because ""people turned to the internet for information and communication"".It is only one example of how MindShare is trying to steer international clients through the minefield that is China's media market.The company, which counts Unilever, Ford, Nike and Pepsi among its clients, boasts a six per cent share of China's highly fragmented media buying market. Last year, the company spent about $700m on behalf of clients, mostly on traditional media such as television, newspapers and magazines.While international media buying groups account for about a quarter of annual advertising spending in China, more than 100,000 small media brokers account for the remainder.This fragmentation has allowed CCTV, the state-owned television network, to become the country's dominant seller of broadcast advertising.To improve its bargaining position, MindShare has emphasised its list of international clients, who tend to spend a disproportionate amount of their marketing budgets on national television campaigns.""CCTV is trying to attract more multinational clients, because they help the network to lift its brand value inside and outside of China,"" says Mr Patterson.Still, for a truly national television campaign, CCTV is only one part of the puzzle owing to its comparatively weak viewing figures in southern China.""There are 2,200 channels and 36 stations, including CCTV, provincial satellite television, provincial terrestrial television and city television,"" says Mr Patterson. ""The biggest challenge for us is to optimise the investment efficiency across these different layers.""Another problem is the lack of reliable media consumption data outside big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. To collect data in the far-flung corners of the country, MindShare has joined forces with an unlikely promoter of market forces - the Communist Youth League of China, which is mandatory for high-school students to join.""Once you go beyond the top 25 cities, you have to use less advanced research tools,"" says Mr Patterson. ""We are paying [Youth League] members to record their media consumption in diaries.""MindShare is also seeking to promote its ability to pool buying power within WPP, which has three competing media buying agencies in China, including the recently acquired Mediacom.""We go into the big annual negotiations with vendors as a group, which allows us to do a deal based on combined market share,"" says Mr Patterson.In China, the group counts Nestlé's Nescafé as well as Kraft's Maxwell House, its arch rival, among its clients. It reflects a global consolidation in the media buying market, which is dominated by four marketing services giants, which include WPP, Omnicom, IPG and Publicis.""One of the big challenges is conflict management,"" admits Mr Patterson.Still, the main challenge is to execute clients' strategies in difficult markets such as China, where salary levels are rising and staff loyalty is dwindling. It does not help that media buying agencies offer ""a lot of scope"" for bribery and corruption.""You have got companies that are spending a lot of money, and you have media vendors who will do all sorts of things to get a bigger share of these budgets,"" says Mr Patterson. ""You cannot stamp out corruption, but you have to develop a reputation for not tolerating it.""According to the company's rules, employees have to declare gifts worth more than Rmb500 ($60). Typical forms of bribery include cards for automated teller machines, houses and cars.MindShare says that it has had to sack corrupt employees ""on a relatively regular basis"". As Mr Patterson puts it: ""By the standards of our business, Hong Kong is extremely clean, while Taiwan and China are not."""
789;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-04-25T20:34:19Z;Merger and earnings news boosts Wall St;;A merger in the energy sector and upbeat earnings news gave Wall Street stocks a boost on Monday after a volatile previous week.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 10,242.47 and 1,162.10, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 1,150.78.Multiple merger announcements helped lift sentiment, while crude prices, which rebounded to more than $55 per barrel in intraday trade, failed to dent the gains.Marc Pado, US markets analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, warned investors not to “expect any clarity” following an extremely volatile stretch last week. He said the jittery mood could make for a very slow summer period in the market.Ken Tower, chief analyst at CyberTrader, said last week was “likely to be a bottom” but cautioned that “the bulls still have a lot of work to establish an up trend”.In corporate news, shares of Valero Energy rose 1.1 per cent to $75.87 after the company said it would take over Premcor for $8bn. Shares in Premcor gained 18.1 per cent to $69.70.MCI shares eased 0.1 per cent to $26.67 after the company indicated a preference for the latest bid from Qwest Communications over one from Verizon Communications. Qwest and Verizon were both virtually unchanged at $3.55 and $34.06, respectively.Also in the telecommunications sector, SBC Communications shares gained 0.5 per cent to $23.32 after the carrier reported lower quarterly earnings but exceeded operating profit estimates.Among financial-related stocks, Archipelago Holdings stock shares fell 8.4 per cent to $27.25 amid signs at the weekend that its merger with the New York Stock Exchange faced opposition.In other deal news, DoubleClick shares fell 5.3 per cent to $8.12 after the internet advertising company said it agreed to be taken over by Hellman & Friedman, a private equity group.In the retail sector, OfficeMax shares added 1.1 per cent to $32.82 after the retailer of office equipment settled a proxy fight with K Capital, a private equity firm. Staples and Office Depot, two rivals, were up 1.8 per cent at $19.84 and 0.7 per cent at $20.45, respectively.Among Dow components, Boeing shares rose 2.9 per cent to $59.58 after the aerospace group announced a $6bn commercial jetliner deal with Air Canada. Boeing has been lagging behind Europe’s Airbus in orders for commercial jets.Other companies reporting earnings included Kimberly-Clark, the toilet tissue and paper group, whose shares edged off 0.5 per cent to $63.24 after the company reported in-line quarterly profits and issued a cautious guidance.Reebok International, the athletic footwear company, saw shares gain 1.5 per cent to $42.64 after it reported a 11 per cent increase in sales last quarter. Nike, its rival, put on 0.7 per cent to $78.33.
790;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Michael Skapinker: A new age of social responsibility;;"Scepticism is usually in order when companies boast how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract manufacturers on the internet is harder to dismiss. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to engage with their critics.Are there activists who want to know how workers at Nike supplier Shanghai Big River Knitwears are treated? They could follow them home from the factory at 2799 Humin Road and ask them. For any campaigners desperate to find out how Moroccan workers are faring, a visit to the Klim-Tex plant at 49 Rue Jean Jaures, Casablanca might be a good start.The workers might not talk, of course. As Nike confesses in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to establish precisely what is happening at the 800-odd factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract. Many of the factories are remote and some employ over 10,000 people. While factories receive visits both from Nike monitors and from the US-based Fair Labor Association, the company concedes the process ""is at times an overwhelming and incomplete body of work"".Hannah Jones, Nike's vice-president for corporate responsibility, accepts that publishing the factory list carries some risk. But if anyone uncovers sexual harassment or falsification of overtime records at any of the factories, she insists Nike wants to hear about it.Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists too. Ms Jones says Nike would like to see the best-run contract factories using their status as suppliers to the big brands to bid for more work.The publication of Nike's report last week followed three years of quiet after the California Supreme Court ruled that the company could be sued by an activist over its social responsibility claims. (The case was settled with Nike agreeing to donate $1.5m to the Fair Labor Association.)Ms Jones says the company sees business benefits from its new openness. She cites the Nike Considered shoe range as an example. Designed in an attempt to meet consumer demand for a product containing fewer toxic chemicals, the shoe the company ended up making consumed less material and energy.Seen in this light, Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170m that Wal-Mart made in charitable donations last year is a good example of first-age corporate responsibility, as is the $35m the retail giant last week announced it was giving to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to preserve natural habitats. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate largesse, arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits and paying dividends, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make. But Wal-Mart's plight demonstrates the dangers of failing to listen to voices other than shareholders.While Wal-Mart's sales rose 12 per cent last year to an extraordinary $256bn, opposition to proposed new stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Cleveland is frustrating its drive for continued growth. The critics object to what they claim are Wal-Mart's low wages and its tight-fisted approach to employee healthcare benefits. Charitable donations cut no ice with the objectors.In an open letter published as an advertisement in the New York Review of Books recently, Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, said: ""To be honest, most of us at Wal-Mart have been so busy minding the store that the way our critics have tried to turn us into a political symbol has taken us by surprise.""That is probably a bigger admission than Mr Scott intended. Knowing when you are in danger of becoming a political symbol is an essential component of modern management. It was the desire to avoid such nasty surprises that propelled many companies into corporate responsibility's second age: reputation management and risk avoidance.Second-age corporate responsibility advocates say knowing what is on campaigners' minds is as important to a company's health as protecting it from fraud. An activists' campaign that attracts public support can do huge damage to a company and its shareholders: witness Monsanto's failure to anticipate the intense European opposition to genetically modified food. Many now believe engagement with the wider community can alert a company to future risks. It is also a means of building up a store of goodwill to draw on if the company's reputation is ever threatened.Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories that ensure workers are registered for social security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others.If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together devise common standards that help contract manufacturers cut costs, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which makes life difficult for the many factories that manufacture for more than one brand. One company might insist a manufacturer mount a fire extinguisher five feet up the wall. Another might say the extinguisher should be placed on the floor.Each company also conducts its own inspections: one European contract manufacturer was inspected 40 times in a year by the different companies it worked for. If other companies published their manufacturing sites, they could devise common standards and save money by relying on one another's inspections. All this points to a strong element of self-interest in Nike's new openness - but practitioners of third age corporate responsibility see nothing wrong with that.michael.skapinker@ft.com"
791;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-04-18T17:21:25Z;Ethics come into fashion;;"Last week's decision by Nike to publish the names and locations of more than 700 suppliers that manufacture its goods was designed to help the world's largest sportswear group highlight its adherence to ethical working practices in developing countries.In the 1990s, Nike was dogged by allegations that some of its products were made in sweatshop conditions and even by child labour.When it comes to ethical conduct and social responsibility, fashion brands have often had a poor track record because outsourcing to low-cost contractors in developing countries typically resulted in arms-length relationships between brand owners and producers, making labour practices harder to police.Nike's latest move to counter such allegations has come a month after the launch of Edun, a fashion label that places its ethical practices at the heart of its brand. The line of organic cotton shirts, jeans and hemp blazers was launched by U2's Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson, as an attempt to prove the commercial viability of ethical fashion.By working to ensure that their products have a positive rather than negative impact on the people and places where they are made, companies such as Edun are trying to do for fashion what the Body Shop did for the cosmetics and beauty industry.However, the growing band of fashion businesses highlighting their ethical practices face significant branding and marketing challenges. Brand owners must not only substantiate any ethical claims they make; they also risk being criticised by consumers for cynically exploiting doing the right thing for commercial gain.Richard Cervera, Edun's chief executive, is under no illusion about how difficult it is for a brand to live up to such promises. ""The extent to which ethical codes of conduct within the fashion industry are adhered to is variable,"" he says. ""Even where practices are sound there is a tendency to switch production frequently to achieve the cheapest prices, so relationships between brand owners and their producers in developing countries are short term.""The company, which is based in Dublin, uses non-subsidised cotton to boost the local economies of the developing world countries where its products are produced and sourced. A primary aim is to support the African businesses making Edun products through close partnerships and business development support. The company's website includes live camera feeds from the factories where its clothes are made.""The fashion business is uniquely suited to addressing third-world issues because of its increasing reliance on outsourcing,"" says Mr Cervera. ""Working conditions can be ethically appraised, and who a brand such as ours conducts business with - and which brands consumers choose to buy - has a significant impact.""The company is not alone. Its clothing line has been created with Rogan Gregory, the New York-based designer whose Rogan label recently introduced a line of organic cotton clothing called Loom State. Other ethical fashion brands include US-based American Apparel, which has its own outlets in Germany, France and the UK as well as the US and Canada. It has grown rapidly in the two years since it introduced a ""no sweatshops"" policy.Meanwhile, Katherine Hamnett, a leading British fashion designer, is to launch her own ethical range this autumn. Shocked by the fashion industry's lack of concern about the economic and environmental damage caused by industrialised cotton production, Ms Hamnett has spent the past 18 months assembling a new supply chain based on certified organic cotton and ethical manufacturing.Many industry observers believe the time is right for such fashion brands to move into the mainstream, buoyed by the marketing value of their ethical stances. ""A brand's true value today isn't just about profit and loss. Increasingly it's about accountability - being able to demonstrate clearly where and how a product was made,"" says Martin Raymond, futures director of London-based trends forecaster The Future Laboratory. ""There has been growing acknowledgment that brands can leverage their position internationally by being ethical.""However, opinion is divided over the extent to which corporate ethics should be employed in branding and marketing.Ben Wood, director of Added Value, a Paris-based strategic marketing agency, argues against aligning brands with a business's ethical stance: ""There's now a growing expectation that companies should behave ethically as a matter of course - that to sell your brand as ethical is a cynical exploitation of good business practice.""He also argues that consumers' interest in corporate ethics varies across products. ""Fashion is primarily about style and aesthetics,"" he explains. ""The sexiness of a brand will always be more important to the consumer than any socially responsible, positive message.""Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, agrees. The company bucked the fashion industry trend for outsourcing in 2002 when it began producing its products in downtown Los Angeles with a commitment to pay its workers a fair wage. But while ethics have played a central role in the brand's marketing since then, the current emphasis is on the products' fit and sense of fun.""Often, ethics are paraded to create attention,"" says Mr Charney. ""Even Wal-Mart is talking about social responsibility in its marketing in the US now. We've moved on. Our social philosophy is still there, but it is not - and never has been - the point of our brand: product comes first. As a fashion brand you must accept ethics will always be a secondary issue to consumers' self-interest.""Ms Hamnett, on the other hand, says she wants her brand to be closely associated with social and environmental responsibility. ""If you are behaving ethically you might as well talk about it, as long as you have made sure there are no chinks in your ethical practices,"" she argues. ""Openness and honesty are the best route - even when a business is not as ethical as it would like to be. So addressing this in your marketing seems a natural step.""Others add that changing consumer opinions will soon force many fashion brands to use their ethical practices more overtly in their brand communications. ""The danger is saying nothing,"" says Steve Hilton, founding partner of Good Business, a London-based corporate responsibility consultancy. ""Keep silent and you leave yourself open to criticism that you just don't care.""Evidence suggests that consumers, especially younger ones, do care about where and how the clothes they buy are made.Just how brand owners use their ethics in marketing, however, remains a conundrum. Mr Hilton says that while the Body Shop is now seen worldwide as an ethical brand, the origin of this was its pledge not to test its products on animals.""Simply claiming you're ethical is very risky,"" he says. ""It is far better to be precise and specific. Generalise and you invite people to pick holes in your claim. Your product may be manufactured ethically, but what about every other aspect of the rest of your business?""He says the closely controlled use of ethics in brand marketing can deflect criticism that a brand owner is simply being ethical to make more money.""It should not be about grabbing headlines, it should be about choosing the media channels best able to allow a brand to explain the story behind it.""At the end of the day, today's consumers want brands they believe are authentic: brands they can take pride in."""
792;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-04-12T21:03:07Z;Nike makes the step to transparency;;"Today Nike breaks a three-year silence on social reporting as it publishes its 2004 corporate responsibility report. This is Nike's first report since a 2002 California supreme court ruling that the company could be sued by Mark Kasky, a labour rights activist, over statements it made about its labour practices. But that is not all: the sports equipment company has also broken new ground in transparency by publishing a complete list of suppliers on its website.""That will garner great attention among companies that report on their supply chain practices, and it will put Nike ahead of the game,"" says Aron Cramer, president and chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, a US non-profit advisory group whose membership includes many leading multinationals.Nike's return to social reporting - particularly with the added level of disclosure in listing its suppliers - provides a forceful counter-argument to those who suggested the Kasky ruling would discourage corporate transparency.""We felt the risks of any future lawsuit were far outweighed by benefits of transparency,"" says Hannah Jones, Nike's vice-president of corporate responsibility. ""Because if we've learnt anything as a company, it's that closing down and not talking about the challenges and opportunities doesn't get you very far.""Mr Kasky sued Nike in 1998 under California's unfair competition laws, charging that public statements defending the company's labour practices constituted false advertising. After moving through the courts, Nike eventually settled, agreeing to donate $1.5m to the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a Washington-based non-profit organisation.While Nike issued a corporate responsibility report in 2001, it held off from any further public disclosure on its supply chain. ""In 2001, as a Kasky filter, we tried to be careful,"" says Dusty Kidd, Nike's vice-president of compliance. ""But then it moved forward in the courts, and that's why we stopped reporting.""Today Nike's silence has ended. As well as providing detail on its supply chain practices, the report covers areas such as workforce diversity, the environment, community programmes and socially responsible investment. An independent review committee of individuals from trade unions, non-governmental organisations, academia and the business community was brought together to strengthen the credibility of the information in the report.Ms Jones says that the Kasky ruling, while disappointing, helped the company bring a greater degree of rigour to its reporting. ""I worked hand in hand with the legal department [on the report] and that is a good thing,"" she says. ""Because when you're being very robust and factual, you create something that moves corporate responsibility out of the reputation area and into business process, business innovation and the business case - and that's exactly the way forward.""As part of this effort to provide information, the report makes no bones about the difficulties it has encountered in managing its supply chain. In the section on workers in contract factories, for example, the authors describe the struggle to improve labour conditions. ""Despite anecdotal instances of success,"" they state, ""we remain profoundly challenged to understand how to systematically measure the impact of our own interventions"".And like the ""warts and all"" report published by Gap in May last year, Nike's report provides plenty of detail on areas such as the difficulties of ending contracts with suppliers, or factories' non-compliance with labour, environment and health and safety standards.Auret van Heerden, executive director of the FLA, believes Nike has made an impressive attempt to capture these difficulties. ""It's a new standard for social reporting in terms of the amount of information that they convey and the range of subjects that they touch on,"" he says.Nike hopes that by publishing its list of suppliers it will encourage others to do the same. The report relies heavily on the guidelines developed by the Global Reporting Initiative, a UN-backed organisation.Michael Posner, executive director of Human Rights First (formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), applauds Nike's effort to be more transparent. However, he says the report is only a start when it comes to addressing what he describes as ""chronic"" problems in the factories of apparel and footwear industry suppliers.""They've done things that are moving in the right direction,"" he says. ""But then the question is, 'what are you going to do about it?' because [Nike is] finding problems across the system."""
793;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-03-04T19:31:02Z;The tricks of a smiling assassin;;"It's hard to realise how special someone is when you see him on television all the time. Ronaldinho appears in Nike commercials, in kiss-and-tell stories in British tabloids, and in Spanish football matches. He has buck-teeth and always smiles. Often the Brazilian seems just another contemporary celebrity, like Paris Hilton or Prince Harry.You have to remind yourself that he is also a genius, a man like Van Gogh or Nijinsky who does things in a new way that works and is of great beauty. This is the only remarkable fact about him. Yet people seldom look for genius in football, instead treating the sport as a branch of the celebrity industry. The recent Champions League match between Barcelona and Chelsea, the world's two best teams, was reported largely for the quarrel between their coaches.When the teams meet again on Tuesday, with Chelsea seeking to overturn a 2-1 deficit at Stamford Bridge, better to concentrate on Ronaldinho. What makes him a genius?No footballer has ever had a greater repertoire of feints. For his favourite, the ""elastico"", he touches the ball with the outside of his right boot as if to go that way. Then, t he instant the defender shifts his weight, he takes the ball the other way with the inside of his boot. This happens so quickly that you often only see it in the slow-motion replay.But Daniel van Buyten, a former opponent, warns: ""He never does the same feint twice in a row."" Ronaldinho's arsenal includes bouncing the ball off his back over his own head; lobbing the ball over a defender's head (the ""sombrero""); or stepping over the ball and running around the defender. Once, besieged by two defenders, he lobbed the ball over his head, then turned and lobbed it the other way, then did it again.One feint, when he was still with Gremio Porto Alegre in Brazil, I watched several times before working out what had happened: Ronaldinho played the ball with his right foot behind his left leg, then, with legs virtually crossed, flicked it past the defender with that same right foot. This had probably never been done before. ""There's no better way to confuse an opponent than to invent something,"" he says.He doesn't only dribble. Once, about to receive a high pass, he suddenly turned and bounced the ball off his back to a team-mate's feet. He also plays the ""no-look pass"", which involves looking one way and passing the other. This can be comic, particularly if he is smiling. There is something of Harpo Marx about him.The only common indicator to emerge from one study of genius was the propensity to practise endlessly. Ronaldinho did this. His father was Gremio's groundsman, his elder brother played professionally, and they trained him. As a kid, Ronaldinho dribbled so much that other children would get bored of playing with him.""Luckily my dog Bombom was always ready to take over,"" he told the French newspaper L'Equipe. ""I played against him for hours. I tried all possible feints to avoid him puncturing the ball.""Even today, Ronaldinho's mansion in Barcelona is stuffed with footballs, volleyballs and basketballs. When it rains he dribbles a tennis ball through the lounge. Few professional footballers live like this. Paco Seirulo, Barcelona's physical trainer, says: ""I've never before talked to a guy with a ball stuck to his left ear.""All this play is purposeful. Ronaldinho spends hours rehearsing specific moves. Sometimes he draws inspiration from a photograph of a colleague's move. He copied the elastico from another Brazilian great, Rivelino.But possessing the technique isn't enough. There are street footballers who can do Ronaldinho's feints. What sets him apart is firstly that he uses tricks functionally - often the elastico will be followed by a defence-splitting pass - and that he dares perform them in big games. This is rare. Samuel Eto'o, Barcelona's striker, says he learnt from Ronaldinho that ""the most important thing is daring"". Henkten Cate, Barca's assistant coach, cites as an example Ronaldinho's lob over the defence for Xavi's goal against Real Madrid last April: not only did he see the pass and have the technique to play it, but also he dared hit it.The cliché is that his joy in playing is typically Brazilian: that Brazilian football is a thing set to music. This may be true. Ronaldinho says: ""I play football with melodies in my head. I listen to dance music all day and take those sounds with me on to the field. That makes me happy, and the happier I am the easier I play."""
794;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-03-02T20:15:42Z;Congested ports warning for US importers;;US importers can expect another year of supply bottlenecks and rising supply-chain costs because of congestion in west coast ports, transport industry executives and analysts have warned.Surging trade with China is increasing the strain on Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together receive nearly 80 per cent of traffic to the western US. The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents west coast ports, predicts import volumes will increase by a further 14 per cent on average this year the same rate as last year.Container ships bound for California last year had to wait offshore for several days before a berth became free, delaying deliveries to retailers and pushing up costs for carriers and shippers.The ports, with their powerful labour unions, limited working hours and outdated technology, must increase investment and productivity if further disruption is to be averted, said the executives and analysts. “The congestion we faced [in the US] last year is likely to be repeated this year,” David Lim, chief executive of Neptune Orient Lines, a Singapore-based ocean freight carrier, told a conference on trans-Pacific shipping this week. “There is a need for closer co-ordination between industry, government and other interested parties to make sure much-needed investment [in US ports] is not further delayed.”If congestion persists, routing Asian-made goods through the Suez Canal and across the Atlantic might become a viable alternative, said John Isbell, director of logistics for Nike, the sports clothing brand.Ports across Europe have also struggled to increase capacity, and analysts expect any delays on the west coast to have knock-on effects for shipping schedules and tonnage rates around the world.Shippers have sought to bypass west coast congestion by redirecting cargo through the Panama Canal to east coast ports, such as Savannah and New York. But this is pushing the canal towards full capacity and forcing sharp increases in rates.Mexican ports and more northerly west coast terminals, such as Seattle and Vancouver, have also absorbed some overspill but analysts said they were not big enough to resolve the crisis.Tom Ward, marine specialist at JWD, an architecture and engineering group, said west coast ports had room to expand but needed to hire more workers, work longer hours, introduce more advanced technology and maximise use of dockside space.Several speakers at this week's conference also called for improvement in the congested roads and railways that serve the ports, particularly around Los Angeles and Long Beach. The biggest container ships carry enough cargo to fill 27 miles of rail wagons and 60 miles of trucks. Executives from Union Pacific and BNSF, two of the main rail operators serving the west coast, said they were building new cargo-handling facilities.Jim McKenna, chief executive of the Pacific Maritime Association, said west coast ports were pushing to introduce more advanced technology this year and hiring thousands more.Additional reporting by Robert Wright
795;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-02-08T07:47:22Z;Preferring to be better than bigger;;“Cog,” the extraordinary Heath-Robinson style commercial created by Wieden+Kennedy for the Honda Accord was the most critically acclaimed ad of last year. It won Gold at Cannes, The One Show and The Clios, silver at D&AD, a Grandy at the Andys, Best of Show at the British Television Advertising awards and bags full of swag at every other award going.As if that was not enough, two more by Wieden+Kennedy for the Honda Civic, “Everyday” and “Sense,” came equal fourth in the world rankings.The agency also picked up two more golds – for advertising effectiveness from the IPA in November for its work on Honda. All the evidence suggests the gold rush is not over. Although it has won a handful of awards so far, critical reaction to “Grrr,” the feel-good animation for Honda’s i-CTDi diesel car, suggests it may fare even better than its predecessors.And now W+K can add the accolade “best small agency” in the IPA’s Bob awards to its list.To create one world-beating ad in a campaign is fortunate. But to create four classics in the same campaign within two years, suggests more than luck is involved. How did they do it? And if they are so brilliant, why does the agency have only three significant accounts?Talking to Neil Christie (pictured), W+K managing director and an astute, down-to-earth Scot, it quickly becomes apparent that, perhaps surprisingly, there is a formula – of sorts – to explain W+K’s success. “I buck against the idea that there is a magic process that explains how and why we have been successful. But if you pushed me, I suppose I would put it down to our culture, our methodology and our relationships.”It tells you everything and nothing. On closer inspection it seems to offer a plausible explanation of W+K’s creative success. It also offers the beginnings of an explanation for what many would consider W+K’s commercial underachievement.Every agency in the world claims it is engineered for creativity. But creativity really does seem to be hard-wired into W+K. “It goes right back to W+K’s inception,” says Mr Christie. “The London agency is one of six offices in the Wieden+Kennedy ‘organisation’ which was founded by two creatives, Dan Wieden and his less well-known partner David Kennedy 22 years ago in Portland Oregon.”The agency has built a reputation as one of the world’s most creative on the back of a string of consistently outstanding commercials for Nike, its biggest client.W+K remains the only network founded and managed predominantly by creatives. This model, with two creatives at the top, has been replicated at all its offices, explains Mr Christie. “Our senior management team, like those in every other W+K office, consists of two creative directors, Kim Papworth and Tony Davidson – and one suit, me.”Unlike most other companies in its competitive set, W+K has remained determinedly independent. The result is a greater focus on creativity, without having to worry about the distractions of quarterly financial reporting and double-digit growth.“I do have to meet profit margins and targets,” says Mr Christie, “but we have a different attitude to money compared to public companies that have to do whatever is necessary to hit targets. There’s no pressure here for growth for growth’s sake. But what does turn Dan [Wieden] on is fantastic work. So that’s my key ‘metric’ if you like.”Being small and independent has also left W+K free to develop its own highly collaborative and open way of working. “We don’t have that business where the client briefs the account team who brief the planner who briefs the creatives who go away for weeks and then present to the account team who in turn present to the client in a great dramatic ‘reveal’. Instead we, and that includes the client, collectively swarm over every point,” says Mr Christie.What is more, W+K tends not to write formal creative briefs at all. Rather it produces a sort of tone of voice document. So for Honda, W+K produced “The Book Of Dreams” a collection of references that summarises the look, feel and vocabulary of its advertising.And just in case you did not think the whole thing was woolly enough already, the agency rejects pre-testing as a matter of principle.Mr Christie admits it is a way of working that would fail a time and motion study. “The whole process is hugely inefficient and time-consuming. But it is highly effective.” The facts support his assertion. In three years sales of Honda cars are up 58 per cent with an unchanged media budget, and softer measures such as “desire to own a Honda” have increased by 36 per cent.For all this, even Mr Christie admits W+K could not produce work of such a high calibre for just any client. Cultural compatibility is the key. “I don’t think we could do it for everybody. A major reason we work so well together is that we have very similar cultures.”His observation is backed up by Mat Coombes, Honda’s marketing communications manager. “The fact that both companies are independent free thinkers, dedicated to our craft and risk-takers is vital to our collaboration,” he says. W+K may have been brilliant at building Honda’s business but it has been less than scintillating when it comes to building its own. True, it now bills £50m and it is a top 30 agency.But after seven years it still has only three big clients – Nike, Aiwa and Honda. There is a general feeling that given the agency’s heritage, it has underperformed.“Somehow they’ve never quite got it together on the new business front. They don’t seem to be able to get their business model to run across a wide range of clients,” says one rival agency manager.There are a variety of theories on offer to explain this. One has it that W+K’s establishment in London seven years ago was a defensive move by the parent company to protect its Nike business in the UK.Others suggest the proximity of a far larger and more vigorous Amsterdam office in the W+K network somehow took the wind out of its sails. A third strand of thought has it that the Americans were too arrogant. “They thought they could come over here and do it their way. But London is very different and what works in the US doesn’t necessarily work here.”What is certain is that in its first four years, W+K London had four changes of senior management. Only in the past couple of years does it seem to have acquired stability at the top. “There is a need to bring in new clients if only to present new challenges to the people here,” says Mr Christie.But he rejects suggestions that W+K has not succeeded. “The fact is that we work in our own way. We place a greater emphasis on quality. And by that yardstick we have done very well indeed.”However he admits that the agency does need to improve its new business record – if only to provide its staff with a broader range of challenges. “We’d rather be better than bigger,” he smiles. “But a bit bigger would be good too.”Back to IPA BOB Awards - special report
796;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-01-26T21:03:40Z;John Gapper: The point of taking responsibility;;"At the height of her powers, Margaret Thatcher had a motto that encapsulated her determination to bring the discipline of the free market to Britain: coal mines had to be closed and lossmaking state-owned industries had to be privatised. There is no alternative, she used to say.Her words came to mind last week when Sony announced that its profits to the end of March would be 31 per cent lower than it expected earlier this year. It blames the decline on falling prices in consumer electronics, caused by the move to digital products. These are now so easy to assemble from standard parts that Sony cannot maintain the premium it commanded in the analogue world.There is another reason for this consumer bonanza: televisions, music players and phones are mostly made in China. As a subtle new documentary on how Nokia tries to ensure that its Chinese suppliers do not break labour laws shows, there is no alternative. When the monthly wages for workers in Shenzhen are less than £40 a month, it is nearly impossible for most other countries to compete. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, that leads to some soul-searching. Since Nike got into trouble for allowing the exploitation of workers in Asian factories, corporate social responsibility has become all the rage. For a week on a Swiss hillside, bosses talk earnestly about their commitment to good causes such as environmental protection and the employment of workers on decent terms.It is tempting to dismiss such talk as merely well-meaning guff intended to placate the campaigners and non-governmental organisations that prowl around Davos. No chief executive would admit to exploiting workers, but the point of assembling products in China is to exploit a wage disparity with the west. Nokia's products would be very expensive if they were made in Finland.Milton Friedman, one of Lady Thatcher's favourite economic gurus, believes that companies should not get a guilty conscience over where the global market leads them. His assertion that ""the one and only social responsibility of business is to make profits"" is quoted at the start of Made in China,the film directed by Thomas Balmès, backed by the BBC and Finnish and French television.Prof Friedman's scepticism has a lot to be said for it. Governments are in a better position than companies to make judgments about minimum employment standards. Most of the women employed at the Shenzhen supplier of phone chargers seen in the film live in dormitories near the factory and are paid the minimum wage - equivalent to £36 a month - before deductions for food and housing.That would be a scandal in Bremen or Swindon, but there is no better alternative in China, as one woman worker points out. Living off the land in an inland province would not provide such rewards: ""We have fields, but fields do not pay any more."" By coming to China for its chargers, Nokia is improving their lot.It is clearly unwise for any company operating a global supply chain to ignore the terms on which its suppliers employ their workers. As Hanna Kaskinen, Nokia's ""ethical and environmental specialist"", tells senior executives: ""Nokia is a big company - the spotlight is on us all the time - so it is absolutely vital that we treat this issue as very important.""But treating Chinese workers fairly in order to avoid adverse publicity, or a public backlash, is a matter of prudence rather than morality. Most senior executives grasp the logic of not becoming targets for activists, and human resource managers often sell corporate social responsibility to them in these terms. By implication, the important thing is not to be ethical, but to be seen to be ethical.Maybe that comes to the same thing in practice, but it accounts for the air of cynicism that pervades a lot of CSR initiatives. That becomes plain in Shenzhen when Nokia's team of (female) ethicists arrives to inspect the conditions of the (female) workers and confronts a group of (male) managers whose attitudes vary from weary resignation to irritation at this intrusion of do-goodery.""To be frank with you, you cannot replace these girls. Very reliable, low maintenance,"" says the British factory manager, as he stands by two women workers measuring lengths of cable (the managers were so open because they thought the crew was making an internal Nokia film). Yet the visitors find nothing very disturbing; by Chinese standards, the managers are running a humane factory.So is there a point to such exercises, beyond keeping activists off companies' backs? Actually, as Made in China shows, there is. Prof Friedman is correct that a company achieves things for society by performing its basic task of making money for its shareholders. No company should be distracted by a misguided effort to become a paragon of social respectability.But the objective of Nokia's managers was more modest: to make sure that its supplier was sticking to local labour laws. This can hardly be faulted, given that corporate customers such as Nokia determine how well suppliers can afford to treat their workers. It would be hypocritical - unethical, in fact - for the paymaster to shrug off responsibility.There is something distasteful about companies grandstanding about their ethical standards, but there is nothing wrong with their doing their bit to ensure that those they indirectly employ are treated humanely. Prof Friedman thinks companies have no business trying to ensure the world is a decent place. But for a 21st century global company there is no alternative.john.gapper@ft.com"
797;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

At his inauguration on Thursday, Bush will ride in a brand-new Cadillac, the marque that US presidents have used since President Woodrow Wilson rode through the streets of Boston in a first world war victory parade.Two Cadillac convertibles, each weighing more than 3 tons and nicknamed the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth, were used for more than two decades by presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower. Alas, the days of a president riding in a convertible are gone. The latest armour-plated model has six passenger seats, and includes a fold-away desktop and a 10-disc CD player, not to mention an array of communications and security devices.While General Motors is providing the limousine, the president is unlikely to turn to the carmaker for his security detail. A bodyguard escorting GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz was slightly injured and enormously embarrassed at the Los Angeles Auto Show this month when his gun accidentally went off in its holster. As one GM insider puts it: ""Much more than his backside is bruised"".Guarded budgetingEven in the best of times, Josh Bolten, director of the Office of Management and Budget, knows he is not the most popular person in Washington. But as he was putting the finishing touches to the White House's budget proposal, Bolten said ""at this moment I'm probably the least popular person in Washington"".With lots of tough choices to be made among federal programmes and departments before the spending plan goes to the printer, Bolten is clearly feeling the heat.""I think I'm the only cabinet officer that does not have a security detail,"" he told the US Chamber of Commerce. ""I may be the one most in need of one, and I think the biggest threat may be coming from the other cabinet officers' security details.""Left out?All this talk among Democrats about building a ""progressive infrastructure"" is getting serious. The Center for American Progress, a new leftwing think-tank, is today opening the doors to an in-house radio studio.John Podesta, the Clintonite who runs the centre, says the studio was built to encourage radio talk show hosts to visit Washington and meet big-thinking liberals - all to counter the dominance of conservative chat on the airwaves.Inaugural week (for both the studio and the president) will be a busy one. Up first will be Ed Schultz, whose web-site, bigeddieradio.com, describes his ""pull-no-punches, progressive and informed personality"". Stephanie Miller, a radio host who says she is happy to fill the ""leftwing wacko"" gap, will also broadcast from the studio. Al Franken and his friends from Air America radio (remember them?) will be there, too. At least a few Democrats are brave enough to visit Washington this week.Fat chanceHats off to the organisers of the National Retail Federation's annual show in New York. At a panel on Monday entitled ""Maximising the Power of Your Brand"", Jim Beeman, Nike's account marketing director, promoted the values of athleticism. He ended his speech with a rousing video for the sneaker maker's ""You're faster than you think"" campaign that featured sprinters, athletes and school children moving at great speed.He was followed by Dorrit Bern, chief executive of Charmy Shoppes, which includes the Lane Bryant brand of plus-size fashion for women. Bern has been a forceful advocate for oversized women, criticising the daily barrage of pro-skinny commercials - not unlike Nike's new spot.But here's where the NRF went against type: Bern is a tall, thin woman who could have easily outsprinted Nike's Beeman.Toilet talkIs Mickey Mouse facing competition from a cherub?Georgia-Pacific's paper products, which include Angel Soft toilet paper and Brawny paper towels, are now going to be used at Disney theme parks in a new 10-year ""marketing partnership"".

No word on whether there will be special towels to clean up the mess revealed by the Disney shareholder lawsuit.Less stressedNobody has to tell business owners about stress. But those in the US should fret a little less: they're comparatively not that stressed.According to a study released on Tuesday by Grant Thornton, US business owners rank 18 in a global stress study. This puts them behind Spain and France but ahead of the UK. Taiwan leads the list with a whopping 69 per cent saying their stress has gone up, followed by Hong Kong, Mexico and Turkey at 54 per cent. Lounging at the back is Sweden with stress level of a mere 23 per cent.The top four stress cases come from ""low growth, high stress"" economies, where owners are worried about competition, the economy in general and pressure on cash flow and profits. The Swedes, on the other hand, are ""low stress, low growth"" people who ""take a pragmatic approach to life"". As for the US, it's a ""high growth, low stress"" place where owners ""know how to cope with the success without becoming too stressed by it"".Silver serviceLondon's Savoy Hotel has long prided itself as the financier's canteen.

799;NKE;Nike Inc;2005-01-17T18:31:17Z;The King is dead, long live the King;;"The King may have been dead for more than 27 years, but the power of his music is undiminished. Sony BMG, which owns the rights to Elvis Presley's recorded catalogue, has pumped new life into a once-bloated frame in a textbook study in brand resuscitation.To mark what would have been Presley's 70th birthday on January 8, the record company launched a series of reissued British number one singles, with original artwork, available in limited edition CD and 10in vinyl formats.The results have been impressive. The day after Elvis's birthday,""Jailhouse Rock"" returned to number one. Last Sunday his 1959 chart-topper ""One Night"" replaced it at the top, winning a further publicity bonus as the 1,000th bestseller in British chart history.This is not the first attempt to revive the King. In 2002, the pre-merger BMG used the impending 25th anniversary of his death to mount its highest-profile Elvis marketing campaign, and the momentum has grown from there.The coup of an advertising tie-in with Nike led to global chart-topping success with a remix of his obscure 1960s track ""A Little Less Conversation"". That prepared the ground for the release of 30 #1 Hits, a compilation that Sony BMG says has now sold more than 10m copies worldwide.Sony BMG is confident of high chart positions for all of its remaining re-releases between now and April.The company astutely anticipated that the fresh attention to Presley from both media and public would drown out the whimper of a less impressive commercial reality.""Jailhouse Rock"" was able to reach number one with first-week sales of just 21,262 copies, the lowest UK figure recorded for a chart-topping single. On Sunday, ""One Night"" lowered the bar even further, with an opening tally of 20,463 units.The new year is a traditionally soft period for recorded music, and the retail singles market is in sharp decline. Yet the number one slot retains a cachet far beyond the lamentably low sales figures that can now win it. Darren Henderson, Sony BMG marketing director, admits that the reissue campaign is a means to an end.""Yes, it is a marketing exercise, of course it is,"" he says. ""It just so happens it captured the imagination of the media and the fans. We feel we've begun to get another new generation buying into Elvis.""By the mid 1980s, the Elvis catalogue was gathering a thin layer of dust. Its reawakening contains lessons for other brand managers, according to Brent Green of Brent Green & Associates, a Colorado-based marketing, communications and consulting company.""You must never lose sight of the fact that customers are always changing and cannot assume that everybody automatically gets the brand,"" says Mr Green.""That means it must be repackaged - and that doesn't mean reinvented if it is a good brand - for the constant parade of new customers while never losing sight of the core customers. We saw Coca-Cola blow it on that basis when they introduced New Coke.""Last summer, before the Sony merger, BMG set down a marker for the initiative, using the 50th anniversary of rock and roll to justify promoting Presley's debut single from 1954, ""That's All Right Mama"". It sold 18,799 copies in its first week.""That enabled us to gauge the amount of market potential in reissuing Elvis singles,"" says Mr Henderson. He adds that sales from box sets and other albums indicate a die-hard Elvis fanbase in the UK of between 15,000 and 20,000 people. ""We could pretty much calculate how many singles we would sell week by week. We will continue to sell approximately 20,000 to 25,000 every week.""Underlining the proactive stance of Sony BMG's UK division, the UK market is the only one in which the singles campaign is taking place.""There aren't many other territories that could sustain what we've done and retain a [profit] margin as well,"" notes Mr Henderson.While Sony BMG owns Presley's recorded output, his name and likeness are owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises, now in new hands after Lisa Marie, his daughter and sole heir, sold 85 per cent of the company last month for $100m to Robert Sillerman, a US businessman.It is Elvis's overweight image of his later years that could have presented a problem for the marketeers. But it has not.""Our absolute intention was to get away from that clichéd image of him,"" says Mr Henderson. ""We made a conscious effort to market the cool Elvis rather than the Vegas Elvis."""

Mr Bell had 28 years? experience at McDonald?s, having started working part-time in a Sydney store at the age of 15.Energetic and affable, he was credited with both implementing the back-to-basics strategy at store level, and bringing new thinking on marketing. He oversaw the introduction of the ?I?m Lovin? It? campaign - the first time McDonald?s had an advertising campaign with a single global slogan.He brought broad international experience, having become a member of McDonald?s Australia board of directors at 29, and having spent 10 years with McDonald?s Europe before returning to McDonald?s Australia as managing director in 1993. He introduced ideas such as McCafe, which became the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand and was introduced to McDonald?s elsewhere.At McDonald?s headquarters in Chicago, Mr Bell worked on updated designs for McDonald?s restaurants, drawing inspiration from revamps carried out by McDonald?s in France. He aimed to make McDonald?s a hip, lifestyle brand along the lines of Apple or Nike.Andrew McKenna, the company?s chairman, said Mr Bell?s death was a tragic loss.?Charlie Bell gave his all to McDonald?s. Even during his hospitalisation and chemotherapy, Charlie led this company with pride and determination,? Mr McKenna said. ?Now he leaves a remarkable legacy…It began with his partnership with Jim Cantalupo and Jim Skinner [current chief executive] to create a strategic Plan to Win. It continued with his intense and highly successful focus on the customer experience that all started in a McDonald?s restaurant in Australia.?Jim Skinner described Mr Bell as ?an incredible leader?.
801;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-12-07T07:10:09Z;Beating the brandals;;A few years ago, a Microsoft poster near Liverpool Street station that originally read “Suddenly Everything Clicks” was altered to read “Suddenly Everything Sucks”.The term “brandalism” has been used to describe this behaviour. It represents a consumer backlash against corporations who present a brand image that they don’t live up to in their behaviour.In the US last year, Casey Neistat, a New York artist angered by Apple’s battery replacement policy for the iPod, defaced every iPod billboard he could find in Manhattan with the words “iPod’s unreplaceable battery lasts only 18 months” and placed a film of his antics on the internet. A million web users clicked on to his site. It was not long before Apple called Neistat to inform him that they had started a new battery replacement programme.What this “brandal” demonstrated was the power of the individual to force brands to sit up and listen. There are three trends that give the consumer the power to brandalise. First, through the internet, people can communicate with millions of fellow-consumers at almost no cost. Second, there is a growing distrust of big corporations, especially among young consumers. The anti-globalisation movement, and books such as No Logo, have popularised the perception that a brand is often little more than a pretty face for a grubby global corporation. Third, the increasing cynicism among consumers toward advertising.Brandals have targeted corporate giants such as Nike and McDonald’s, while organisations such as Adbusters, the anti-ad website, encourage consumers to generate spoof ads and post their efforts on the web.On the face of it, all this seems worrying for brands. However, brandalism actually stems from people’s willingness to interact with branded communications, and it’s important to realise that this presents fascinating opportunities for companies and brands.This opportunity is “open source communication”: where consumers work with an advertiser to create a piece of communication. Brands are taking advantage of increasingly sophisticated forms of open source communication, allowing consumers to contribute to communications and become part of the brand. Open source is the opposite of brandalism. It’s a way of making the company’s values appear deeper and more genuine. When this happens, brand ceases to be image. It becomes behaviour. A simplistic execution of this might be a poster which has a gap for consumers to fill in themselves.Another example is Hewlett-Packard’s “Hype Gallery”, which launched in a gallery in Shoreditch at the start of this year. HP wanted to bolster the creative credentials of its imaging and printing technology among digital artists. While HP could have just produced an ad campaign in some specialist magazines, it realised that the creative community would not respond positively. So HP invented a new medium: The Hype Gallery - an on- and offline exhibition where digital artists could exhibit their work for nothing. Understanding the climate of corporate mistrust, the request for submissions to the gallery made no mention of Hewlett-Packard and imposed no restrictions, except that the letters H and P appear in the title of the artwork. Did the artists feel hoodwinked when they discovered that Hype was a Hewlett Packard hidden persuader? No, because it was an equal exchange. HP had provided a platform for unknown artists and the artists provided the creative work.Other major brands in the US, including Mercedes, KFC and Coors have recognised the value of open source by allowing consumers to participate actively in the creation of their advertising.The Roman philosopher Seneca noticed that at the heart of every frustration lies a basic structure: the collision of a wish or promise with an unyielding reality. Brandalism is an expression of a consumer’s frustration that a brand’s promise has no relationship with its behaviour. Companies that fail to live up to their brand risk a backlash. Beware. There are plenty of brandals out there.benr@nakedcomms.comfaris@nakedcomms.comBen Richards and Faris Yakob are strategists at Naked Communications

""[Ralph] is a West Pointer, Army. I am a sailor. We have competed against each other for a position for 20 years,"" he says, referring to the top spot at Northrop Grumman, which both failed to grab.""He has been rough on me. I have been rough on him. It is quite combative.""On the other hand, he is also very admirable. He is the only person I know who can actually take apart a Ferrari and rebuild it. I have admired that for years,"" says Roche, who steers powerboats and Ferraris when not being ferried to the Pentagon in a government Cadillac. (Roche called his Ferrari his ""Bella Macchina"".)When it comes to more cerebral matters, however, Roche sees himself as the better man: ""I think my Shakespeare is probably a lot better than his"" - a sturdy statement given that he admits Crosby ""is a dead-eye shot with a rifle"".In the end, Roche says Crosby has earned his respect for his management of EADS: ""There are things you do in the heat of battle.""We have all come from the industry and it is a rough and tumble industry.

""Stick to the IBM image we put forward since IBM's turnaround: The customer comes first, IBM second, your unit third, everything else later."" Or for the more reflective employees there is this mantra: ""Always ask yourself: is my statement to the long-term benefit of IBM, will my quote be appreciated by senior IBM management.""The best one could be: ""Don't speak openly against a standard IBM position (ie the era of the PC being over)""Spelling beeThe Central Intelligence Agency has caved in: South Korea's president can spell his name the way he wants.Having updated its website last week, the CIA has abandoned the ""No Mu-hyun"" spelling - to which South Korea objected - for Roh Moo-hyun.That would seem to be enough to make everyone happy, but transliteration is, after all, a tricky, if not downright dark art. And the South Korean newsagency Yonhap has pointed out that the CIA is still wrong on several spellings.Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, is known as Kim Chong-il. And the spy agency uses something called the ""McCune-Reischauer system of romanisation"" in spelling provincial names, ignoring the government's official spellings.Then again, the CIA may know something it doesn't.Double dribbleNike has been hurting the feelings of Chinese people, it seems. The State Administration for Radio, Film and Television (Sarft) has banned an advert for the US sports group because it fails to respect ""the traditional culture of the motherland"".The commercial features basketball star LeBron James battling all comers in a simulated computer game. Among his opponents are a couple of Chinese women.But Sarft's complaint that Nike has ""insulted national customs"" suggests its ire may be directed at least as much at James' other opponents: a kung-fu master and a dragon.Worst of all, no doubt, Nike's corporate champion win the bouts.On messageWhat do you get if you combine ""Chinese Wisdom and International Expertise""? If state-owned China Aviation Oil is any guide, $550m in losses.The fine-sounding East-West slogan coined by CAO did not stop the company from being mired in a scandal over its oil derivative trading debacle. But Singapore-listed CAO is keeping the slogan on its website, along with a number of reminders that corporate introductions on the internet must be treated with caution.After all, CAO's claim that it was ""maximising profits"" by combining derivative and physical trading looks a little out of date.So does its boast of ""overwhelming support from international bankers"" - since they were last seen heading for the hills.No doubt CAO's government owners will be hoping that its ambition to be a ""bellwether firm for overseas Chinese enterprises"" will prove to be equally incorrect.Big wheelsIt comes as no surprise that Americans like to drive big cars, but the US Census Bureau, usually in the business of tracking people, has released some data saying they don't like them at the same rate as they used to.Although SUV registrations increased by 56 per cent from 1997 to 2002, that paled in comparison with the golden years of 1992 to 1997 when they shot up 81 per cent.Still, the statistics say that one of every eight drivers in the US has an SUV, while in Colorado and Wyoming a whopping one out of five drives the snow-stomping machines.

This UK market is forecast to be worth £9m in 2005; internationally, it is valued at more than $1bn a year, according to Forrester, the research company.Among the brands which have already appeared in games are Nike, Pepsi, Toyota, Tesco Personal Finance, GSK, MTV and Thomas Cook. The branding can take the form of product placement within games, or content such as images of posters or, in football games, pitch advertising.Malcolm Russell, business director at WPP media buying agency Mindshare, says games publishers and advertisers are starting to embrace games as a medium.Mindshare’s own research confirms that consumers born in the 1990s are watching 25 per cent less TV than those born in the 1960s and 1970s. “This group is spending more time playing games which really involve them and this is providing some exciting opportunities for advertisers compared to TV which is relatively passive,” says Russell.But the games market is very fragmented, and advertisers have found it difficult to discover which titles are being developed, when they are due for release and who they are targeted at. In response, Cocojambo will launch the first quarterly online and print guide next week where global games publishers can advertise details of their games, including the territories they will be released in and the target audience, to help brands match up with particular releases.With marketers looking at the mix of budget allocations for 2005, Michael Wood, director of Cocojambo, says he has been answering queries from advertisers interested in getting involved in games.”For media buyers and advertisers over 35, games have been a novelty. But for teenagers and consumers in their early 20s, Halo 2 is part of the media landscape as much as Wife Swap,” says Wood.Matt Davies, business development manager of Codemasters games publisher, says an industry-wide guide is needed to assist advertisers. “In-game advertising is growing in importance as brands seek to target consumers in more innovative ways. We have to be focused on helping advertisers to have a better understanding of the games market,” he says.The company has persuaded brands such as Certina Watches, Sharp and Ford to buy brand content in Colin McRae Rally.steve.hemsley@talk21.comwww.cocojambo.com"

805;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-11-19T18:03:57Z;Advantage Agassi in UK tax dispute;;"André Agassi, the US tennis star, on Friday scored a legal victory for international sports stars and entertainers which lawyers say could cost the UK tax authorities up to £500m.The Court of Appeal in London ruled in favour of the 34-year-old superstar in a dispute over tax charged on earnings from product endorsement deals while he was in Britain for short periods - for example, to play at Wimbledon.At the heart of Mr Agassi's legal challenge were payments from Nike, the sportswear manufacturer, and Head Sports, the Austrian tennis racquet-maker. These were made to the player's US-based company, Agassi Enterprises.Although the sums at stake in Mr Agassi's case are relatively modest - a tax bill of £27,500 - the result could have much wider - and lucrative - implications for other international sports and showbiz stars.Mr Agassi's legal team estimated the costs to the Inland Revenue at up to £500m, if international celebrities who had toured or made short-term visits to the UK since a 1988 tax act came into force, attempted to claim tax back from the British tax authorities.But laywers for the tax authority told the court there would be an ongoing cost to the government's coffers running to tens of millions of pounds.Inland Revenue itself declined to comment further, except to say that it would attempt to get the House of Lords- the UK’s highest court - to hear a further appeal. But tax specialists who were not involved in the case agreed that the decision raised the possibility of substantial repayment claims and could also encourage international stars to restructure their endorsement deals in the future.""Up to the Agassi case, quite a few people had bitten the bullet,"" said Barry Murphy, tax specialist with PwC in London. Anyone coming to the UK in the future ""may well revisit existing structures and make appropriate amendments,"" he added.The Inland Revenue had claimed that, under the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act, Mr Agassi should pay tax on endorsement earnings which occurred while he was visiting the UK, and sent him a bill for the 1998-9 tax year.Lawyers and accountants for the tennis star retorted that he had no tax presence in Britain.Earlier this year, a lower court judge found in the taxman's favour, saying it was absurd to think that lawmakers had intended that UK tax liability could be avoided ""by the simple expedient of channeling the payment through a foreign company with no tax presence here"".But the Court of Appeal judges overruled this. Lord Justice Buxton said that the judge's original decision appeared to have based on an acceptance of the Revenue's claim that parliament had meant to extend the charge for tax when it brought in provisions to cover entertainers and sportsmen for the first time in the late-1980s.But, he continued. ""It is difficult to say that extension of the charge was the clear objective of the..scheme"" or, at least, ""sufficiently clearly so"" to override the normal territoriality principles.Lord Justice Buxton acknowledged that if parliament reviewed the issue, it might choose to extend the scope of the rules. But as the Act stood, he said the situation was not ""either absurd or an invitation to tax evasion"", and did not ""come anywhere near to being a case in which the territoriality principle does not prevail"".The other two judges agreed.Afterwards, Mr Agassi's business managers said that they were ""thrilled“ with the ruling. ""We felt that position taken by Andre's UK accountants was correct all along,"" they commented."

Mr Perez, who has run 11 marathons, joins Nike from SC Johnson & Son, a consumer chemical products company, where he has been president and chief executive since 1996.During his 34-year career with SC Johnson, whose brands include Drano, Windex and Ziploc, Mr Perez managed country, regional and worldwide operations and multiple brands. He has also been a director at Kellogg Company since 1999, and serves on the audit committee and the consumer marketing committee.“I was drawn to this company because the Nike brand perpetually stays current, making it one of the best managed on the globe,” Mr Perez said.Nike said it began the search for Mr Knight's successor in early 2003.“This begins an exciting new chapter in Nike's ongoing business evolution,” said Mr Knight. “Bill is a highly regarded and deeply talented leader with more than 30 years experience as a builder of global brands and businesses.”He added: “He also knows how to operate a highly socially responsible global business, all of which make him the right person to lead Nike.”Over the years Nike has been criticised for allegedly producing its goods in sweatshops in Asia. In the mid-1990s Nike began to fight back with a public relations blitz that included news releases, advertisements and letters to newspapers. It also agreed to an open monitoring of Nike factories by the Fair Labor Association.Mr Knight, 66, co-founded Nike in 1972 with Bill Bowerman, track coach at the University of Oregon. Since its fledgling beginnings when Mr Knight sold track shoes from the boot of his car, Nike has grown to a company with $12.3bn in revenues and $945.6m in profits in fiscal 2004.In September Nike reported a better than expected 25 per cent jump in first-quarter profits, helped by robust US sales.Mr Knight said that in the near term, he would focus his efforts on ensuring an effective transition and on evolving into his role as an active chairman.“I also plan to maintain my status as the world's number one sports fan,” he said.Nike's shares closed down 1.15 per cent at $85 in New York.
807;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-10-29T20:11:03Z;On Wall Street: A not so white shoe deal;;"White shoe. Full Price. Quiet Period.These phrases would find a happier home in Ambrose Bierce's ""Devil's Dictionary"" than the Oxford English dictionary, but say much about Wall Street.First, let's address white shoe, as in: ""Morgan Stanley is a white shoe investment bank.""That sentence will pop up from time to time in a profile of Morgan Stanley, but it should be in past tense. For those readers who did not attend an Ivy League university, whose graduates in the first third of the last century apparently had horrible taste in footwear, our phrase is supposed to call to mind the buckskin shoes once worn by conservative young men at schools including Princeton and Harvard and thus their savoir fare.When the shoes were popular, the phrase was probably apt, but since the 1970s, Morgan Stanley has been – to paraphrase Ron Chernow from his National Book Award winning history ""The House of Morgan"" – experimenting with a more muscular approach to business than the tweedy-well bred style of banking for which the House of Morgan was known.This week it got positively burly. It agreed to join UBS, Donald Trump's oft-used banker, in arranging a $500m loan to Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which just agreed to go bankrupt sometime next month.Watch the hit TV-show ""The Apprentice"". Mr Trump is not a white-shoe kind of guy. He's more of a black hand-sewn loafer under a Brioni suit kind of guy. And the loan Morgan Stanley is helping to arrange isn't going towards the kind of place where patrons would wear white-shoes, unless they had a Nike swoosh on them or were made of patent leather and had six-inch heels: the $500m will help pay for renovations to The Donald's Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City.You could comfortably bet that someone at Morgan Stanley wishes that loan wasn't being arranged. Not for financial reasons necessarily but because they want Morgan Stanley staff to be seen as white-shoe kind of people who are above dealing with the Donald Trumps of the world. But that isn't the firm and hasn't been for a long time. Morgan Stanley's shoes are black and it likes its profit column to be that colour too.Next let's address full price, as in: ""Bank of America paid a full price for FleetBoston Financial.""This week marked the anniversary of BofA's $47bn offer for FleetBoston. At the time, several critics of the transaction said the price, which represented a 42 per cent premium, was expensive. But some investors did not want to be proven wrong, so they said only time would tell if Ken Lewis, BofA chief executive, paid a high price or a full price.Here's the difference: success or failure. Had the FleetBoston transaction crushed earnings or led to other troubles, the price would be remembered as high. But so far investors are calling it full.And BofA was happy this week to share why through a fact sheet that said: BofA shares measured from the close on October 24, 2003, the trading day before the merger announcement, to October 22, 2004 have outperformed the S&P 500, and peers including Citigroup, Wachovia and Wells Fargo; BofA's valuation as measured by price-to-earnings has declined less than the market and every peer except for JP Morgan Chase; In the former FleetBoston franchise, BofA opened 129,000 net new checking accounts in the six months since the merger closed on April 1 or more than FleetBoston opened all last year; and while ""Investors scoffed at Ken Lewis' assertions that he saw improvement in Fleet's performance that was not reflected in the market price"" Fleet's earnings per share trend had a better growth rate than BofA's from the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2004.Now for quiet period, as in: ""This week the US Securities and Exchange Commission proposed getting rid of the quiet period rule.”This Depression-era regulation was designed to prevent companies poised to sell stock or bonds to the public from promoting the securities beyond what was written in a prospectus.But in an age of electronic communication the SEC commissioners figure it is silly that companies cannot answer questions asked by investors or the media about a prospectus written in legalese.Which is great, because now we might be able to question whether a white-shoe firm is helping a company sell stock at a full price.david.wells@ft.com"
808;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-10-19T06:01:55Z;Sneaker preview;;It’s January 2008. Roger Clapp, UK brand manager of Zorro, the Nike sub-brand for the Saga generation, is trying to devise a summer television advertising campaign.For years, brands targeted 16-24-year-old males. Then they realised that the real money was in the 45-60-year-olds. Zorro’s sleek design has made it a cool and edgy brand, but its added cushion, which supports the leg joints and diminishes the impact on the ankles, knees and hips, has won over older consumers.But effective television campaigns are much harder to come by in 2008. Twenty per cent of UK households have personal video recorders (PVRs). The total number of commercial impacts delivered by television has declined by 6 per cent from 2004, as viewers watch more recorded television and skip through the ads. And viewers often find overt product placement deals intrusive.FT Creative Business downloaded Clapp’s diary to see what solutions he explores.9am: Meet Jeremy Bleak and the rest of our finance team. We all agree that sporting events along with reality television are among the few programme categories which pull in live TV viewing. Chat about sponsoring the Beijing Olympics and Euro 2008, but Bleak doesn’t think the return on investment will justify the outlay.Have to concede that rights owners are demanding high fees for official sponsorship, these days. May need to talk to guerrilla agency Stark Naked.10am: Discuss reality TV sponsorship opportunities with the production company formerly known as Endemol, now part of ad giant WPP. It pitches a couple of new formats. The first is reality ads. For 30 minutes, celebrities wearing sponsored kit are placed in a high-pressure situation and viewers given a taster ad of 30 seconds. Those who want to carry on watching press the red button, while the TV goes on to live pause. Viewers who want to download the ad on to the PVR’s hard drive press the green button and they can watch the ad later. Those who don’t care can carry on watching the programme.There has already been one reality ad for Unilever’s Cream Tarts. It starred ex-footballer David Beckham, his former wife Victoria, and Rebecca Loos. The three, wearing Cream Tarts t-shirts sit in a room with a pile of Cream Tarts on a table as the tension mounts. There is a row and a pie slinging match, which ends with Beckham trying to break up Victoria and Rebecca.The second pitch is for a new reality show, The Home. Contestants compete to win a place in a luxury retirement community in Arizona. Considering Zorro’s target audience, it could be perfect sponsorship material. Price seems very high. Sponsorship prices have doubled since 2004 according to Starcom, the media agency, and three weeks is a long commitment.12.30pm: Call ITV sales supremo, Mark Merrydown. Try to leave a message but his voice-mail is full.1pm: To the gym, where Richard Desmond is with his personal trainer. Try and avoid him as he has been offering product-placement opportunities on his adult channels.3:30pm: Try to talk to Merrydown again. His PA says he’s still at lunch. Force her to leave another Post-it on his PC.4pm: Another call to ITV. Merrydown’s PA says I’ve just missed him, and he has gone for very early drinks with an agency.Instead, chat to Nigel Walley at consultants Decipher about EPG strategy. With 75 to 80 per cent of households now having digital multichannel television, the EPG has become valuable real estate for marketers and a huge source of revenue for the platform owners. Consumers don’t mind a logo on their EPG, Nigel says. Complain to Walley that Merrydown is not returning calls. Doesn’t he want my money?Nigel laughs and shows me a chart. ITV’s overall impacts are down, but its share of commercial impacts has risen. Viewers have tended not to skip creative ads, and the decline in commercial impacts on terrestrial channels, where the quality of the advertising has risen, has been modest compared with that on multichannel TV.The PVR has hit smaller multichannel broadcasters which depend on repeat programmes and ads with poor creative. ITV’s impacts are down 4 per cent, Channel 4 and Five’s are down 7.5 per cent while the multichannels have declined 18 per cent. Could explain why ITV is back to treating advertisers like rubbish.7pm: Go home to try and catch Corrie. Tonight sees the latest in its interactive storylines where viewers decide between three potential outcomes. This has boosted viewing. Will Deirdre and Ken remarry after surviving a month-long quarantine in the Rovers Return following the discovery of a suspect package in one of Betty’s hot pots? This is going to be one of the TV year’s highlights, though the prices demanded for the programme’s sponsorship have fuelled rumours that Cadbury’s is reviewing its current deal. Can we can slip in there for a joint sponsorship. Sugary snacks and exercise might make a good fit.emiko.terazono@ft.comBased on research: “Starcom Engagement Panel” by Starcom and “PVRs - Should TV Companies Care?” by Decipher
809;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-10-14T17:23:44Z;Market Insight: Act of salvation for dollar?;;A toxic cocktail of widening US trade and budget deficits, slowing growth and rampant oil prices has left the foreign exchange market few reasons to be upbeat about the prospects for the dollar.But there has been a wave of excitement this week as the US Senate approved the Homeland Investment Act, with just the signature of George W. Bush now needed to sign the act into law.Dollar bulls see US multinationals converting up to $120bn of foreign-held assets into dollars as a result of the legislation, potentially strengthening the greenback by as much as 5 per cent. In contrast, dollar bears believe the effect will be negligible.The act is part of a package of corporate tax breaks designed to replace US export subsidies declared illegal by the World Trade Organisation.The Homeland Act itself provides a one-year window in which US corporations can repatriate retained overseas profits at a tax rate of 5.25 per cent, as opposed to the normal 35 per cent.Johnson & Johnson, the consumer and medical products group, this week said it would repatriate $7bn-$10bn under the act. More announcements are likely, given that the legislation was sponsored by 13 trade associations and 57 corporations, including the likes of Apple, Dell, Intel, Nike and Schering-Plough.Analysts have been busy drawing up their estimates of the eventual inflows. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York, sees US corporates holding $150bn-$350bn in retained earnings overseas, with around $120bn of that held in foreign currency. “Well over $100bn will flow through the FX market, with sterling and the euro the most likely to be negatively impacted,” he says.While this figure pales against the US current account of about $600bn a year, it is not far from the country's peak net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow of $160bn, in 2000.Adrian Schmidt, senior FX strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland, sees a maximum inflow of $100bn, based on $400bn-$600bn being held overseas by US corporates, with 80 per cent of that already in dollars.He argues that US companies will already have repatriated the bulk of their earnings from countries with relatively high rates of corporate tax, such as Japan and Canada. The largest outflows, therefore, may come from the euro, the Singapore dollar and the Swiss franc. “Switzerland has a tax rate 10 percentage points lower than in the US. The Swiss franc stands out as having the potential to see a greater-than-average repatriation flow.”Mr Schmidt sees a $50bn outflow from the euro, almost enough to cancel out the eurozone's $60bn trade surplus with the US. “The act could, at a stroke, nearly remove the bilateral trade demand for euros,” he says.Tony Norfield, global head of FX strategy at ABN Amro, plumps for $75bn-100bn, enough to strengthen the dollar by 3 per cent in trade-weighted terms in 2005, all else being equal.But some are less bullish. Michael Metcalfe, currencies strategist at State Street Bank, sees flows of $6bn a month but argues this would be a “small stop-gap in financing concerns and a temporary one at that”. UBS estimates $50bn-100bn but sees “negligible” benefit for the dollar. Ditto Marc Chandler, a hedge fund adviser whose discussions with some of the US corporates with the largest retained overseas earnings lead him to conclude that the bulk is already held in dollar assets, with smaller amounts in low tax states such as Switzerland and Luxembourg.Divyang Shah, global strategist at IdeaGlobal, offers another thought: if the act does help strengthen the dollar, this may merely lessen the need for Asian central banks to support the greenback, leaving the dollar back where it started.
810;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Miramax unveils Wild Brain deal;;Miramax, the art house film subsidiary of Walt Disney, has announced plans to move into computer-generated animation in a far-reaching alliance with Wild Brain, the US rival to studios such as Pixar and DreamWorks.The companies are to jointly finance animated family films, which will be distributed by Miramax and its Dimension sister company over the next five years.The films will be the first feature-length production from Wild Brain, better known for its animated commercials for companies such as Ford Motor Company and Nike, as well as television series and short films including ?Hubert's Brain?.The deal is not related to on-going negotiations between Miramax and Walt Disney over a new contract to replace the current deal for Bob and Harvey Weinstein, co-founders of Miramax, which expires next September.Disney, nevertheless, is committed to increasing its own computer-generated animation production pending the potential end of its 10-year relationship with Pixar, the animation business led by Steve Jobs, head of the Apple technology group.Financial terms of the Miramax-Wild Brain tie-up have not been disclosed.Wild Brain, however, said it had secured funding from Syntek Capital, the private equity group, to expand into feature films in co-operation with Miramax and Dimension.The company has also appointed Jim Miller, former president of the Warner studios theatrical business, as its new chairman.Sam Humphreys, chief executive of Syntek Capital, said: ?We believe this combination will be one of the most exciting ventures in the entertainment industry during the next several years.?Bob Weinstein, chairman of Dimension Films, said the tie-up would exploit rising demand for animated family films.Up to five films will be produced by the alliance.
811;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-09-20T20:42:12Z;Wall St starts week lower as crude rises;;"A renewed rise in oil prices weighed on Wall Street blue chips on Monday alongside a warning from Colgate-Palmolive, although semiconductor shares moved higher despite another warning about slow demand in the sector.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 10,204.89 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 0.6 per cent to 1,122.20. The Nasdaq Composite gave up all of its earlier gains and was off 0.1 per cent to 1,908.07.Reports that Russian oil producer Yukos had ceased some of its exports to China sent Nymex crude futures above $46 per barrel, rekindling fears about corporate profitability in the face of rising fuel costs.On the corporate front, shares in Colgate-Palmolive gave up 11.2 per cent to $48.23 after the consumer goods group warned that second-half earnings would miss estimates owing to higher costs for marketing.Procter and Gamble, which reiterated its earnings guidance two weeks ago, saw its shares lose 3.3 per cent to $54.38. P&G and Colgate paced a 15 per cent decline in the household products index of the S&P 500.Colgate's news added to the impact of a similar warning fromUnilever, which cut its annual profit growth estimate by more than half. Unilever's US-listed stock lost 4.6 per cent to $58.16.Elsewhere among consumer stocks, Kraft Foods eased 0.4 per cent to $32.40.The prospect of high marketing costs and rising fuel costs deepens concern about the profitability of consumer companies at a time when consumer demand appears to be softening. Last week Coca-Cola warned of lower earnings amid declining demand for its soft drinks in key markets.A bright spot came from Nike, which said demand for its sports footwear and clothing was strong and helped it beat analyst estimates as earnings grew 23 per cent in the quarter. Shares added 1.9 per cent to $78.Semiconductor stocks rose once again, defying a downgrade of earnings forecasts by PMC-Sierra. Shares in the telecoms chipmaker rose 4.1 per cent to $9.86.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was up 2.9 per cent, paced by a 4.5 per cent rise to $27.04 in Novellus Systems, which announced it had expanded its share buyback plan. Some analysts have warned of lower spending on technology in the upcoming year as an increasing number of companies said high inventories would slow their sales.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at Cybertrader, said technology stocks were ""trying to catch up with and participate in the overall market rally that began in early August"". He noted that weakness in technology shares and low trading volumes had been a dent in the credibility of the rally.""Techs are laggards; our thinking is that as the rally broadens and expands, technology will start to outperform,"" Mr Tower said.However, sobering comment on technology stocks arrive from Tobias Levkovich at Smith Barney, who said: ""[Tech] investors have seemingly ignored recent earnings-driven data points of late, [but] we do not such disregard is sustainable.Concluding his research, Mr Levkovich described himself as ""deeply worried about equity markets through year-end 2004"".In the financial sector, Citigroup shares lost 3.3 per cent to $45.40 and leading the delines of its industry sub-index of the S&P 500, itself among the wqorst performing sectors of the benchmark yesterday. Guy Moszkowski at Merrill Lynch cut his rating for the world's largest financial services company from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" after Japanese regulators ordered the group to close its private banking unit in Japan.The ruling came after ""other examples of aggressive profit incentives overriding judgment"", Mr Moszkowski said. While direct impact on earnings is small, he warned: ""Inculcating the necessary levels of ethical judgment across [Citi's] businesses and down the chain of command …will take more time and effort than we had expected.""Elsewhere among financials, Goldman Sachs stock eased 0.4 per cent to $91.68.Also lower was Maxim Pharmaceuticals, which said an experimental drug for liver cancer did not show improvements for patients. The news sent shares 48.8 per cent lower to $3.06."
812;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-09-01T17:31:46Z;The changing face of Mexican promotion;;New role models and evolving consumer markets are challenging the dominant notion that fair skin sells, writes Sara SilverMexicans have a new hero, according to Nike: an Olympic runner so fast that little boys flex their biceps in admiration. “Now, my hero is a gal,” says the boy on billboards across the nation. “Thanks, Ana!”But if he watched televised coverage of Ana Guevara on her way to the silver medal in the 400 metres in Athens, he would have seen few Mexicans as dark as Guevara in the commercials that ran either side of her races, apart from those starring the sprinter herself.Instead, Mexicans glued to their sets saw a man who could have been Swedish pitching high-speed internet access or European-looking students promoting the open admissions at a private high school. In another advertisement, a cable television client gets fish-eyed incompetence from a dark-skinned - or moreno - representative but finds problems solved by the white - güero - salesman for satellite TV.These Mexican commercials followed the dictates of aspirational advertising, which tries to associate products with the lifestyles of the wealthy and powerful - in other words, güeros. Only occasionally are viewers asked to identify with a fellow moreno - for example, in a commercial for an appliance chain's low-end bank, one man boasts to his two fairer buddies about the high interest he gets paid.Such advertising rarely pictures the intended consumer but rather the upscale lifestyle the consumer is supposed to emulate. In a Latino nation where most consumers are dark-skinned, such as Mexico, the tendency to feature güeros in advertising might be considered racist or at least distasteful. But it is pervasive.“Even Mexico's biggest chicken company uses white hens in their billboards,” notes advertising analyst Enriqueta Rivera, who teaches at the Monterrey Tech university.By contrast, advertising aimed at the $450bn Hispanic market in the US uses Latin faces and often Mexican themes, since two-thirds of the target group are of Mexican descent. At $3bn per year, the budget for advertising to 35m US Hispanics is greater than the $2.5bn spent on 100m Mexicans, notes Enrique Gibert, founder of the Mexican advertising agency Gibert Quattro.Yet, the persistence of fair skin in Mexican ads seems to miss a dramatic change in the Mexican consumer. Over the past five years, cheap credit from vehicle companies, department stores and credit card companies has put their products suddenly within the reach of the working classes.Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant, estimates that the Mexican market for cars and appliances is 30m, while the market for cell phones could be as high as 70m. He dates the change to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, which lowered tariffs and prices for US goods and encouraged manufacturers to overproduce. Companies started to issue credit, while Wal-Mart brought rigorous pricing policies, enabling it to sell to more Mexicans. “Foreign companies came to sell to all Mexicans, not just the top 10m, and that is a reality that has influenced Mexican companies.”Tawny-skinned and mahogany-eyed, Mr Ramirez de la O moves in elite circles. He says he is not offended by the association of white skin with success but does find it ridiculous.Brazil, the other economic giant of the region, has developed a distinctive advertising style, but admiration of American lifestyles has kept the Mexican industry from doing the same - alongside the fear that morenos will not buy products that ads portray as being associated with morenos, because they will seem downscale.Mexicans' conflicted sense of self-worth, according to several advertising executives, can be said to go back to La Malinche, the native Mexican translator of the conquistador Hernán Cortés. For Mexicans, La Malinche - who bore Cortés's child - embodies mixing, or mestizaje, and betrayal.There are also more practical reasons for using fair models. According to José Miguel Jaime, of the Mexican advertising agency Precision Marcom, about one-quarter of commercials seen in Mexico are filmed for use throughout Latin America and use neutral images. Another quarter are made for Mexico but filmed abroad to cut costs. For the remainder “you might want different ads to target a higher-end and lower segments but clients don't want to spend on two versions and so you tend to see ads for the elite crowd”. The choice of light-skinned models may be subconscious. “I have never thought that we were seeking models that perpetuate certain stereotypes,” says Carlos Lopez, vice-president of client relations at Publicis Arredondo de Haro, an affiliate of the Publicis Groupe. “No one asks for light skin - they use words like attractive, pretty, well-dressed, well-presented”.But many creative directors admit they ignore the 50m Mexicans who live in poverty, even though their collective purchasing power has helped to create fortunes for the makers of Coca-Cola and disposable diapers.“What we look for is that people identify with and believe in the brand,” says Maria Gloria Loaiza, Pampers account manager at Starcom Media Vest Group Mexico, which uses ads made in Venezuela for distribution throughout Latin America. “When the ad is not credible, neither is the product. Our babies have to be in the real world: they look Latino.”Change is in sight in certain areas. Children of various skin tones regularly appear in promotions. Dark hair seems to be overtaking blonde in commercials. And ads made for the 20m Mexicans living abroad, who have more of a sense of pride in their identity, tend to feature average citizens.S2, a new Mexico City advertising agency, depicts real Mexicans enjoying everyday life. “Obviously, the product needs to be something that people aspire to but the lie is that the aspiration lies in the image,” says Eduardo “Spooky” Pérez, the agency's founder. “Today's aspirations have to do with a more humane lifestyle, with ‘being' instead of ‘what you should be', with values common to the rich and the poor”. He blames the gap between Ana Guevara and the ads surrounding her Olympic performance on irresponsible publicists: “They don't realise that they would sell so much more if they chose real Mexicans,” says Mr Pérez. “If they identify with your message, at least they'll try your product.”As production costs decline within Mexico, it will become easier for agencies to make local advertisements. The question is whether they will.“To appeal to the Aztecs, Spanish missionaries changed the skin colour of the Virgin,” notes Ms Rivera. “Five hundred years later, advertising agencies are afraid to take a risk and do the same.”HOW ASPIRATIONS OF THE 1950s BECAME EMBEDDED IN THE CULTUREFair faces are unusual in Mexico, a mestizo, or racially mixed, nation where Spanish conquistadors and other European immigrants mixed with the indigenous population and African slaves. Catholic missionaries in the 16th century produced a dark-skinned role model in the Virgin of Guadalupe, now the nation's patron saint. And, although the European-descended elite still populate the top echelons of business and government, mestizos form the bulk of executives in both the public and private sector.Genetic mixes ensure varying skin tones even within families, says Dan Lund of the Mexico City polling and research firm Mund Americas. There is discrimination based on skin colour, but social class is more important. “Dark Mexicans do get to have what rich people have, but it's confirmed to you through advertising that something is worth aspiring to if it's held up by a white person.”Analysts trace that link to the 1950s, when transnational companies and advertising agencies promoted the US lifestyle through local TV. “It was a vision of ‘I Love Lucy', with the car parked at the door, the kitchen full of gleaming appliances”, says Carlota Garcia, an advertising expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “This coincided with the growth of the Mexican middle class, whose sights were set on the US, and the model hasn't changed.”
813;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-08-18T21:01:31Z;Nike scores on the soccer pitch;;Walking round Nike's European headquarters outside Amsterdam, everyone, it seems, is ready to play sport. Nike-clad employees mill about on their way to the many sports facilities on the site, which, like the US group's main base in Oregon, looks more like a university campus than a corporate headquarters. Eunan McLaughlin, the 46-year-old head of Nike's European business, likes taking part in sport. To prove it, he owns more than 350 pairs of trainers. But when it comes to business, just taking part is not enough. It is the winning that counts.The Olympic Games in Athens are offering ample opportunities for Nike to promote its products. But Mr McLaughlin's attention is also focused on the soccer season, just started in England and Germany.New figures show that Nike has for the first time overtaken Adidas as the leading soccer brand in Europe. NPD, a market research firm, tracks consumer “value sales” in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. It calculates that Nike had 34 per cent of the soccer footwear market in the 12 months to March, with Adidas responsible for 30.2 per cent.It is a significant turnround for Nike, which is best known for its basketball and athletics sports gear.“The feeling after the US World Cup in 1994 was that we really needed to get into football because people didn't take us seriouslyas a football brand,” says Mr McLaughlin. “I think that at that time we were ranked seventh internationally. Then, from 1994 to 2002, we went from seventh place to second.”He declines to give an exact figure for the size of the group's soccer business. But two years ago Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimated that the division was worth about $500m in sales. “We've doubled [soccer sales] since 2002,” he says.The increase has been driven by new products, such as the Mercurial Vapor, the lightest boot on the market, weighing just 196g, and the Total 90, worn by Nike-endorsed stars such as Wayne Rooney, the hottest property in English soccer.Nike's endorsement strategy is a key feature of its effort to maintain its credibility among its customers. If its products are worn - and used - by some of the biggest names in sport, then it can hope to be what Mr McLaughlin calls “an authentic brand”. If that happens, he explains, “the rest will come”.Nike has signed up some major international soccer stars and teams, who have helped the growth of its football business. It does not have David Beckham, the English star at Real Madrid, who has a deal with Adidas. But it has contracts with England's two most successful soccer clubs: a long-term kit deal with Arsenal and a £300m ($548m) multi-year deal with Manchester United. It also made kit for the Portugal soccer team that reached the final of Euro 2004. Aside from Rooney, it has deals with Thierry Henry, the French star, and Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker.“We go after teams and individuals that play attractive football,” says Mr McLaughlin. “We don't just want to be sticking the [Nike] swoosh on anybody and everybody. It's about bringing some excitement and innovation to it.“There are now more boots being worn in the [English] Premier League by Nike players than any other brand,” he adds. “Almost half the goals scored at the European Championships - 38 out of 77, I think - were scored in Nike boots. The testimony to the product quality and innovation is there from the players and from the athletes.”Not every Nike-sponsored player can turn in a successful performance, however. Henry was expected to star at Euro 2004 but, together with his French team mates, was knocked out of the competition at an early stage. Similarly, LeBron James, the teenage basketball sensation whom Nike signed last year on a seven-year deal worth a reported $90m, could not save the US Olympic basketball team from a humiliating defeat this week to Puerto Rico.But defeats happen in sport and, like its rivals, Nike is not immune to any dips in the form of the stars it sponsors. Great things are still expected of James in basketball as they are of Rooney in soccer. “I think the Rooney signing will be huge,” says Mr McLaughlin. “The main thing is to make sure that he stays on the rails . . . We have to make sure he doesn't end up being commercialised too soon and too quickly.”Like many of Nike's customers, Rooney is young. And with brands fromall sorts of industries targeting young consumers,Mr McLaughlin says Nike has to remember that it is also competing against companies from outside the sports world.“Growing up as a kid, all I did was play football,” he says. “You made the goal posts, you kicked a ball around - that was the way we grew up.“But today, kids are on PlayStation . . . so I think part of our challenge is to keep football exciting for kids, to keep them inspired and interested in it. In the past, people thought of us competing only against Adidas or Puma, but in reality we are also competing against electronic games or mobile phones, which is where kids are spending their money.”Nike is not only besotted with soccer. The Olympics are providing it with the chance to parade new products. Some of these may never make it into shops. As Mr McLaughlin says, the Olympics are like haute couture in the fashion industry, giving an indication of what Nike's customers will be buying tomorrow.“It's like the Milan catwalk. We don't sell many Cathy Freeman speed suits to the general public, but it shows people what we are doing with the brand, what we are doing with technology. We take that technology [see below] and we cascade it down to street-wear.”But the Olympic Games present considerable challenges to marketers. Talk of drugs scandals is loud, and companies whose endorsed athletes are caught cheating could suffer some nasty commercial repercussions. Marion Jones, the US track star - and Nike-sponsored athlete - has become embroiled in controversy, having been interviewed twice by the US Anti-Doping Agency as part of its investigation into Balco, the nutritional supplements company alleged to have supplied drugs to a number of top athletes.Mr McLaughlin says Nike's policy regarding doping is clear. “We would never condone the use of any kind of illegal substances or banned substances - or anything of that nature, ever. The second thing is that we always support our athletes until proven guilty.“We've worked with Marion Jones for years, she's been a huge inspiration on some of our products and we're delighted to continue working with her. She has come out with a number of statements on [the allegations] and until there's any evidence or anything to the contrary we will continue to support her.”Mr McLaughlin expresses confidence that the Olympics will be a success: “It will be huge for us.” The secret of further growth, he says, is to imagine that Nike is taking part in a competitive sport. “In basketball, no coach has ever said ‘get out and score 84 points' - they say ‘get out there and win'. If the other side has scored 90, then we need to score 92. So our belief is that, in every aspect of your business, you've always got to win.”It might, as Pierre de Coubertin, the French aristocrat who organised the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, put it, be the taking part, rather than the winning, that is important - but not for Nike.THE RACE TO BE FIRST TO GIVE ATHLETES WHAT THEY NEED TO WINNike is working with Paula Radcliffe, the marathon world record holder and Great Britain's long-distance running Olympic medal prospect. It has designed a so-called “cooling jacket” to be worn before she races. The company claims that, by reducing a runner's core body temperature before competing, it can enhance performance.The hope is that the jacket will be as memorable as the green and white all-in-one speed suit that Nike designed for Cathy Freeman, the star sprinter who won the 400m gold medal at the Sydney Olympics four years ago.The picture of the Australian athlete slumped on the floor, the hood of her suit pulled off as she took in the magnitude of her achievement, became one of the enduring images of the Games.Nike launches new products designed for particular athletes at every Olympics. If the athlete wins, Nike can hit the commercial jackpot because the resulting international exposure links the company with genuine sporting success.In 1996 Michael Johnson smashed the 400m world record and he also won a gold medal in the 200m, wearing a pair of gold Nike spiked running shoes. Nike made them for Johnson after he requested a pair of shoes that were lighter than the gold chain he wore round his neck.As well as Radcliffe's cooling jacket, Nike has developed a new track shoe - branded the “Monsterfly” - that appears to have a spring attached to the heel. It is designed to help sprinters power out of the starting blocks.The Nike marketing blurb says that the “unique” shape of the shoe helps the “sprinter to keep the foot in a proper position, stabilising the heel for optimal traction”.Cynics would say such products are gimmicks. That may be true but, as athletes strive to improve their performance, they are likely to try anything that they think will help them win - providing it is within the rules.And if they win, Nike wins too.
814;NKE;Nike Inc;2004-08-17T16:00:38Z;Golf copycats land in the rough;;Ask any Shanghai taxi driver about the best golf equipment deals in town and he will almost certainly drop you off at a bustling retail complex known as Shanghai Mart.Yet after making your way up to the top floor, where there are golf stores galore, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise, because the “best bargains” - the “perfect imitations” and cheap knock-offs - may no longer be available.It reflects the heavy hand of the law that finally came down on this notorious tourist attraction, following a high-profile raid on 11 shops in May, which resulted in the seizure of fake products worth more than $300,000.The raid, which was led by the Administration for Industry and Commerce, China's trade-mark watchdog, was sparked by complaints from a consortium of six US golf equipment manufacturers, including Callaway Golf, Cleveland Golf, Nike, Ping, TaylorMade-adidas and Acushnet (Titleist).It was an unprecedented co-operation by companies that are fighting each other to the teeth in the global golf equipment market.“Counterfeiters are ‘equal opportunity copycats', from whom no good brand is safe,” insists Stu Herrington, Callaway's head of security and investigations. “That makes counterfeiting an industry problem, not just one company's curse.”The Mart raid, he says, was just the opening salvo in a protracted struggle against China's burgeoning counterfeiting industry.Last month, the consortium took the fight to the Chinese manufacturing heartland by raiding five producers of counterfeit golf clubs and equipment in Jiangmen, in Guangdong province, as well as in Putian and Xiamen, both in Fujian province.“Raiding retail outlets is only a first step, because most shops would simply re-stock and continue with their business,” says Loo Shih Yann, a partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, which is acting on the consortium's behalf. “Finding the foundries, the source, has become the Holy Grail for these golf companies.”The premises raided in June included one polishing factory, two assembly facilities and two foundries. The seized goods, worth more than $1m, included thousands of counterfeit golf clubs, grips, shafts and - most importantly - some 84 sets of moulds for making counterfeit golf clubs.The complexity of the operation reflects the murky mix of legal and illegal golf manufacturing in China. Of the six US golf equipment makers, five have most of their production and suppliers in China, reflecting the fact that golf club production is highly labour intensive.Mr Herrington of Callaway concedes that labour costs have turned out to be a double-edged sword. “Economic conditions in China are such that illegitimate manufacturers can persuade employees of legitimate firms to steal intellectual property in return for what amounts to a multiple of their annual salary.”Xiamen, a coastal city located across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan, is a case in point. With its bustling port and manufacturing sector, the city has become a home for Taiwanese-owned golf equipment makers - both legal and illegal.“Up until 1991-92, some80 per cent of the fake stuff came from Taiwan, with 20 per cent originating from China,” says Mr Herrington. “Nowadays, the proportions are completely reversed.”US golf manufacturers decided to step up their efforts to fight counterfeiting two years ago, when they were faced with a worldwide surge of product complaints under warranty, a marked increase in seizures by US customs authorities and a rise in the number of fake golf sets on internet auction sites.In the first half of this year, mainland China accounted for about 58 per cent of all goods seized by US customs authorities. Last year, US customs seized goods worth $94m, with mainland China accounting for some 66 per cent.If the total value of the products seized represents, say, 1 per cent of the fake products that enter the US market, then the total value of counterfeits that flooded into the US in 2003 was about $10bn, with China accounting for $6bn-$8bn. What is China doing about all this? The answer is as complicated as the situation on the ground, where local politics and business interests clash with central government fiat.In his testimony before the US Senate in April, Daniel C.K. Chow, professor at Ohio State University College of Law, said: “In addition to having local officials that may have a direct or indirect financial interest in counterfeiting and piracy, local enforcement officials, prosecutors and judges may be beholden to the local governments that appointed them and may face pressures to protect the local trade in counterfeit and pirated goods.”Indeed, industry experts believe fines are so low they are simply seen as “another cost of doing business”, while criminal prosecution remains relatively rare.Yet the persistent raids on behalf of overseas producers - supported by a relatively pro-active central government - have not been lost on the army of China-based counterfeiters. They are, according to industry experts, already in the process of hedging their bets.“As China toughens its stance on intellectual property rights violations, counterfeiters are starting to move to places like Vietnam, where the environment is less hostile and labour costs are even cheaper.”While the counterfeiting circus might soon move on to the next location, consumers - both in China and overseas - have yet to make up their mind about the merit of “cheap imitations”.Faced with a squeeze on profit margins in their core markets in the US and Europe, companies such as Callaway are pinning their hopes on the “exceptional brand consciousness” of consumers in China, where golf club memberships have become the latest must-have of the aspiring middle class.Yet, Mr Loo of Baker & McKenzie believes most Chinese golfers have more money than style. “A lot of the people who can afford to pay HK$1,000 [US$128] for a round of golf on an average Chinese course would prefer to go out and buy a fake golf set for HK$1,500, rather than a genuine one for more than HK$10,000.”Some golfers may even be able to lay their hands on perfect copies - part of the illegal excess production, or “overruns”, of official suppliers. But most golfers buying fakes will end up with qualitatively inferior products.“The guy in the shop will tell you that he has friends and family at the original equipment manufacturer, who can get rejects with minor cosmetic defects,” says Mr Loo. “As a customer, you might end up believing that you are getting almost perfect quality for one-tenth of the price.”Given the challenges that they are facing in China, US golf equipment makers could be forgiven for wondering if they are indeed winning the war. As Mr Herrington puts it: “We've had a lot of success in the last six months, but it certainly remains a work in progress.”
815;NKE;Nike Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Way out of advertising ghetto;;Spike Lee likes television commercials. The director of such caustic commentaries on US society as Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X is an ad man himself – the chief executive and majority shareholder of Spike DDB, an advertising agency unit of Omnicom, the world's largest marketing services company.But even Mr Lee has his limits. He cringed when Nike, the sportswear maker, ran television ads this year that featured LeBron James, the US teenage basketball sensation, displaying his ball-handling skills in an African-American church packed with a swaying congregation of basketballluminaries.“That LeBron James ad where he comes in the church where negroes are flying through the air doing somersaults [and] tomahawk dunks – to me that was sacrilegious,” observes Mr Lee, speaking at his company's headquarters in Madison Avenue. “I defy anyone to tell me that they will see a commercial that will take place in a synagogue selling any kind of products, or a Catholic church. That was a complete mockery of African-American faith and the black church.”Mr Lee's observations are particularly noteworthy because, as he puts it, “I'm a Nike person.” He directed and acted in a series of groundbreaking ads with Michael Jordan, the basketball star, that helped establish Nike's Air Jordan trainers as the epitome of street fashion in the 1980s. He is also a fan of Mr James, since his ad agency cast him in one of its advertisements. But Mr Lee is a social critic, too, and his reaction to the Nike church ad provides a glimpse into the sensitivities involved in the growing business of US ethnic marketing. Advertisers have been focusing on African-Americans, Hispanics and other US minority groups because of new data demonstrating their buying power.African-Americans in the US, if considered as a separate country, would rank 11th by gross national product, according to UniWorld, an ad agency associate of WPP, the UK marketing services company. More than a quarter of African-Americans earn more than $50,000 a year.At the same time, advertisers have seen an opportunity to reach a new group of consumers that they call “urban” – people of various races who respond to trends emanating from cities. This audience would include everyone from urban professionals accustomed to living in interracial areas to the legions of white suburbanites who have become devotees of rap music – a group so large that it has invited parody in the form of Ali G, the comic creation of the UK's Sacha Baron Cohen now known to television audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Dana Wade, Spike DDB president, estimates that about three-quarters of its business is “urban”, with the rest focused on African-American consumers.Mr Lee says he formed his agency – which employs about 45 people – in the late 1990s because he grew frustrated directing other people's ideas. He owns a 51 per cent stake, with the rest held by DDB Worldwide, one of Omnicom's ad agency networks. But even with majority control, Mr Lee still faces obstacles in the form of corporate notions of African-Americans.Spike DDB's recent work includes a Pepsi-Cola ad that was based on the opera Carmen - with the singer Beyoncé Knowles in the starring role. But Mr Lee and Ms Wade say many potential clients still want to portray African-Americans – particularly young men - in less flattering ways.Ms Wade says: “There is a certain kind of imagery using young African-American men that Americans at large are willing to accept – and that's gangster, over-the-top imagery.” Mr Lee adds: “I hear from a lot of my actor friends that when they go on an audition, they [white directors] go: ‘Can you be a little blacker? Can you be a little more street?'”The result is that, as Mr Lee and Ms Wade see it, African-Americans still exist in an advertising ghetto. Companies selling cars and clothes, or food and drink, or financial services such as insurance, clearly care about minority audiences. But marketers of luxury goods steer clear.“The more luxury-oriented the brand becomes, the more afraid the marketing organisation is,” Ms Wade says. “We are missing in the luxury areas completely. They want to believe that allAfrican-Americans are poor and that we are all uneducated. Thank God for the census, in some way, because people discovered that there was not only a middle class, but an upper middle class in the African-American community.”Mr Lee says the popularity of African-American culture suggests that African-Americans have a greater appeal than many advertisers assume. In this sense, he leaves the impression that he would like his advertising agency to take on a more universal tone.“We [African-Americans] are the ones generating everything as far as fashion, music, language, whatever, goes – but then we are not thought of as being universal and appealing to everybody. If we didn't appeal to everybody, why wouldAfrican-American culture be siphoned off or appropriated?” he says. “What makes us distinct at Spike DDB is that we think we can market to anybody. We have never, ever, ever, had the mindset as African-Americans that what we do and who we are and what we project is limited and not universal.”But for all his universalist ambitions, Mr Lee remains a defender of the faith in a sense – an African-American keen to protect his culture against those who would exploit it or reduce it to minstrelsy. This is hardly a new threat in US society, but Mr Lee remains a keen preservationist.“African-American culture has always been appropriated. Look at Aunt Jemima. Look at Uncle Ben,” Mr Lee says. “One of the – you might say – hustles is how to be black without being black. A lot of people who mastered that made a whole lot of money. You go down the line: Elvis, Eminem, the Beatles when they started out, the Rolling Stones, AlJolson.”Ms Wade says in some cases the agency has broken off relations with clients that stepped over the line into exploitation. She declines to name the companies, explaining that Spike DDB wants to handle such situations “politely”.“When you know you are getting robbed and you know what they want to do is co-opt African-American culture and turn it into something that they believe is African-American culture, you have to move on,” she says. “The good guys are coming because they want to understand the consumer and they don't want to make mistakes. When they come here, with Spike as our leader, they come with an understanding, for the most part, that whatever we do will be respectful of the consumer. There is stuff we are just not going to do.”Mr Lee waited until the end of the interview to mention that he has a film coming out - She Hate Me - and only then to link its theme to his Spike DDB work. Even in advertising, Mr Lee says his ambition is to teach people how to do the right thing.“A lot of what Dana and I have to do is educate our clients, who just don't know. They have a monolithic view of African-Americans: that we all look alike, talk alike, come from the same social and economic background.“If there's racism in the world, in America, it's going to be in the educational system, it's going to be inmovies, it's going to be in advertising.”
