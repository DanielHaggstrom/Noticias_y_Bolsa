0;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2019-01-30T14:37:04Z;General Dynamics boosted as business jet demand takes flight;;Strong demand for business jets and IT services helped General Dynamics notch another forecast-beating quarter of sales and earnings growth.The aerospace and defence company — best known for its Gulfstream planes — saw its shares jump 3 per cent in pre-market trading as it became the latest to be lifted by the bounceback in the corporate-jet maket.After a tough couple of years for the industry, demand has taken off again thanks to provisions in President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax reform that allow buyers to deduct 100 per cent of a new or used plane’s cost on their returns.“Our Aerospace segment successfully managed through a new model transition while achieving good order intake,” said Phebe N. Novakovic, chairman and chief executive.Revenue in the aerospace division, which makes the business jets, jumped by more than 36 per cent during the fourth quarter to $2.7bn. For the year, sales were up 4 per cent at $8.45bn, making the unit once again the company’s biggest, accounting for over 23 per cent of total group sales.While General Dynamics is best known as the maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and Navy ships, it has also in recent years greatly expanded its information systems and technology business, which provides the US government with cyber security systems.It snapped up IT and cyber security group CSRA for $9.6bn, including debt, last February. Gains from the acquisition helped the division nearly double its sales during the quarter to $2.38bn.Elsewhere, the marine systems division — which does work for the Navy — reported an 11.5 per cent rise in revenues to $2.29bn. The combat systems unit, which builds armoured vehicles and ammunitions for the Army, and the mission systems unit, which makes secure communications networks for the military, were the main outliers, with sales dipping 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively, during the period.Overall, General Dynamics took in $10.37bn in sales for the fourth quarter, a 25.4 per cent jump from the prior-year period and ahead of the $10.35bn analysts had expected.Net income, at $909m, or $3.07 per diluted share, also topped expectations for $888m, or $2.99 a share.Last week, Textron, the company behind Cessna jets and Bell helicopters, cited strengthening demand for business jets for a better than expected quarterly profit.
1;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;General Dynamics’ focus on IT pays off;;General Dynamics’ focus on cyber security and IT services continued to pay off during the first quarterThe aerospace and defence company made a strong start to the year, reporting higher revenues and earnings that topped expectations as it benefited from the push by the US government to upgrade its military hardware and modernise its IT platforms.For the three months to April 1, sales rose 1.3 per cent to $7.5bn, in line with estimates.While General Dynamics is best known as the maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and Navy ships, its biggest unit by revenue is its information systems and technology business, which provides the US government with cyber security systems.The division took in $2.23bn in sales during the quarter, a 4.2 per cent rise from the prior period. Underscoring the importance of the business to General Dynamics, the Virginia-based group snapped up IT and cyber security group CSRA for $9.6bn, including debt, earlier in February.Elsewhere, the marine systems division — which does work for the navy — reported a 5.2 per cent rise in revenues to $2bn. The combat systems unit, which builds armoured vehicles and ammunitions for the army, saw sales jump nearly 12 per cent to $1.4bn. The aerospace division was the outlier, with sales dropping 12 per cent to $1.8bn during the quarter.“General Dynamics delivered solid first-quarter results,” said chief executive Phebe Novakovic. “This is a strong start to 2018 and we remain confident in our outlook.”Net income came in at $799m, or $2.70 for the period, compared to the $763m reported in the prior year quarter and handily topped Wall Street forecast of $745m, or $2.47 per share.General Dynamics’ results are likely to add to optimism over the sector, which is expected to benefit from rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East and Russia as well as higher US military spending.Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have both raised their full-year earnings outlook. However Lockheed shares came under heavy selling pressure on Tuesday amid concerns over rising input costs across the industrial sector and after the group failed to raise its outlook for cash flow this year.Shares in General Dynamics, up about 9 per so far this year, climbed 0.9 per cent in pre-market trading.
2;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2018-02-12T18:09:23Z;General Dynamics: the Dwight stuff;Deal for CSRA boosts revenues from IT, but shareholders appear unimpressed;Dwight Eisenhower had it right. The US military-industrial complex only gets more complicated. On Monday, one of the prime US defence contractors, General Dynamics, announced it was acquiring CSRA for nearly $10bn.CSRA sounds dull enough. But it comprises one of the set of alphabet-soup private-sector contractors (along with SAIC, CACI) that service the Pentagon and other federal agencies. Last week, Congress and President Donald Trump revised the constraints from the Budget Control Act. Informally, that law was known as “sequestration” and put a hard lid on defence and social spending. Now that Uncle Sam is spending like a drunken sailor, it is no surprise that defence contractors will try to take advantage.General Dynamics already had an information technology outsourcing unit with $4.5bn in annual revenue. By adding CSRA that rises to $10bn in revenue, making it the second-largest government IT provider. Its willingness to double down is unique. The leading government IT provider, Leidos, is partially a spinout of General Dynamics rival, Lockheed Martin.*In the past, General Dynamics has admitted that its M&A record was “broken”. It likes the IT services segment because of the combination of relatively high profit margin and low risk. General Dynamics said on Monday it believed service businesses were disproportionally hurt compared with defence product programmes by the 2011 sequestration law. As such, service should commensurately bounce back.Shareholders in General Dynamics were neither enthusiastic nor shocked by the deal. The company’s shares basically remained flat. Defence prime contractors have rallied sharply in recent years — not just on the back of a Trump bump (General Dynamics shares are up 60 per cent in the past two years) but also from heavy buyback activity. Shareholders might be wondering if the $10bn for CSRA would be better spent on repurchasing more shares. Such disciplined thinking is no longer at the fore in an era unconstrained by austerity.* This article has been amended to reflect the status of LeidosLex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

3;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2018-02-12T15:48:02Z;General Dynamics buys cyber security specialist CSRA for $9.6bn;Dealmaking in sector heats up following a series of major hacks;General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, has agreed to acquire IT and cyber security group CSRA for $9.6bn, including debt, as dealmaking in the sector heats up following a series of major hacks in recent years.Under the terms of the deal announced on Monday, the Virginia-based company is paying $40.75 cash per CSRA share. That represents a 32 per cent premium to CSRA’s closing price on Friday and values the equity portion of the deal at about $6.68bn. General Dynamics will also assume $2.8bn of CSRA debt.Although General Dynamics is best known as the maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and Navy ships, its biggest unit by revenue is its information systems and technology business, which provides the US government with cyber security systems. The unit generated $8.9bn last year, accounting for nearly 29 per cent of total revenue.There has been a wave of cyber security-focused deals in recent years following a string of high-profile attacks, including Russia’s online meddling with the US presidential election campaign in 2016 and hackings at Equifax, the US data provider.More than 200 cyber security start-ups received venture funding in 2017, according to the Cybersecurity Ventures M&A Report. The biggest deals in the sector included Relx’s £580m purchase of ThreatMetrix, an online identify verification business, and Amazon’s acquisition of Blink, a connected cameras and doorbells security system.Cyber attacks have pushed corporate fraud around the world to an all-time high, forcing large companies to make strategic acquisitions to bolster their anti-hack product offerings.Kroll’s annual global fraud and risk survey showed that 86 per cent of companies around the world reported that they had experienced at least one cyber incident in 2017, a record since the survey was launched.We see substantial opportunities to provide cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agenciesGeneral Dynamics’ takeover of CSRA, which provides IT services including cyber security and data and analytics to the US government, aims to capitalise on the growing demand for security against hacks.“The acquisition of CSRA represents a significant strategic step in expanding the capabilities and customer base of GDIT,” said Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chairman and chief executive.“We see substantial opportunities to provide cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.”The companies said the combination, which they expected to complete by the first half of 2020, would create a business with about $9.9bn in annual revenue.General Dynamics expects the transaction to be accretive to its earnings per share and to free cash flow per share in 2019, and to generate estimated annual pre-tax cost savings of approximately 2 per cent of the combined company’s revenue by 2020.Stone Key Group served as exclusive financial adviser to General Dynamics.

5;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2017-05-21T18:45:42Z;Trump discusses bolstering security ties with Gulf states;US president hopes to rekindle a strategic relationship grown frosty under Obama;President Donald Trump discussed bolstering security ties with Gulf states on Sunday ahead of delivering a much-anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia on Islam, a showpiece of his nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe.The US president received a warm welcome from traditional allies on the tour that so far has been focused on arms and investment deals valued at between $280bn and $380bn and regional opposition to Iran.This contrasts with the more wary relationship between the previous US administration and Sunni Gulf states, which were highly suspicious of Barack Obama’s signature nuclear accord with their rival Iran.On Sunday Mr Trump told King Hamad of Bahrain that there “has been a little strain [between the US and Bahrain] but there won’t be strain with this administration”.Before meeting Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, on Sunday, Mr Trump added: “One of the things that we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the United States.”President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi of Egypt feted Mr Trump as “a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible” — a comment that drew a laugh and the remark “I agree” from the US president.The arms deals agreed on Saturday included a $110bn arms package that the White House said would help Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states face Iranian threats and contribute to counterterrorism operations, “reducing the burden on the US military”, a White House official said.The value of the deals signal a revived partnership that promises Saudi investment into US infrastructure in return for US arms deals for the kingdom.Saudi Arabia is also looking for US support as Riyadh tries to transform its oil-reliant economy after the sustained drop in crude prices triggered a budgetary crisis and rapid deceleration.The kingdom hopes to cement this renewed commercial partnership with a common vision to check Iranian ambitions in the Arab world.Mr Trump on Saturday began a number of political and economic meetings with the Saudi leadership.The king accompanied Mr Trump up a red carpet at the royal terminal of Riyadh’s airport, with the president’s wife Melania following at the back of the small welcoming committee.Mrs Trump, who like many foreign dignitaries did not cover her head or wear the black abaya robe, was nonetheless conservatively dressed in flowing dark trousers and blouse, accessorised with a gold belt.As the president landed, dozens of chief executives from Saudi Arabia and the US were convening at a forum where they discussed Saudi financial flows into America, and how the US could help diversify the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy.“The government is taking a back seat and putting the private sector as the locomotive to drive the economy,” said Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister. “There will be risks but we will work with you to mitigate it.”Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, signed more than $50bn worth of deals on Saturday, around $22bn of which were new memorandums.When deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Washington this year, the White House estimated that Saudi investment pledges could rise to about $200bn.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin signed a $6bn deal to assemble 150 Blackhawk helicopters in the kingdom, supporting 450 jobs. Raytheon and General Dynamics also signed agreements to support the localisation of defence contracts.On Sunday Boeing said it had signed several defence and commercial deals with Saudi Arabia, including the potential sale of up to 16 wide-body commercial aircraft to a Saudi airline, but put no value on the deals. News of the potential commercial wide-body order — the jets in question are expected be twin-aisle 777 and/or 787 jetliners — comes at a time when the wide-body market is soft.The aerospace and defence company said the agreements also included an unspecified number of Chinook helicopters. The US department of state last year informed the US Congress that the administration intended to sell 48 Chinooks to Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom also wanted to acquire an unspecified number of Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft which are based on the 737 commercial aircraft, the company said in a statement.Boeing will also form a new helicopter servicing joint venture in Saudi Arabia, and a Saudi joint venture to provide military maintenance and support to Boeing and non-Boeing products, which analysts said could be one of the most valuable elements of the overall package.The deals support Prince Mohammed’s plans for the world’s third-largest spender on arms to create a domestic industry led by the newly formed company Saudi Arabia Military Industries. The kingdom wants to source half of defence spending locally by 2030 from 2 per cent now.Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund pledged $20bn for a $40bn Blackstone US infrastructure fund, with $20bn to be raised from other parties. Blackstone said it expects, with debt financing, to invest $100bn in infrastructure projects, mainly in the US.“This potential investment reflects our positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the US as announced by President Trump,” said Yasir Al Rumayyan, managing director of PIF.PIF was also an anchor investor in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, which on Saturday finalised its first close at $93bn.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Chicago
6;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2017-02-28T10:59:29Z;US defence spending: guns or butter;Despite the social media rhetoric, contractors should do well from Trump’s policy;“We have to start winning wars again,” explained President Donald Trump on Monday. His plan for victory is to outspend the enemy. It has worked before. Mr Trump’s budget is slated to include a $54bn boost — about a tenth — to the Pentagon spending in fiscal 2018 as well as supplemental spending this year of $30bn. The president views US military might as “depleted”, even though current outlay is equal to that of the next seven highest-spending nations combined.He may have a point. The 2011 austerity law known as sequestration capped defence spending growth just as it did social programmes. Hawks, including Trump critic senator John McCain, have been itching to buy more ships and tanks.For US defence contractors, the occasional presidential tweet accusing them of profligacy is simply an annoyance. They may sell a warplane more cheaply from time to time to humour him. But they will recoup the discount via higher volumes.Lockheed Martin has already withstood a Twitter bombardment over its F-35 jet. The programme is set to cost more than a whopping $400bn overall, double its initial estimate in 2001. The latest F-35 order completed earlier this month is, however, $728m cheaper than the last order, on a unit basis.Mr Trump’s jawboning deserves little credit for this. Incremental orders typically become less expensive. The programme overall is supposed to deliver more than 2,000 jets and there is the chance for the Pentagon to ask for even more. Twitter threats to shift procurement to a rival fighter produced by Boeing are hollow. Weapons systems are complex, as are the legal contracts that frame their procurement.And for all the volatility occasioned by social media activity, Lockheed shares are up nearly a quarter in the last year. Other defence heavyweights such as Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics have made similar moves.To pay for the ramp up, Mr Trump says he favours spending cuts elsewhere while ringfencing social security and Medicare. Guns and butter, however, usually go together. To separate them, either in fiscal expansion or contraction, usually begets its own kind of political war.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
7;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2016-12-23T11:32:29Z;US defence sector learns to live with Trump’s tweets;Social media barrage aimed at political base falls far short of spending plans;America’s biggest defence contractors cannot decide whether to be thrilled or terrified by Donald Trump.The titans of the US defence establishment beat a path to Mr Trump’s Florida resort on Wednesday to hear the president-elect warn that the US government is spending too much money on wasteful, over-budget, out-of-control defence programmes.At the same time, however, Mr Trump has consistently promised a build-up in America’s military — including his ambiguous pledge on Thursday to expand nuclear capability — which is one reason why aerospace and defence sector stocks have risen since election day. For all the bluster, a Trump administration could turn out to be good for the industry.On Wednesday, Boeing and Lockheed Martin sent their chief executives to placate Mr Trump, who has attacked both companies publicly this month. He started by claiming that a project involving Boeing to develop a new version of Air Force One was too expensive. Then he complained on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 — the Pentagon’s next-generation stealth jet being developed by Lockheed Martin — were “out of control”.Then on Thursday, he set one against one the other, turning up the heat under Lockheed by tweeting that he had asked Boeing to price its F-18 Super Hornet combat aircraft as an alternative to the F-35. Boeing tweeted back “ready to work with @realDonaldTrump’s administration to affordably meet US military requirements”.The politics for the White House of taking on defence companies — which often have a broad constituency of support across the country — can be complicated. But if he decides to make an issue of waste, Mr Trump will have some important allies, including John McCain, the Republican who chairs the Senate armed services committee. Mr McCain is likely to oppose some aspects of Mr Trump’s foreign policy, most notably over Russia. However earlier this year he said the F-35 project has “has been both a scandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule and performance”.But many defence industry analysts and insiders are sceptical that the new administration can cut costs as much as Mr Trump has promised. Its Democratic predecessor has already squeezed hard to eliminate waste.“There is nothing wrong in asking hard questions,” says Howard Rubel, defence industry analyst at Jefferies. But the new administration “needs to understand the nuances of the budget, to learn how it all works, like with the presidential aircraft, you learn there is a lot of work to do before you know whether it’s too expensive or not”.Loren Thompson, a consultant who has worked with Lockheed Martin and other defence contractors, argues that unnecessary regulation drives up costs. In the case of the F-35, almost 8,000 test flights are needed before approval. “Every single major weapons system developed by the Pentagon is enmeshed in a framework of regulation that drives up the cost by as much as 20 per cent,” he said.Mr Trump could focus his attention on other targets, too. “Realistically, any big programme is at risk because almost any big defence programme is over-cost or was underperforming at some point,” Jason Gursky, aerospace and defence analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, wrote in a recent note. Mr Gursky highlights risks to the share prices of General Dynamics or Lockheed if the Littoral Combat Ship programme, the subject of debate about cancellation, is targeted by a tweet. Northrop Grumman could sustain tweet damage too, he theorises, though “there is no evidence that any of NOC’s programmes are underperforming”.But Richard Aboulafia, aircraft industry analyst at Teal Group, doubts there is much political traction in going after lower-profile targets than F-35 or Air Force One. “F-35 is the biggest defence contract in history, Air Force One, but beyond that you lose the attention of the political base, which just wants red meat,” he said. “Go after that Blackhawk maintenance contract? Snore. You are serving them broccoli.” Several analysts believe a sustained Twitter campaign could have diminishing impact on stocks: “Paradoxically the more Trump tweets about weapons programmes, the less impact it will have. One tweet out of the blue is a shock, one tweet every week for a month and people start to lose their sensitivity,” says Mr Thompson.Mr Aboulafia points out that, for all the talk of slashing waste, Mr Trump also promises a big increase in overall defence spending, the central pillar of making America great again in the world. “The Trump administration promises great things for defence,” he said. “The only downside: having to suffer through the occasional Trump tweet, aimed at pandering to the base and convincing them that he’s not just going to throw tens of billions of dollars at defence contractors (which he will).”
8;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2016-10-26T12:07:02Z;General Dynamics profits beat but sales slide;;General Dynamics posted better than expected third quarter profits boosted by its IT business that provides the US government with cyber security, but said sales declined more than analysts had forecast.The Virginia-based company said profits slid to $683m or $2.21 a share in the third quarter, compared with $733m or $2.28 a share in the year ago period.The results included an $84m charge tied to the A-12 settlement reached with the US Navy in 2013. The Department of Navy in 1991 terminated a contract with Boeing and General Dynamics to to develop the A-12 aircraft.Earnings from continuing operations were $2.48 a share, topping Wall Street expectations by 10 cents.Sales fell 3.3 per cent to $7.7bn and were shy of analysts’ estimates of $7.9bn.The company’s IT division was the only one to see a rise in revenue — up 5.5 per cent to $2.3bn from a year ago, while operating earnings jumped 17 per cent to $256m.Revenue in its aerospace business tumbled 14 per cent to $2bn, and fell 2.1 per cent in its marine systems business. Operating earnings climbed in every division except marine systems.General Dynamics in July raised its full-year earnings outlook to $9.70 a share, but lowered its sales estimate to $31.5bn. Shares, which have climbed 11 per cent so far this year, rose 0.3 per cent in early trading.
9;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
10;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2016-05-24T05:00:10Z;Bombardier jets operation charts a return to profitability;The aircraft maker looks set for recovery after winning new orders and investment;When Canada’s Bombardier issued first-quarter results on April 28, observers’ attention was focused mainly on good news for the commercial aircraft division.The company was able, after 18 months with no firm new orders for its C Series commercial jet, to announce that Delta Air Lines planned to buy at least 75 of the aircraft, intended to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 narrow-body jets. The order was widely seen as rescuing a programme that, as recently as last year, threatened the future of the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer by sales.Yet the first-quarter performance of Bombardier’s business aircraft division, until recently the world’s biggest supplier of business jets, underlined the price this part of the company has paid for Bombardier’s recent problems. Revenue for the quarter fell 15 per cent to $1.3bn, while earnings before interest and tax also fell 15 per cent to $82m.The falls reflected Bombardier’s decision last year to cut back on production of its top-of-the-range Global 5000 and 6000 business jets, which it had been producing unsustainably fast in an effort to earn cash. The cost and time overruns on the C Series consumed so many of the company’s available resources that it had to postpone by two years entry into service of its Global 7000 and 8000 long-range jets, to 2018 and 2019 respectively.The question for the company is whether Bombardier Business Aircraft can reclaim the powerful market position it has ceded during the past 18 months’ upheavals. Forecasts from the Virginia-based Teal Group project that aircraft delivered by Bombardier will account for only 28 per cent of the total value of business aircraft delivered this year, against 38 per cent for Gulfstream, once a smaller competitor.Alain Bellemare, the chief executive brought in last year to tackle the company’s corporate crisis, told investors after the results were published that the division was “taking a disciplined approach” and adapting to “challenging market conditions”.However, Richard Aboulafia, an analyst for Teal Group, says the C Series’ effect on Bombardier’s business aircraft operation has been “devastating”. He points particularly to the effect on the company of postponing work on the Global 7000 and 8000, which has left Gulfstream, part of General Dynamics, unchallenged as the leader in ultra-long-range aircraft.The extended range version of Gulfstream’s G650 can fly 7,500 nautical miles without refuelling. Such large aircraft have done disproportionately well since the last recession compared with smaller sizes. The Global 8000, when it eventually takes to the air, is due to have a 7,900 nautical mile range.“They gave Gulfstream a six-year lead in the ultra-large market, which was arguably the only growth part of the business in the last few years, because of the delays to the Global 7000 and 8000,” Mr Aboulafia says.They’re unlikely to get their number one position back — certainly not anytime soonThe core of the problem for Bombardier, according to one observer familiar with the company, is that the C Series’ problems have starved development projects across many parts of the company of resources they might otherwise have received. The company last year scrapped its only outstanding development of a smaller business jet — the Learjet 85 — although some observers believe the challenges of producing that innovative aircraft might have justified its cancellation anyway. “I think it’s good [Bombardier] killed it,” says the observer, who asked not to be named.Meanwhile, the sales performance of the Challenger 350 — which entered into service in 2014 — and many of the company’s other midsize aircraft has proved disappointing. Competitors such as Gulfstream’s new G500 have been taking market share. “They haven’t been winning their share of that market,” the observer says.Bombardier declined to comment.Yet the Delta C Series order is not the only reason to hope that Bombardier’s business aircraft division may be past the worst. A $1.3bn investment in the company’s trainmaking business, by a pension fund linked to the government of Bombardier’s native province of Québec, helped to keep net debt for the group steady at $6.35bn at the end of March compared with December.The company is also due to receive a $1bn investment from Québec’s provincial government in a joint venture to build the C Series. It is in negotiations about a potential investment from the Canadian federal government.Mr Bellemare told investors in April that the further investments would give the company “additional flexibility” and the ability to keep investing.He also predicted that, in cutting back production rates last year, the company had acted more promptly than other companies during difficult market conditions.“We were proactive. We took some tough actions last year, but they are starting to pay off this year,” said Mr Bellemare.Yet there is little doubt that events over the past few years — when Bombardier struggled to invest in new products — will have a lasting effect on the business. Mr Aboulafia reflects how the company once offered strong products across the whole size range, from its smaller Learjets up to the Global products — which were the first truly intercontinental business aircraft. “They’re unlikely to get their number one position back — certainly not anytime soon,” he says.
11;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2015-11-16T17:08:29Z;Aviation industry outlook remains cloudy;Manufacturers’ conflicting messages reflect mixed fortunes;For anyone seeking to understand the state of the business jet market, the three weeks at the end of April and start of May were a confusing time.On April 29, Phebe Novakovic, chief executive of General Dynamics, expressed cautious but unmistakable optimism about prospects for the US aerospace and defence company’s Gulfstream business jet operation as she discussed its first-quarter results.“We always pull production down in the face of weak orders,” she said. “We have no intention of doing so this year.”On May 14, however, Canada’s Bombardier, which in January had stopped work on its new Learjet 85 corporate jet, made it clear Ms Novakovic’s optimism was not universally shared. Weak demand was forcing it to cut production of its biggest, most expensive aircraft — the Global 5000 and Global 6000.“We have seen an industry-wide softness in demand recently in certain international markets and are taking steps to adjust our production accordingly,” Éric Martel, the then president of Bombardier Business Aircraft, said.The conflicting messages partly reflect how mixed 2015 has been for business aircraft makers. Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace consultancy, predicts that 713 business jets will be delivered during 2015. Although the figure is an improvement on the 672 delivered in 2012, it is a slight fall from the 722 delivered in 2014 and highlights how far the industry is from again hitting the record 1,318 delivered in 2008.The picture has also been different for companies serving different parts of the world and in different size categories. Deliveries at the top end of the size range have held remarkably steady throughout the economic downturn. Gulfstream is projected this year to deliver 115 of its largest-cabin jets — the G450, G550 and G650 — down slightly from 117 last year. Bombardier’s production of its flagship Global 5000 and 6000 is set to fall to 68, from 80 in 2014.Chad Anderson, president of JetCraft, a North Carolina-based private jet broker, says the strength in big aircraft reflects the growing number of companies that need long-range, fast jets to visit locations across the globe.“More often than not, our clients’ business demands have globalised, not shrunk,” Mr Anderson says. “That has required a lot more capable aeroplanes in terms of range requirements.”$5.4bnCost to Bombardier of building the C Series so farIt is less clear, however, whether a recovery in midsize jets — anticipated since demand collapsed during the economic crisis in 2008 — will be sustained, even if there are optimistic signs. Cessna is due to deliver 170 aircraft this year in its midsize Citation range, up 7 per cent on 2014. That segment has benefited from robust economic recovery in the US, the biggest market for business jets.“There’s still an intra-continental requirement for some users,” Mr Anderson says. “North American users who still have local requirements can very well utilise the midsize and light jet aircraft.”The smallest light-jet segment, which was once expected to boom as a series of manufacturers launched very cheap models, looks set to remain a modest part of the market. JetCraft says very light, light and superlight jets will account for only $25bn of the $271bn revenue that it projects the industry will earn from new jets up to the end of 2024.Alain Bellemare, Bombardier’s chief executive, cited the “very soft” market for smaller jets as the reason for cancelling the midsize Learjet 85 programme altogether, after the project was initially put on hold in January.The whole industry’s prospects, meanwhile, have been further clouded by the sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities, and the poor performance of European and emerging market economies that had produced many of the industry’s recent orders.Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, Cessna’s parent, told investors during the third-quarter earnings call that he was “reasonably happy” with the US market for business jets.713Number of business jets likely to be delivered in 2015But he went on: “There’s no question that the markets in Europe and Asia are challenged. I think part of that is just the economies are in a pretty difficult spot. Of course, the US dollar being quite strong puts some additional pressure on that in terms of all the product lines.”Yet an important dynamic in the market, one critical in understanding Bombardier’s take on market conditions, relates to the plight of Bombardier, which manufactures more business jets than any other and is projected to have 32.2 per cent of the market this year by revenue.The company faces a serious corporate crisis as it struggles to fund the costs — $5.4bn so far — of developing its C Series commercial jet, a competitor to Airbus’s A320 family and Boeing’s 737.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, says the crisis — which pushed net debt up to $6.8bn at the end of the third quarter — prompted Bombardier to increase Global 5000 and 6000 production to unsustainable rates in the hope of bringing in cash. “They just got very aggressive about commercial terms, did everything they could to bring in orders,” Mr Aboulafia says.May’s announcement of a scaling-back of production reflected the unsustainability of Bombardier’s earlier production levels rather than wider weakness in demand, says Mr Aboulafia.The flood of new aircraft, many purchased at knockdown prices, has had knock-on effects across the market. Discussing General Dynamics’ third-quarter results, Ms Novakovic referred darkly to “non-macro headwinds” in the third quarter because “a competitor” was selling some aircraft at “very low prices”.“Now, inevitably, that part of the market has problems,” Mr Aboulafia says.Yet Bombardier’s cash crunch is likely to shape the long-term competitive landscape in the industry. The crisis has forced the company to postpone introduction of its long-range Global 7000 and 8000 aircraft by two years.The company is falling behind a wave of innovation. Cessna will show its new midsize Longitude jet at this week’s convention of the US National Business Aviation Association in Las Vegas. Gulfstream is developing the G500 and G600 as new, higher-technology replacements for its existing G450 and G550 models, and as competitors to the Global 5000 and 6000. France’s Dassault Aviation is simultaneously developing its new Falcon 5X and 8X business jets.Mr Anderson expects that the loyalty of Bombardier customers will ensure that it retains a substantial market share. JetCraft projects that the company will still take 30 per cent of industry revenues in 2024.However, Bombardier’s slow development of its biggest, newest aircraft has prompted a rash of speculation that rivals will develop big, new aircraft to take on Gulfstream’s leadership of the lucrative luxury of the market. Cessna may unveil plans for a longer-range Longitude at NBAA, while Dassault may eventually, observers believe, produce an aircraft able to fly 7,000 nautical miles without refuelling, as the G650 can.While Bombardier may continue to deliver more aircraft and bring in more revenue than its rivals, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a gradual shift in the industry’s leadership is under way.
12;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2015-07-07T11:51:14Z;Gulfstream finds its flight path with spacious business jets;Investment in downturn has posed challenge to rivals;"Even when the workers who build Gulfstream’s G650 business jet are on a break, it is easy to see that the world’s longest-range business jet is in demand. Every corner of the assembly building, on the edge of the historic port city of Savannah, is filled with components for new aircraft. Fuselages in various states of construction are jammed in nose to tail. Outside, aircraft wait to be fitted with luxurious interiors before heading off to start shuttling the world’s business and political elite between continents.The G650, introduced in 2012, is the most obvious illustration of how Gulfstream, part of General Dynamics, the military contractor, is benefiting from the resilient demand from the world’s wealthiest flyers for the most capable private aircraft. Demand for large jets — which accounted for 117 of the 150 aircraft that Gulfstream delivered last year — continued to grow throughout the economic downturn, fuelled by new demand from China and other emerging markets. Orders for the smaller aircraft popular with US and European companies for shorter trips slumped.Gulfstream’s focus on the large, high-value end of the market looks set to turn it soon into the world’s largest business jet manufacturer by revenues. Gulfstream produced $6.98bn of General Dynamics’ $8.65bn aerospace revenue last year, up 9 per cent on the year before, and aerospace operating profit margins were 18.6 per cent. The list price for each G650ER — an extended range version that can travel 7,500 nautical miles without refuelling — is $66.5m.Researchers play a vital role in helping to develop the world’s fastest, long-range business jets, the FT’s Robert Wright discoversBy contrast, Canada’s Bombardier, which reported $7.2bn in business jet revenues and was far less profitable, has been forced to cut back. In January, it put development of a new, smaller jet — the Learjet 85— on hold, citing poor market conditions. In May, it cut back production of its flagship products, the Global 5000 and Global 6000 long-range jets. France’s Dassault Aviation, the only other competitor in the large-cabin business jet market, generated revenues from business jets of €2.68bn in 2014.Scott Neal, Gulfstream’s head of sales and marketing, says Gulfstream stood out for its willingness to invest throughout the economic downturn.“Even though economic conditions changed, we continued to invest in our product line,” he says.The challenge for Gulfstream is to maintain that strong position as it shifts its focus towards developing two new, shorter-range aircraft — the G500 and G600 — designed to fly, like the G650, at 0.9 times the speed of sound. Their list prices are $43.5m and $54.5m, respectively.“The feedback that we’ve heard from the customers is that they really liked the speed capability of the 650; they liked the technology of the 650,” says Steve Cass, Gulfstream’s head of technical marketing and communications. “So they wanted to see that type of technology but put into an airplane that didn’t fly as far and didn’t cost as much.”One of the key reasons for Gulfstream’s strong market position relates less to what it has done than to what Bombardier has not done, according to Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group. While customers have been operating the G650 since 2012 and the G650ER since 2014, Bombardier’s competing products — the Global 7000 and 8000— have not yet had even their first test flight. Both aircraft are due to match the G650’s speed, while the Global 8000 is projected to have a longer, 7,900-nautical mile range.Bombardier has instead been focused on its C Series commercial jet, which has so far cost $5.4bn to develop, faced severe delays and won only modest orders.Since Dassault’s Falcon 8x, its longest-range aircraft, has a range of only 6,450 nautical miles, Gulfstream has had the top end of the market to itself.“It’s going to be another few years before Bombardier finally can respond,” Mr Aboulafia says. “The G650 is bringing in a lot of money and earning Gulfstream a lot of market share.”Dassault looks unlikely to tackle Gulfstream head-on in its effort to provide customers with ever faster, ever longer-range aircraft.Olivier Villa, Dassault’s senior vice-president, says that many customers own only one or two jets and will prize efficiency over extreme high performance. He adds that one loyal customer with facilities in the US told him that high speed was less valuable to him than having a jet versatile enough to land on short runways near his company’s remote facilities.“What we try to do is a real business jet, meaning that you can be efficient and fly long-range but that you can also land where others cannot,” Mr Villa says. “We believe it’s our strength and strategy for the future.”Gulfstream’s future, meanwhile, is being worked out in a series of buildings a short drive from the G650 production site, where technicians sit staring at screens amid rigs set up to mimic the flight deck of the future G500 or the G600. They are working on innovations such as a single, interconnected data system that will replace traditional wires and make the aircraft lighter.“The goal with that is we want to deliver the most mature product from the very first one to our customer base to meet or exceed their expectations,” says Scott Evans, one of Gulfstream’s senior test pilots.Yet, whatever the new aircraft’s technical niceties, the most important fact about the G500 and G600 may be simply that they are so close to coming into service, according to Mr Aboulafia. The G500’s first flight was in May and deliveries to customers are due in 2018. The G600 is expected to run around a year behind.According to Mr Aboulafia, Gulfstream’s current advantages show that it has grasped two longstanding principles of the business jet market.“One is: seize the high end,” he says. “Two is: don’t let your product line get old.”When Gulfstream announced that its G650 would fly at a maximum speed of Mach 0.925, Cessna, the previous holder of the record for fastest business jet, acted fast. It brought out a new, lighter version of its medium-size but high-speed Citation. This Citation X+ was capable of Mach 0.935, nearly the speed of sound.The question for business jet makers is whether they should push on from these high subsonic — or trans-sonic — speeds to tackle the multiple technical and regulatory challenges of returning civilians to supersonic flight. While Aerion, a small US company, has been trying for many years to raise funding for a supersonic business jet, there have been no civilian supersonic aircraft since the Concorde retired in 2003.It is a question to which both Gulfstream and Dassault Aviation say they have devoted significant attention. Supersonic flight imposes very different strains on aircraft from subsonic travel, produces unpleasant sonic booms when the aircraft crosses the sound barrier and consumes far more fuel than normal flight.Olivier Villa, senior vice-president of Dassault Aviation, says there might be demand for shuttles by jet-sharing services using supersonic aircraft on the busiest, most popular routes. But his company cooled on the idea of producing such an aircraft after realising that it would have to be so big it would be able to use only large, international airports, rather than the smaller, specialist airfields that business jet users generally prefer.“For our average customer, who owns one or two aircraft and needs to be able to use it for everyday work, that’s a very expensive and inefficient solution,” Mr Villa says.Gulfstream, meanwhile, says that it is “monitoring” developments in the field. It is particularly concerned that US regulations currently ban any civilian supersonic flights over land in the US, because of the risk of sonic booms. Gulfstream has nevertheless looked at aircraft designs that would change the character of sonic booms, making them less abrupt.“If it reaches a technological readiness that makes sense, it’s in the considerations next time,” says Scott Evans, one of Gulfstream’s senior test pilots."
13;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2015-06-23T16:28:58Z;Defence contractors: Upward trajectory;Stagnation in government spending on defence has not prevented a re-rating in the sector;"Donald Rumsfeld, the former US defence secretary, was fond of talking about “known knowns”. Western defence spending is one such certainty: it has been falling.Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think-tank, show that global real-terms defence spending fell in each of the past three years, led by the US. Only in Africa, Asia and the Middle East is spending increasing.But the share prices of major defence contractors betray little trace of this trend. Valuations have grown richer; back in 2012, defence contractors’ shares often traded below 10 times forecast earnings. Above 15 is now more common. True, multiple expansion without much earnings growth has been common in equity markets boosted by quantitative easing. Share buybacks have also played a part — Raytheon is spending $2bn buying its own stock. But the big groups have been operationally robust, too; over the past two years, most of the top quartile of defence contractors by market value have reported improved operating margins, according to S&P CapitalIQ.Exposure to the right programmes and niches is key. These include the $400bn F35 Joint Strike Fighter and the K-46 air tanker, anything related to submarines and — in the UK especially — aircraft carriers, along with cyber and electronic warfare. The ability to sell existing kit to export markets, or to adapt military technology for civilian applications, is another bonus.Governments are increasingly wary of “boots on the ground”, and the outlook for companies exposed to direct conflict is more challenging. Chemring, a UK maker of countermeasures and sensors, was forced to sell assets and part company with its chief executive after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ended. On Tuesday it reported a first-half loss because of contract delays.But the broader recovery has only brought defence stock valuations level with the broader market. There are few reasons to think they will not remain there, barring unforeseen setbacks — or, in Rumsfeld-speak, “unknown unknowns”.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
14;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2015-05-14T17:25:25Z;Bombardier flies into jet set turbulence;Canadian group cuts jobs and slows output of its high-end private aircraft;Canada’s Bombardier on Thursday blamed a waning appetite for private jets from Chinese tycoons and Russia’s oligarchs for forcing it to cut 1,750 jobs and slow down production of its high-end business jets.The production cuts for the Global 5000 and 6000 — which whisk chief executives and plutocrats between continents — are the latest setback as Bombardier grapples with the high costs and lacklustre order book of its C Series commercial jet.However, Bombardier’s description of the market bemused its leading competitor and a senior analyst, who both predict continued strong demand from the rich to fly around in the ultimate in luxury.Bombardier said that “current economic conditions and geopolitical issues” in Latin America, China and Russia had hit its new orders across the business jet market.Yet Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, insisted that the global corporate jet market continued to enjoy growth — “not great growth, but OK growth”.Demand for the very largest corporate jets has remained resolutely robust since the financial crisis, according to Teal figures. The aggregate value of annual deliveries of jets costing more than $26m grew 29 per cent between 2008 and last year. Annual deliveries of aircraft costing less than $26m fell 52 per cent over the same period.Mr Aboulafia blamed Bombardier’s rapid recent increases in production for its decision to cut back. Its two rivals in the large business jet market — France’s Dassault Aviation and General Dynamics’ Gulfstream — had increased production more slowly and reported no such need to slow down.“This idea of shrinking in this market — that’s so far a Bombardier problem and I think it will stay that way,” Mr Aboulafia said.Gulfstream confirmed it was standing by its forecast that in 2015 it would produce 115 large-cabin aircraft, about the same as last year, and 10 more medium-cabin aircraft than in 2014.Bombardier declined to comment on how its strategy compared with competitors’. Teal predicts that Bombardier will produce 75 Global 5000 and 6000 aircraft this year and 69 in 2016. The company built 80 of the two models in 2014.Up to 1,000 of the Bombardier job cuts will fall around Montreal, 480 around Toronto and 280 in Belfast, in Northern Ireland, the company said.Bombardier announced in a profit warning in January that it was halting development work on a smaller business jet, the Learjet 85. It announced last week that it was planning an IPO of its train making business later this year.Bombardier has been struggling to fund the $5.4bn development cost of the C Series — intended to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 family. The company has won only 243 firm orders for the aircraft, below its target of 300.Bombardier’s B Shares, which have fallen by a third since the start of the year, were up 3.1 per cent at lunchtime in Toronto, to C$2.63.
15;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2014-09-02T17:33:12Z;British Army to get armour boost;;David Cameron is to announce an order of nearly 600 new infantry vehicles for the British army this week at the Nato summit in Wales as part of an effort to demonstrate the UK’s commitment to higher defence spending.With Russia taking military action in Ukraine, this Nato summit has become the most important for the alliance in more than 20 years. Defence spending set to be central.The prime minister will unveil plans to buy 589 Scout armoured reconnaissance units from General Dynamics UK as a milestone in a multibillion-pound project that has been in gestation for years, people familiar with Number 10’s thinking told the Financial Times.The vehicles, which are being developed in Wales at a site a few miles from the summit near Cardiff, will be fitted with advanced communications devices needed for modern warfare.The government has earmarked funding to the Scout project as part of its long-running Future Rapid Effect System to upgrade its infantry vehicles. It paid £500m in 2010 to develop seven prototype vehicles. These were unveiled by General Dynamics in June this year following trials.Army chiefs are likely to welcome the plans at a time when headlines have been dominated by expenditure on the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.Many in the army have been frustrated at the delays to overhauling their equipment. FRES, which involves projects for several different types of integrated vehicle systems, has been in development since 2006.Downing St has been considering bringing forward other defence spending announcements before the election, including a replacement for the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft, thanks to a belief that more importance needs to be given to security and defence issues.While the announcements are likely to draw attention to the UK as Nato’s most significant European member in terms of defence spending, they will come against a still-bleak broader outlook for British military finances.The UK is one of only four Nato members who meet a spending target of 2 per cent or more of GDP on its armed forces. However, this is forecast to fall significantly in the coming months.The government is committed to a freeze on any increase in spending on personnel and to a 1 per cent annual increase in equipment. If such plans are maintained, with a growing economy and with army spending due to dip anyway as troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, the proportion of GDP spent on the military could fall to as low as 1.7 per cent, some experts say.Meanwhile, some expect the cost of defence projects to rise. Recent independent research for the Ministry of Defence suggested Britain was facing a “black hole” in defence spending after 2015.The MoD has not enjoyed privileged status with the Treasury in recent years and cuts have hit military capabilities hard. Under plans to rely on more volunteer soldiers, the army has shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic wars.Some are hopeful that the crisis in Ukraine as well as the attention drawn by the Nato summit in Wales may have helped to refocus political opinion on the matter at Downing Street.
16;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2014-05-25T12:41:24Z;Wales flags up ambitions as cyber security hub;;The US indictment last week of five Chinese military officials over alleged cyber security breaches should be welcome news to the Welsh government, which in September will host 28 heads of government at a NATO summit.With cyber threats now a priority for the defence alliance, Wales hopes in hosting the two-day event to flag up its own ambitions to become a UK hub for cyber security companies.The annual cost of cyber crime in the UK is officially put at between £18bn and £27bn, whether from hackers, organised crime or, as the US alleges in the case of the Chinese officers, unfriendly governments.The value of goods and services provided by UK companies combating the threat is currently estimated at £2.8bn. It is set to grow to £3.4bn by 2017, increasing at almost three times the rate of the IT sector overall.The Edge Innovation Centre in Newbridge in South Wales, which General Dynamics set up after winning a £2bn contract to supply the Bowman tactical radio-based communications system contract for the British army, has worked with around 250 supply chain companies in the last five years.The purpose of the collaboration is to “pull through” clever civilian technology that can be used to help the UK military.But the centre also helps smaller companies find a civilian market for their defence products.One such company is Extreme Cases, based in Devon. It was asked by General Dynamics to design a rugged carrier for a handheld projector.Smartbeam, an interactive planning tool, operates using the Bowman secure network to provide soldiers with an electronic view of the battlefield.Mark Brown, marketing director of Extreme Cases, says the product has been trialled by UK Special Forces and has been sold in Germany and Poland.It is now looking for civilian uses for organisations like the Red Cross and mountain rescue units.“What the Edge centre does is it helps companies identify a route to market,” says Ian Menzies, a director at General Dynamics UK. “So this not about taking their IP (intellectual property). We realise that, for small companies, that is their lifeblood.”Wales is doing its bit. In November, the UK government’s Technology Strategy Board identified Cardiff and Newport as part of a Severn Valley Cyber Launchpad, an initiative aimed at encouraging cyber security start-ups.The lower Severn valley is said already to account for 14 per cent of the UK’s cyber security businesses.The area includes the companies around GCHQ, the government’s secret communications centre in Cheltenham, and also the cluster around Malvern, where Qinetiq, the privatised arm of the government’s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, has a large operation.Wales should have a head start, boasting two of the world’s leading cyber security defence contractors.Cassidian, now rebranded as Airbus Defence & Space and part of the European defence and aerospace consortium, is a leader in encryption technology for both military and civilian use.It employs around 600 people at its facility near Newport. One of its best-known contracts was supplying the Houses of Parliament with a secure communications system.General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, employs around 500 people at an old colliery site in Caerphilly, one of the most economically depressed parts of Wales.It set up in 2001 after wining a £2bn contract with the Ministry of Defence to supply t he Bowman secure battlefield radio system, now in use in Afghanistan.Earlier this month, the MoD awarded two additional contracts worth £364m, to provide continuing design, engineering and logistic support for a further five years. This will secure 140 of the jobs at the south Wales facility, although Welsh government officials say few of the employees are locals.To address the concern that they have not done enough to foster the local economy, both contractors have set up incubators to try to “pull through” some smart civilian technologies for military use.General Dynamics’ Edge Innovation Centre in Newbridge is a collaboration that has helped 250 companies in the last five years.Itsus Consulting is an example of a small cyber security company started by an ex-Cassidian employee and helped by the Edge Innovation Centre.Shahid Mian, the founder, says the cyber threat to the economy “offers huge opportunities for small companies like ours”.Foreign companies, too, are starting to recognise the region’s potential. In April, Wales was able to beat off competition from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic to win an investment by Alert Logic.The fast-growing Texas-based company, which specialises in cyber security services for companies operating in the cloud, is setting up a European headquarters in Cardiff, creating 130 well-paid jobs.One attraction was the availability of skills at the University of South Wales, the UK’s second-largest dedicated cyber security department after Royal Holloway College in London.“So we’re not growing our skills base from nothing,” says Andrew Blyth, professor of computer forensics, who leads the university’s cyber security research team.
17;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2014-01-22T18:38:47Z;US aerospace groups cite mixed demand;;Two of the biggest suppliers in the US aerospace industry on Wednesday announced a mixture of strong demand from commercial customers and declining military demand, a pattern likely to be replicated in many company results.United Technologies Corp, builder of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, said commercial aerospace demand in last year’s fourth quarter was 14 per cent up on the previous year and military demand 8 per cent down.General Dynamics, one of the biggest suppliers to the US Defence Department, also reported strong growth in its aerospace segment – which supplies Gulfstream business jets– and significant declines in two of its three military divisions.However, Greg Hayes, UTC’s chief financial officer, said developments in Washington – where a budget deal has ended some of the across-the-board sequestration spending cuts– were “encouraging” for military spending.Airlines and corporate aviation providers have been rushing to re-equip their fleets with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, creating a surge of orders. The US military has been cutting spending both through the sequestration cuts and because of the military drawdown in Afghanistan.Fourth-quarter net income for UTC, which makes building systems such as lifts as well as aerospace equipment, declined 29 per cent to $1.46bn against the same period in the previous year, when figures benefited from a $2.09bn gain on a business disposal. Net sales grew 2 per cent to $16.8bn.Full-year net income grew 11.5 per cent to $5.72bn, on net sales up 8.5 per cent to $57.7bn.GD’s fourth-quarter net income was $495m, on revenues up 0.4 per cent to $8.11bn, against a $2.13bn loss in 2012’s fourth quarter, when the company took $2.3bn in impairment charges.Mr Hayes said that in UTC’s aerospace businesses the strength of commercial demand had “more than offset” the weakness in defence.Pratt & Whitney’s fourth-quarter operating profits grew 27 per cent to $464m, on sales up 5.1 per cent to $4.09bn, while profits in UTC Aerospace Systems grew 96 per cent to $517m on sales up 8.7 per cent to $3.45bn. In Sikorsky helicopters, where declining military demand outweighed growing demand from oil and gas companies, net income grew 18 per cent to $189m, on sales down 13 per cent to $1.9bn.“It’s an accelerating top line to go along with an improving economic environment,” Mr Hayes said of commercial aerospace demand.At GD, fourth-quarter aerospace operating earnings grew from $69m in 2012 to $348m in 2013, on sales up 15 per cent to $2.13bn. Sales in combat systems declined 16.4 per cent. Turnover for information systems and technology – one of the areas hardest hit by sequestration – grew 4.4 per cent.UTC’s shares rose in afternoon trading by 1.13 per cent to $116.29, while GD’s climbed 4.14 per cent to $99.25.
18;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-09-16T14:57:30Z;Defence contractors face changes to long-term government ties;;"At a dinner in the autumn of 1993 now known as “the last supper”, the US deputy secretary of defence told industry executives that budget cuts meant there would no longer be room at the table for all of them.The speech set off a wave of consolidation that created today’s defence industry, dominated by a handful of big US players, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman.By the end of the decade the merger wave had reached the other side of the Atlantic, where BAE Systems and EADS rose to dominate the defence and aerospace market.The cuts in US military spending in this downturn are expected to be as aggressive as those that accompanied the end of the cold war. But defence executives at last week’s DSEI, the big industry show in the UK, are far less in concert when it comes to forecasting whether that would again lead to profound change within the industry.Cash-strapped Nato governments, which have already slashed their defence budgets by $120bn in the past three years, face a difficult choice: push the industry to become more efficient so defence departments can procure military equipment more cheaply and quickly or protect the industry– together with its jobs and skills – by favouring local production.“On the one hand [governments] want competitive products; on the other hand they want to buy from companies that create jobs in their own countries,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Thales, the French defence electronics group. “You cannot have the best of both worlds; it just does not work.”Håkan Buskhe, president and chief executive of Saab, Sweden’s biggest defence contractor, expects to see significant change.“The fact is that we are running out of money,” he said. “And that, in other types of business, without the influence in politicians, normally restricts the business and I think that is the way it should be done.”Signs across Europe and in the US suggest governments agree with Mr Buskhe.The UK has said it wants to buy off the shelf where possible. It also decided – despite much industry lobbying – to exclude the employment or tax benefits of buying from nationally-based contractors in its “value for money” equation.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence – under pressure from parliament – is seeking to renegotiate contracts that it can no longer afford. These contracts have helped retain jobs and engineering skills by keeping shipyards and factories open even during a lag in orders.In August, the French government hit Dassault Aviation by cutting its orders for the Rafale fighter jet in half just as the group was battling to clinch a contract with India, its only export partner. Meanwhile, Paris reduced its stake in EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence company.In the US – despite dire warnings from top military leaders and defence company chief executives – politicians unleashed automatic, across-the-board cuts on the defence budget amid a March battle to reduce the national deficit. The Pentagon is pushing for supply contracts that shift more of the endemic risk of cost overruns and delays to its contractors.On the one hand [governments] want competitive products; on the other hand they want to buy from companies that create jobs in their own countries. You cannot have the best of both worlds; it just does not workBut among all the examples of governments getting tough with their military suppliers, there are also signs that governments are resisting more radical change, at least for now.The UK’s secretary of defence last week at DSEI promised to oppose efforts by the European Commission to streamline the industry.Meanwhile, Paris has resisted calls by TCI, an activist investor, to get rid of overlap in the shareholdings of its big defence companies.But the biggest barrier to European consolidation stands in Berlin, which last year vetoed the €36bn tie-up of EADS and BAE Systems.The Pentagon also appears in no mood for big industry consolidation, even as its procurement budget is set to halve over the coming decade.Analysts say the more likely victims this time will be the smaller companies further down the supply chain, especially those that make the kinds of products – land vehicles and night vision goggles, for example – whose need has diminished with the end of major deployment to Afghanistan.In an industry that cannot make any major moves without the blessing of its governments, the political message appears to be: deal with the cuts but steer clear of radical solutions.But that could change over the coming three to five years as work ends on big existing domestic programmes, such as the UK’s aircraft carriers, and exports fail to pick up the slack. If that happens, employment and companies’ bottom lines may suffer enough to warrant a more profound reform of the industry.For years, analysts, politicians and defence executives have highlighted the inefficiencies and duplications of Europe’s defence industry and argued that significant reforms were needed, writes Carola Hoyos.In France, there are large overlaps in ownership of the big defence contractors, some of which fiercely compete with each other.France, Germany and Spain have stakes in EADS, while EADS owns 46.3 per cent of Dassault Aviation, with the majority of the remaining stake owned by the Dassault family.Thales, meanwhile, is part owned by the French state, with Dassault Aviation holding the other sizeable stake.More than a quarter of Safran, the engine maker, is owned by the French state, with another 15 per cent owned by its employees.The overlap between EADS, Dassault and Thales is particularly interesting when one considers that the biggest competitor of Dassault’s Rafale fighter jet is Eurofighter’s Typhoon, of which EADS is the biggest stakeholder.Meanwhile, Thales provides electronics systems for both.These ownership overlaps force EADS, Dassault, Thales and the French government to compete against each other in some of the world’s biggest international tenders for military equipment."
19;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Beechcraft eyes return to profit fuelled by mining group orders;;Beechcraft has predicted it will return to profit this year, only months after emerging from bankruptcy protection, as it benefits from demand for its propeller-driven aircraft from the natural resource industry.Bill Boisture, chief executive of the business aircraft manufacturer, said orders from mining and oil-drilling companies and the US defence department had bolstered the group. However, he accepted that the business aviation market would remain weak for some time as it endures weak demand and a glut of aircraft.“Forecasters say for the next 10 to 14 months it looks about how it looks now,” Mr Boisture said. “There are reasons for optimism in certain areas, but there are offsetting problems in other parts of the world.”The company is focusing on slower, but less fuel-hungry, basic piston-powered and faster turbo-prop aircraft. These are cheaper than their jet counterparts and can land almost anywhere.Beechcraft has been building three of its flagship King Air turboprops a week since it emerged from bankruptcy, Mr Boisture said.Among the biggest buyers of the aircraft were mining and other natural resource companies, which need aircraft that are capable of landing in remote areas with poorly-equipped airfields.“The aircraft’s ability to fly for a long time without much support makes it ideal for places where lots of natural resource development is going on,” Mr Boisture said.Beechcraft also announced on August 1 an order for up to 105 King Air 350i aircraft from Wheels Up, a new aircraft ownership club that offers members access to aircraft for trips around their region of the US. Including maintenance and other support work, Beechcraft valued the order at $1.4bn.Beechcraft, formerly known as Hawker Beechcraft, emerged from nine months under bankruptcy protection in February. During that time it reorganised its pension and healthcare obligations and shed 85 per cent of its $2.2bn net debt.The name change followed the closure of its Hawker business, which faced intense competition from large commercial jet manufacturers and specialists such as General Dynamics’ Gulfstream.The bankruptcy attracted attention because the company spent several months discussing a potential sale to Superior Aviation Beijing, which said it would retain the Hawker jet business.Executives at the company had grown concerned, Mr Boisture said, about whether the US government would approve the sensitive sale and whether Superior had the necessary approvals from the Chinese government. It eventually abandoned the Superior talks in the interests of exiting bankruptcy quickly to restore customer confidence.That decision had been vindicated because the company – now controlled by its pre-bankruptcy creditors – would be profitable this year, Mr Boisture said.“We’re emerging as a strong American manufacturing company, with a niche product focus,” he said.
20;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-07-24T21:55:38Z;US military contractors: what sequestration?;The effect of austerity on weapons makers has been mild;Austerity is, in principle, a bad thing for the big weapons makers that serve the US military. So far, though, austerity has mostly stayed at the level of principle.Lockheed Martin reported financial results on Tuesday that might make one forget that sequestration – the indiscriminate spending cuts meant to trim a tenth from every line in the Pentagon’s budget – went into effect in March. Revenue in the last quarter fell a bit but margins expanded and earnings per share rose 11 per cent. Profit targets for the year were bumped up. On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported flat revenue and earnings – a better result than Wall Street had projected – and gave its earnings targets an upward nudge. Also on Wednesday, Northrop Grumman reported flat sales and earnings up 9 per cent. It inched targets up, too.Budget strains did show up here and there. Products with shorter delivery cycles, such as information technology and consulting, are being hit. Lockheed’s and Northrup’s information systems segments both saw sales drop. The wind-down of the war in Afghanistan may be having an effect too. General Dynamics’s combat systems division, which makes tanks and vehicles, saw revenue fall by a quarter. But most products with long cycles – aircraft, ships – are doing fine.Over the past six months or so the three companies’ shares have risen in lockstep and their valuations have reached roughly 12 times forward earnings – post-crisis highs. It is an open question, however, how much of that has to do with the fact that austerity turns out, in the military’s case, to be a slow process and how much of it has to do with the shrinking risk premiums for equities in general. It is at the very least possible that the fate of investors in military contractors depends less on the Department of Defence than on the Federal Reserve.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
21;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-07-24T18:09:53Z;Industrials upgrades mark strength of US economic recovery;;Some of the US’s biggest industrial companies have provided further evidence of how a domestic economic recovery and continued federal spending are underpinning corporate earnings.On Wednesday, Boeing, Ford and Northrop Grumman all increased their guidance for full-year profits.Ford raised its forecasts, saying that it expected to “equal or exceed” last year’s $8bn net earnings this year, rather than merely matching it, while Boeing increased its earnings guidance by 2 per cent – to a range of $5.10 to $5.30 per share.But it was Northrop Grumman, the US’s second-biggest pure military contractor by sales, that announced the biggest forecast earnings increase, raising its guidance by 10 per cent, to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share.The figures suggested a sharp turnround in the relative fortunes of the US economy, and the economies of formerly fast-growing emerging markets.Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving and construction equipment, and one of the US industrial companies most exposed to emerging markets, cut its full-year forecast for the second successive quarter, by 7 per cent, to $6.50 per share. It said it had suffered from a winding down of dealers’ inventories and the continuing mining slump.Bob Shanks, CFO of Ford, the most obvious beneficiary of the US’s economic rebound, said he expected North America to continue to be a “strong performer” for the company.Ford’s North American pre-tax profits – which were boosted by the US’s fast-rising car demand – were 16 per cent up on last year’s second quarter, at $2.3bn.Mr Shanks said: “Our big opportunity is to take the operations outside of North America and get them contributing fairly, if you will, to the overall business.”Boeing benefited from the strength of worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft, including the problematic 787 Dreamliner. The company delivered 13 per cent more aircraft in the second quarter than in the same quarter of 2012 to airlines worldwide.The continuing strength of worldwide aircraft demand also helped General Dynamics – the maker of Gulfstream corporate jets – improve the operating profits in its aerospace division by 51 per cent, to $389m.Boeing also benefited from the continuing strength of demand from the US’s defence department, which helped the group’s operating profit rise 4 per cent to $776m on revenue that was flat at $8.2bn.Northrop Grumman reported still stronger demand from the Pentagon, particularly from the ramp-up in production of Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which it contributes many components. Demand for many of its unmanned aircraft was also strong.Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive, said the effects of across-the-board sequestration cuts in defence spending had not yet made themselves felt.Caterpillar, meanwhile, continued to suffer from the slump in emerging markets’ once-booming mining industries. Operating profits in its resource industries division fell 61 per cent to $550m.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Not a recovery from where I’m sitting / From Mr William Dunkelberg
22;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-07-24T15:42:46Z;Biggest military contractors lift forecasts;Northrop and GD confirm defence industry strength;Northrop Grumman confirmed the robust health of the US’s biggest military contractors with better-than-expected net profits for the second quarter and a 10 per cent increase in its full-year earnings forecast.The lift in Northrop Grumman’s earnings guidance – from an earnings per share range of $6.85 to $7.15 to a $7.60 to $7.80 range – follows a smaller increase in full-year forecast reported on Tuesday by Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues.General Dynamics, the US’s fourth-biggest military supplier by revenues, reinforced the strong industry trend as it reported on Wednesday that second quarter net earnings were 1 per cent higher at $640m.The military suppliers are benefiting from the lag effect as the biggest, most complex military programmes continue to spend money allocated up to eight years ago, long before across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts started to take effect. Some may also be benefiting from the Pentagon’s apparent determination to safeguard some of the biggest, most strategically important military items from the cuts’ effects.Under the sequestration legislation – which was passed to end the 2011 stand-off over the US’s debt ceiling and came into force from March 1 this year – spending on nearly every US defence budget item is meant to be cut by 10 per cent.Northrop Grumman benefited particularly from strong demand for some unmanned systems – one of its specialities – and demand for Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which Northrop Grumman is a significant contributor. The two factors combined to push up the aerospace division’s operating income by 15 per cent to $336m, on sales which were up 8.7 per cent to $2.61bn.Net income at the electronic systems division rose 17 per cent to $322m on sales up 1.5 per cent to $1.77bn. The company attributed the growth to higher international sales and sales of sensing equipment and for space programmes.Northrop suffered the effects of sequestration in its information systems and technical services divisions. Such short-term businesses, which are funded from current year budgets, have been faster to experience sequestration’s effects than longer-term programmes. Information systems’ operating income fell 30 per cent to $141m, while technical services’ operating income fell 6.8 per cent to $69m.Wes Bush, chief executive, said Northrop would remain focused on maintaining its programmes’ performance and effective cash deployment.General Dynamics’ net income improved because of a 51 per cent increase to $389m in earnings in its aerospace division, which makes Gulfstream corporate jets. However, net income in its combat systems division, which mostly makes ground combat vehicles, fell 32 per cent to $218m.Northrop’s shares were up 3.8 per cent at lunchtime in New York, at $92.14, while GD’s were up 2.89 per cent at $86.46.
23;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-07-23T13:00:59Z;Defence contractors hopeful that big US programmes are safe;;"Contractors involved in some of the US military’s most sensitive and high-profile procurement projects are growing increasingly optimistic that some programmes could escape largely unscathed from sequestration spending cuts.The spared programmes would include those so complex, long-term or strategically important that it could prove nearly impossible to impose the spending cuts, introduced on March 1, meant to cut nearly every US defence budget item by around 10 per cent.Among the items that look likely to survive relatively unscathed are programmes to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding yard in Virginia, Boeing’s KC46A air tanker refuelling aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter.However, because many of the most complex items are paid for out of funds committed years in advance, it may take years for Defence Department policy in the area to become clear.Some further clarity may emerge this week when five big military contractors – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon – all report second-quarter figures.Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, said sequestration’s near-term impact on his business was “fairly neutral” – but he accepted programmes might later be delayed slightly.“The intermediate impact is scheduling of future programmes could start to be impacted,” he said. “I think aircraft carriers, submarines and destroyers are the priorities. Everything else is in the mix of, ‘What can we do for the money we have left?’”Mr Petters’ view echoes that expressed by Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chief executive, at a Deutsche Bank conference in June.She said that in a “budget-constrained environment” mature, established “programmes of record” – those already fully established and properly funded – tended to do better than “high-risk, developmental programmes”.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“So, to the extent that the department has some discretion in how they apply their reductions, you’re likely to see the programmes of record doing better and booking rates should be unaffected,” she said.Another figure in the sector pointed out that Pentagon officials had recently made supportive statements about the F35.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said it was “quite possibly true” that Huntington Ingalls’ key aircraft carrier and nuclear attack submarine programmes would largely escape cuts.Mr Thompson also predicted the F35, the DDG-51 destroyer, the air tanker and Boeing’s MV-22 Osprey rotorcraft would largely escape cuts, thanks to their strategic importance and the costs of modifying the programmes.Several defence contractors have already warned they expect sequestration to hit this year’s revenues at their services arms. Unlike long-term procurement programmes, for which funds are allocated years in advance, services tend to be paid for out of present-year budgets.Light armoured vehicles of the kind used heavily in Afghanistan are expected to become a far lower priority, following the US military drawdown there.F-35: Lockheed MartinThree branches of the US military – the marines, air force and navy – plan to buy some of the 2,443 F35s on order from Lockheed Martin, in a programme whose total cost is now expected to reach $1.5tn. The aircraft’s centrality to the US’s future defence plans, and the challenges in further adjusting it, are expected to leave it largely intact.KC-46A Tanker: BoeingThe tanker aircraft, being built by Boeing and based on its 767-200 commercial aircraft, is critical to replace the air force’s existing tanker fleet and preserve the reach of the air force’s other aircraft.Gerald Ford class aircraft carriers: Huntington IngallsIt takes around 11 years to build each $5bn aircraft carrier, from first steel-cutting to entry into service. US legislation also requires the navy have 11 operational at any one time, although only 10 are currently available. The carriers’ vital role in securing the US’s strategic position – and the complexity of altering the order – makes it likely the programme will survive with only some slowing.Virginia-class attack submarines: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe nuclear-powered attack submarines have a vital strategic role.DDG51 Destroyers: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe destroyers are expected to play a vital role in missile defence and other key strategic initiatives.MV22 Osprey rotorcraft: BoeingThe MV22 is considered vital to the marines’ ability to airlift troops over long distances. Equipped with two large rotors and wings, it operates like a helicopter when taking off or landing but swivels its rotors and converts itself into a faster, more fuel-efficient fixed-wing aircraft when travelling long distances.Programmes expected to sufferAbrams Tank: General DynamicsThe US Army, which is currently parking some tanks currently not needed, wants to stop production of the tank but has so far been ordered by Congress to keep building the vehicles.Bradley Fighting Vehicle: BAE SystemsThe programme is also threatened because of the number of vehicles already in service.Joint Light Tactical Vehicle: manufacturer not yet selectedThere has been speculation that the JLTV – intended to replace the Humvee as a battlefield vehicle – could be cancelled because of sequestration and the need to focus on other priorities."
24;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-07-23T12:36:53Z;Long-term work shields Newport News shipyard from US defence cuts;;"It is hard, when visiting the Newport News shipyard, in the Virginia town of the same name, to square the scene with the gloom widely predicted for military contractors following the start of deep, indiscriminate defence spending cuts earlier this year.The streets in the shipyard – so big it has its own railway, fire brigade and road names – teem with vehicles and workers going to and from the scores of buildings. The site, owned by Huntington Ingalls, remains Virginia’s biggest industrial employer, with 22,000 workers, well above its post cold war lows.But, from the office of Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, overlooking the yard, it becomes clear why the company and a handful of other key US military contractors are relatively unconcerned about the effects of sequestration, which mandates that nearly all US defence budget items must be cut by about 10 per cent.At one end of the yard, employees are still working on an aircraft carrier – the USS Gerald R Ford – on which work started in 2005. Further down, work is under way to “inactivate” the 52-year-old USS Enterprise, the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which needs its nuclear reactor and other sensitive equipment removed. Next to it, work is under way to overhaul and refuel the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier built in 1986.The long planning horizons for such work mean that Huntington Ingalls and a few other key companies on big, sophisticated, long-term projects are still working with money set aside by the US Congress as much as eight years ago.“It’s not a this year effect,” Mr Petters says of sequestration. “It’s not even a this year or next couple of years effect. It’s more of a medium to long-term effect.”However, the question that looms over Huntington Ingalls as surely as the vast crane over the Gerald Ford is whether the tougher budget environment will eventually catch up with its work. It remains unclear whether military services will seek to make cuts solely in less high-profile programmes and spare aircraft carriers and other key programmes – or cut 10 per cent from all procurement programmes across the board.“The question is, ‘How does the navy buy 90 per cent of a ship?’” Mr Petters says.Even before sequestration, spending was falling following the US’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, which many analysts expect to hit sales of some types of ground-fighting vehicles – a speciality of BAE Systems and General Dynamics. Some programmes might, however, be boosted by the US’s shift in strategic focus towards being able to fight a war in the Pacific, which is expected to ensure continued demand for the warships that Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works and others manufacture.All the decisions, meanwhile, are being taken against the background of continued political disagreements over budgets in Washington. Arrival at Newport News of the Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier due to undergo $2.6bn of refit and refuelling work, was delayed because of Congress’s initial failure to agree a federal budget for 2013, which meant the money for the project was at first unavailable.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“We did find ourselves in a predicament,” says Mr Petters, who adds that the stand-off was eventually resolved – and the vessel delivered – in time for the issue not to affect the shipyard’s revenue for the year.The key to understanding the future impact of the myriad budget changes under way is that sequestration – introduced in legislation that ended the crisis over the US’s debt ceiling – was intended to be so irrational that all involved would find an alternative means of putting the US’s public finances back into order.The Pentagon is consequently faced with trying to make rational procurement choices based on a law intended to be irrational.“There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty around US defence spending and the impacts of sequestration,” says Northrop Grumman, another significant contractor, which declines to speculate on how its programmes might be affected.Huntington Ingalls executives expect the Pentagon to protect the key programmes and relegate other equipment to what it calls “the scrum” of less strategically important equipment. Huntington Ingalls could suffer from cuts to programmes to build amphibious assault ships, which it makes at the second of its two shipyards in Mississippi. But continued protection for the most strategically sensitive ships would leave it in an unusually strong position compared with rivals.It is “quite possibly true” that the company will continue to evade serious cuts in its biggest programmes, says Loren Thompson, defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.“Huntington Ingalls is the only major defence contractor that’s currently talking about margin expansion,” he says.However, Mr Thompson predicts there will, if sequestration continues, eventually be slowdowns even to the highest-profile programmes. Mr Petters agrees there could be slippage.“Sequestration might cause a programme to move from 2014 to 2015 or 2015 to 2016,” Mr Petters says.For the moment, however, the flow of work for the yard looks likely to remain strong.Next to the Gerald Ford’s dry dock, cut steel and other early components for the USS John F Kennedy, its sister ship, lie waiting. Work on that vessel started, with congressional funding, in 2011, even though no formal contract has yet been signed. Once the contract is signed, Newport News workers are expected to be busy with that vessel until at least 2021."
25;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-06-28T13:10:52Z;Shale oil boom revives US shipyards;;Under the blazing sun of a hot Philadelphia day, Kristian Rokke, chief executive of Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, addresses a crowd of boiler-suited workers, telling them their yard is a rare bright spot for a troubled world shipbuilding industry.Mr Rokke tells the crowd – far bigger than it would have been just 18 months ago – that a big new expected order and strong interest in further contracts after that have transformed the yard from “surviving” to “thriving”. Behind them, the parts of one of two crude oil tankers being built for ExxonMobil, the oil major, are taking shape in one of the yard’s graving docks.The ExxonMobil vessels, four expected oil product tanker orders and two vessels that Aker Philadelphia sold earlier this year all testify to how the US’s oil production boom has transformed its once-moribund commercial shipbuilding industry.The boom has produced a similarly positive effect on the Californian coast, where General Dynamics’ Nassco, the only other big US shipyard with a strong record of building oil tankers, announced on May 31 that it had won its own order for four oil product tankers.The vessels are being built in the US to comply with the Jones Act, which requires any vessel operating between two US ports to be built in a US shipyard, fly the US flag and employ a US crew. The US industry’s revival comes as many shipyards elsewhere are struggling because of a worldwide oversupply of ships.Robert Kunkel, president of Alternative Marine Technologies, which supervises vessel construction in US shipyards, says the current Jones Act order surge is the biggest since Alaska started exporting oil to the rest of the US in 1977.“You’re getting Jones Act tonnage coming back into demand because of the energy independence movement,” he says.Mr Rokke mentions Nassco’s order in his speech to remind the workers that they face competition. But he also tells them how positive it is that US shipyards are capable of meeting the sudden strong growth in domestic US demand for tankers.“We have challenges in front of us,” Mr Rokke says. “But let’s not forget what a fantastic opportunity this domestic oil production represents.”Behind the Jones Act tanker boom lie many of the same factors that have turned the US’s railroads into significant transporters of crude oil. Some of the new centres of oil production – including North Dakota – are poorly connected to the US’s oil pipeline network or have only poor links to the eastern US refineries that can best use their oil. Tankers have increasingly been pressed into service to move crude oil along the Texas coast and north to the Philadelphia area. Ships are also increasingly moving refined oil from the Pacific North West to California.The boom has pushed up charter rates for the few Jones Act tankers not tied up on long-term contracts from $50,000 a day a year ago to around $80,000 a day currently. That has made it far more attractive to invest in new tankers from Jones Act yards such as Aker Philadelphia.“We see a significant increase in demand for product tankers,” Mr Rokke says. “I think we’re well positioned to build into that opportunity.”Aker – which is listed on the Oslo stock exchange and 71.2 per cent controlled by Norway’s Aker group of companies – has increased its workforce from 300 two years ago to 1,000.We see increased demand for quite some time. It’s exciting for us. It’s exciting for many other parts of the industry as wellAs recently as 2011, however, Aker Philadelphia was so short of work that managers constructed two product tankers on a speculative basis just to keep the yard ticking over. The yard was able to sell the vessels for $90m each, plus a share of the vessel’s future earnings, to Crowley Maritime, one of the biggest operators of Jones Act tankers, as the market picked up.“That worked very, very well for everybody,” Mr Rokke says of the Crowley deal.Mr Kunkel warns that, given the relatively small niche market for Jones Act tankers and the industry’s high costs, there is a risk that order numbers could fall off again as sharply as they have risen.“It has to be boom and bust, not actually a long-term situation,” Mr Kunkel says.However, Mr Rokke remains confident that a series of developments could keep his shipyard in “thriving” mode well into next decade. Potential customers are showing keen interest in the available building slots after the expected order for four product tankers, he says. Even after that, he says, there is the possibility of other new work. Among these might be supplying tankers to serve new oil installations further out in the Gulf of Mexico and renewing the ageing fleet of container ships that serves Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and other offshore US territories.“We see increased demand for quite some time,” Mr Rokke says. “It’s exciting for us. It’s exciting for many other parts of the industry as well.”
26;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-06-16T21:15:21Z;Commentary: Weapons makers focus on returns;If demand remains weak, they will begin exploring new combinations to strengthen financial results, says Loren Thompson;Washington’s budget debates are so complicated that even members of Congress have trouble keeping up with the state of play. But the fundamental reality for the defence industry is simply this: spending on military hardware and services is likely to continue falling, forcing some companies to leave the business or merge with competitors.The last time the defence sector faced such a swoon in demand – after the collapse of the Soviet Union – the purchasing power of the Pentagon’s procurement account fell by 60 per cent, while spending on personnel and operations declined much less. Despite all the talk of “across the board” cuts in defence spending, a similar pattern is likely this time.Look at the evidence. Only months after it took office in 2009, the Obama administration moved to kill a dozen large weapons programmes, including the air force’s F-22 fighter, the army’s planned family of networked combat vehicles and a missile defence cruiser for the navy. As the end of its first term neared, the administration conceded that most of the defence savings it had booked came from weapons accounts. No bases had been closed, no military benefits had been repealed.Contrary to popular myth, when peace looms at the Pentagon it is the weapons accounts that get cut first and furthest, because they have the least political protection.When Robert Gates, former defence secretary, proposed modest increases in the co-payments made by recipients of military healthcare, the whole political system was up in arms. When the centrepiece of army modernisation was killed, Congress barely noticed.Thus, sequestration – across the board cuts – may be a better outcome for the industry than what the political system would do in the absence of legislative mandates. With no urgent threats to focus the collective mind on consequences, and support for the two parties evenly divided in the electorate, the political impulse is to slash weapons spending while protecting people (namely, voters).The defence industry figured this out before Barack Obama took office, and has spent the better part of a decade preparing for hard times. That has had the paradoxical effect of bolstering company results in the near term, because costs were pared even as contracts signed in better times continued to generate cash. So the shares of many companies are trading at multiyear highs despite the softening in Pentagon demand.Big players such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems can probably sustain strong results for several more years by keeping programmes that remain on track and managing their finances. A favoured tactic is to buy back shares, which if done at a faster rate than revenues decline can raise earnings per share even in a weak-demand environment. Fifth-ranked Pentagon supplier Northrop Grumman plans to buy back a quarter of its shares over the next three years.Eventually, erosion at the top line will affect the bottom line, too, especially as the Pentagon is tightening up on terms and conditions for new contracts. Unless demand revives in response to a new threat, the defence industry will go through a consolidation wave, as seen in previous downturns.Consolidation has begun in the technical services segment, because contracts are renewed more often there. Therefore, the impact of softening demand is being felt sooner. Michael Lewis, analyst at the Virginia-based Silverline Group consultancy, believes big service players will first disassemble themselves, selectively spinning off properties, before consolidating in a handful of more resilient entities.On the hardware side, the biggest players are under little immediate pressure to make strategic moves, given their recent financial performance and share price appreciation. If demand remains weak, though, they will begin exploring new combinations to strengthen financial results.Warship and tank producer General Dynamics could prove to be an innovator in sector consolidation because the company has a history of making bold strategic moves. But in the near-term, the main weapons makers will focus on maintaining returns to shareholders. Lockheed Martin and Boeing believe there is plenty of untapped potential for overseas sales of their military aircraft, especially the fifth-generation F-35 fighter.——————————————-Loren Thompson is chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute think-tank and chief executive of the Source Associates consultancy.

27;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-06-10T11:44:24Z;Snowden highlights links between private sector and spies;;The National Security Agency’s sweeping surveillance of Americans’ telephone and internet usage is a stark reminder of just how privatised the core business of security and intelligence gathering has become.Edward Snowden, the 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA, worked as a contractor for Washington defence and technology consulting group Booz Allen Hamilton.Booz Allen, along with other defence companies such as General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin, have generated millions in revenues from cybersecurity and other intelligence contracts with the US government.The shift towards widescale outsourcing by government intelligence agencies soared after September 11 2001, as the US government rushed to boost security services.At the time, Bob Graham, then chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for “a symbiotic relationship between the intelligence community and the private sector”.In a short statement released over the weekend Booz Allen said: “News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm. We will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter.”Because budget figures are highly classified, it is unclear how many private contractors are employed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.According to The Washington Post’s Top Secret America series on the US intelligence industry published in 2011, a total of 265,000 of the 854,000 government workers with top-secret clearances worked for private organisations.Booz Allen, along with General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, have generated millions in revenues from cybersecurity contracts with the US government.According to Washington Technology, an information website, Booz Allen had contracts with the government that totalled $3.85bn in 2011. Dell had contracts that were worth $1.87bn in the same year. Respectively, the two companies ranked just eighth and 19th in that category.The links between the NSA and Booz Allen are deep. The vice-chairman of Booz Allen is Michael McConnell who headed the NSA from 1992 to 1996 and was Director of National Intelligence (DNI) from 2007 to 2009.James Clapper, the current director of national intelligence, is also a former Booz Allen executive.“The NSA is the only agency in the US with the legal authority, oversight and budget dedicated to breaking the codes and understanding the capabilities and intentions of potential enemies,” Mr McConnell wrote in the Washington Post in 2012.“The challenge is to shape an effective partnership with the private sector so information can move quickly back and forth from public to private – and classified to unclassified – to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure,” he added.
28;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Northrop Grumman maintains outlook amid US budget constraints;;Northrop Grumman is standing by its projections for 2013 earnings and sales despite delays in contract negotiations and uncertainty over future spending brought on by US government budget cuts.Wes Bush was speaking as Northrop, manufacturer of the B2 stealth bomber and other high-profile military hardware, announced first-quarter net earnings down 3.4 per cent to $489m compared with the same quarter last year, on sales down 1 per cent to $6.1bn.“All of this is creating a high degree of turmoil as our customers navigate these budget cross-currents,” Mr Bush said. “We share the concerns of the Pentagon leadership that damage to national security may be irreversible if sequestration is long-term.”Northrop Grumman is the Pentagon’s third-biggest supplier by sales, after Lockheed Martin and Boeing.General Dynamics, the fourth-biggest supplier, also stood by its projections for the year on Wednesday as it announced first-quarter net income up 1 per cent to $571m. However, it took significant write-offs in January partly as a result of the expected effect of military spending cuts on its business’s value.Both companies’ earnings highlighted how sequestration – which came into effect from March 1 – is having only a gradual impact on the US’s biggest military contractors. Most of the biggest military procurement programmes are paid for over several years from budgets allocated as much as five years before.Contractors are consequently expected to see the cuts’ results first in short-term contracts, such as those to supply information technology and other services, and to see the impact in items such as naval shipbuilding only in years to come.Northrop said it still expected 2013 earnings in a range between $6.85 and $7.15 per share and full-year sales about $24bn.Mr Bush said Northrop was taking a number of steps to withstand the effects of sequestration, including setting up “centres of excellence” in key areas such as manned and unmanned aviation. These would enable the company to retain expertise in key areas even as it reorganised manufacturing.Segment operating income at Northrop’s information systems division showed the biggest falls against last year’s first quarter, declining 17 per cent to $171m, on sales down 9 per cent to $1.67bn. Segment operating income at technical services fell 7 per cent to $65m, on sales down 4 per cent to $717m.Operating income in information systems fell 3 per cent to $296m, on flat sales of $1.72bn, while segment operating income in the core aerospace business fell 3 per cent to $270m, on sales up 4 per cent to $2.48bn. Aerospace volumes benefited from higher deliveries of the F35 joint strike fighter, to which Northrop Grumman contributes.The two big contractors issued their figures a day after Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, said it expected sequestration – which reduced nearly all Pentagon budgets by 9 per cent – to cut its sales this year by $825m.Northrop shares closed up 3.2 per cent to $73.77, while General Dynamics was up 6.9 per cent to $71.73.
29;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-04-14T21:54:46Z;General Dynamics to cut UK workforceCOOP. PLS DELAY WEB PUBLISHING;;General Dynamics UK is to cut more than 10 per cent of its workforce and restructure its business in the latest sign of Britain’s shrinking defence industry.Britain’s third-largest defence prime contractor by sales, which employs 1,600 people in the UK, has called for 185 voluntary redundancies. It has warned that it will have to move to forced redundancies if it falls short.The business is a subsidiary of General Dynamics, the fourth-largest US defence contractor by sales. It has a more than £1bn contract to develop the latest armoured reconnaissance vehicle for the UK army.The latest move is designed to restructure the way its UK business is run after last month’s retirement of Sandy Wilson, its president and managing director, and the subsequent departure of Mark Douglas, who led its strategic planning and business development.The restructuring suggests GD UK is taking an increasingly bleak view of the future of the UK market, defence analysts and one executive at another contractor said. Despite opposition from the UK’s ministry of defence and senior politicians, many in the industry expect the UK’s austerity drive to prompt further cuts to its defence budget.GD UK’s shift is particularly significant because it has been the most aggressive among its peers in marketing itself as a UK company, not simply a UK subsidiary of a US defence contractor. For example, its executives frequently stress that, unlike others, GD UK has its own profit and loss centre, and turns over $1bn a year.“Investment from US defence contractors in the UK has been instrumental in success of the UK defence industry in the past 20 years,” said Howard Wheeldon, an independent sector analyst.“The pressure on prime US defence contractors operating in the UK is going to get a lot worse because of the cuts. They can’t stand by unless they have got orders in the book,” he added, noting that the UK economy was not losing jobs but also the skills needed to produce defence equipment.Mr Wilson’s replacement, Steve Rowbotham, has been given the title of chief operating officer of General Dynamics UK and will have different reporting lines into the US than his predecessor.The company’s reorganisation shifts its focus from a geographic one to one based on product lines. Mr Rowbotham will report to GD’s C4 Systems and its Land Systems group, both based in the US, while the heads of those business units have been added to GD UK’s board.“As any good business does, we continually look at our markets to determine the best way to support our customers, and as part of the restructuring at General Dynamics UK we have more closely aligned the business with other parts of General Dynamics,” a company spokesman said, confirming the voluntary redundancy programme.“This new alignment provides access to additional engineering and manufacturing expertise and lines of products, enabling us to strengthen and expand our offerings to our UK customers and globally.”
30;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-03-01T20:51:21Z;US sequestration: drama, comedy, horror;A collective case of shock fatigue suggests we have reached mid-series malaise;Think of recent US fiscal policy as a film franchise – part drama, part comedy, part horror. The opening instalment was the summer 2011 blockbuster, Debt Ceiling. The downgrade of US debt after the default brinkmanship made our jaws drop, but was followed by a clever plot twist: Treasuries rallied to all-time lows. And the brilliant producers, President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, planted the seeds for a string of sequels. The winter showdown, Fiscal Cliff, ended with a feel-good (if temporary) holiday compromise.But with Friday’s release of Sequestration, featuring $85bn in automatic spending cuts slated for 2013 (the first of $1.2tn over a decade), we have reached mid-series malaise. The collective yawn from all involved indicate that this edition is one big plot hole. Mr Obama has hit the talk show circuit to vainly stoke up fervour among ordinary Americans. However his golf vacation, along with meaningless negotiations with Republicans, betray that Washington is resting up for its next project.What movie is the market watching instead? The reliable if dry Earnings Season is playing alongside the remake of Merger Mania (not as thrilling as the 2007 version) and with this double feature, the Dow is closing in on its all-time high of 14,164.That said, the defence names are indeed hitting the theatres for Sequestration. Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin are down as much as 5 per cent this year. The smaller defence companies that are more geared towards services could be harder hit. The government and military consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton is down nearly a tenth.The next contribution, Government Shutdown (an homage to the 1996 classic starring Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich) is only weeks away as Uncle Sam needs to fund its future operations. And Debt Ceiling III: Dirty Barry is slated for this summer, though these next two could mercifully be wrapped into one grand (bargain) finale.Movies are, ultimately, an escape. The reality remains weak gross domestic product growth and 8 per cent unemployment. And it may be a fantasy to think Washington could star in a movie about fixing that.
31;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-01-24T23:36:48Z;Lockheed Martin goes on defence;Military supplier will need mission to prove its own belt tightening;Sequestration, shmequestration. Lockheed Martin on Thursday gave its forecasts for 2013. The biggest single supplier to the US defence department gave projections on the assumption that across-the-board cuts in federal spending will not happen. As part of the early 2013 deal to avert the fiscal cliff, lawmakers delayed this so-called sequestration. But unless the warring factions of Congress compromise on a budget, the automatic belt-tightening will hit in early March.Should Lockheed have laid out the disaster scenario, as well? That could have just spooked investors when neither they, nor Lockheed, nor indeed Congress itself is in a good position to estimate the probability of a deal – or to know precisely where cuts would come within the military budget.More importantly, cuts at the Pentagon are likely to show through in their suppliers’ accounts only gradually. A fighter jet is not built in a day, and some appropriations are done years in advance. The exception is information technology – computing, biometrics and cyber security – which has a shorter cycle.Military contractor General Dynamics, for example, on Wednesday announced a big writedown on acquisitions in the company’s IT group, based on lower defence spending. At Lockheed, the information systems segment accounts for about a fifth of sales, and revenues in the segment fell in 2012, while sales in every other segment rose or held steady.Whether Congress makes peace or not, defence spending, like all spending, is going to be under pressure. Even without the sequestration, Lockheed predicted that revenue would drop as much as 6 per cent in 2013, following a 1.5 per cent increase in 2012. If Lockheed is to grow its profits, it will have to prove its own belt tightening will proceed at a faster pace than the government’s.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
32;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-01-24T12:28:56Z;Lockheed plays down budget talks impact;;Two of the biggest suppliers to the US defence department – Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – on Thursday issued forecasts for the coming year that assume no drastic, across-the-board spending cuts, in a sign of some contractors’ continuing optimism.Lockheed, the main contractor for the F-35 joint strike fighter and C-130 transport aircraft, estimated that diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations would be between $8.80 and $9.10. The figure was sharply up from the $8.36 per share that the company reported on Thursday for 2012 and the $7.81 it achieved for 2011.Raytheon, which specialises in missile and space systems, said it expected adjusted EPS – a measure that excludes some pension effects and debt retirement – down to a range of $5.65 to $5.80, compared with $6.21 for 2012. The company announced fourth quarter net income down 14 per cent to $469m, on revenue up 1 per cent to $1.89bn.Both companies’ optimism reflects the conviction of many of the largest US-based defence contractors that they will feel relatively little of the effect of the US budget crisis, even though current legislation calls for sweeping automatic cuts in budgets. Both based their forecasts on the assumption that mandated, across-the-board cuts in all US defence budgets – known as sequestration – would not occur.They announced their forecasts a day after General Dynamics, the US’s fourth-biggest military contractor by revenues, announced $2.3bn in impairment charges for the fourth quarter, mostly related to slowing US defence spending.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed Martin’s chief financial officer, said it was unclear how sequestration cuts would be implemented if the measure were not averted. Current legislation calls for across-the-board cuts of about 10 per cent to all programmes equally – but politicians could agree to target the cuts on the most easily cancelled programmes.The choices that Congress will face and the arguments for and against cutting different areas of the defence budget“Under a sequestration where it is more targeted, we would fare better because the products we make are more closely aligned with the national security of this country,” Mr Tanner said.Lockheed Martin’s net income for the fourth quarter fell 17 per cent to $569m, on net sales down 1 per cent to $12.1bn. Net income for the year rose 3.4 per cent to $2.74bn, on sales up 1.5 per cent to $47.2bn.Lockheed nevertheless sounded gloomy about the prospects for its information systems and global solutions business, which it said suffered a 14 per cent fall in net sales, to $2.2bn, and a 20 per cent fall in operating profits to $203m. The division operates in similar segments to General Dynamics’ Information Systems and Technology Group, whose acquired goodwill General Dynamics wrote down by $1.99bn in value on Wednesday.Lockheed’s shares fell nearly 3 per cent to close at $93.25, while Raytheon’s fell 2.85 per cent to $56.54.

Shares rallied in after-hours trading and rose again on Wednesday, closing up 4.4 per cent to $204.72.Better than expected results from both companies, as well as gains in Apple, scheduled to report results after market close, lifted the S&P 500 information technology sector, which was up more than 1 per cent by midday, even though broader markets were mixed.Apple shares closed 1.9 per cent higher at $514.17 ahead of the most anticipated earnings release.After the market close, the iPhone and iPad maker announced $13.81 in earnings per share, slightly above estimates, however it missed expectations on revenues due to lower iPhone sales. The stock lost more than 5 per cent in extended trading following the announcement.The benchmark S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory, however, the index finished the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,494.78, hitting a fresh five-year high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent higher at 13,779.17. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 3,153.67.A research note from Bespoke Investment Group said more than three quarters of stocks on the S&P 500 index were overbought – trading above their 50-day moving average. The research says such overconfidence often leads to a sharp drop weeks and months after.“Markets are waiting for more substantive news from the Congress on the fate of the debt ceiling,” said Jeremy Zirin, chief equities strategist at UBS Wealth Management.Commenting on the technology sector he struck an optimistic tone: “Valuations are at a two decade low and trading at an 8 per cent discount to the benchmark. Among the S&P 500 sectors, we expect the tech sector to have the strongest returns in 2013.”Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds, while optimistic about equities in general, cautions that national equity markets are misleading.“Investors should look at companies not from the point of view of the geography of their headquarters but their operations – where their revenues are coming from and where are their largest costs.”“While we see a broad-based rally, as fundamentals and the global economy improve, we will see that markets will get selective,” he added.In earnings news, McDonald’s shares were higher after the world’s largest fast-food chain restaurant by sales modestly beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations.The company struggled in 2012 with disappointing sales and declining profits during the global slowdown and competition from the likes of Yum Brands and Wendy’s. Its share price lost 12.1 per cent last year, making it among the worst hit Dow components.On Wednesday, McDonald’s shares added 0.6 per cent to $93.48.General Dynamics shares fell after the defence contractor reported an annual loss following an impairment charge in the fourth quarter due to a decline in government spending in the US and overseas. The stock dropped 1 per cent to $71.45.United Technologies, diversified industrial group, reported that fourth-quarter profit jumped 55 per cent to $2.06bn. Shares were 0.7 per cent higher at $88.07.In other earnings news, AMD shares added 11.4 per cent to $2.73 after the semiconductor company reported higher profits than expected by analysts.In contrast, Coach shares shed 16.4 per cent to $50.75 after quarterly earnings missed analysts’ expectations.

35;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Defence cuts cause General Dynamics loss;;General Dynamics on Wednesday became the first big US military contractor to take a significant writedown for declining US defence spending when it announced a $2.13bn fourth-quarter loss at the start of its “reset year”.The loss stemmed from $2.3bn in impairment charges, mostly a $1.99bn writedown of goodwill associated with past acquisitions in the company’s Information Systems and Technology Group. The company also wrote down $191m in intangible assets in its aerospace group and $110m in intangible assets in IS&T.The IS&T division provides services to the military on shorter lead times, where budget cuts are likely to be felt more quickly. The write-offs in the aerospace group reflect softening European demand for the company’s Gulfstream corporate jets.Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s biggest single supplier, and Raytheon, another significant supplier, both report results on Thursday.General Dynamics’ results were the first since Phebe Novakovic took over from Jay Johnson as chief executive on January 1.US military contractors had been facing across-the-board cuts of around 10 per cent to all military programmes under the “fiscal cliff” mixture of tax rises and spending cuts, which was temporarily averted at the start of the year. However, Ms Novakovic told investors on a conference call that 2013 would still be General Dynamics’ “reset year”.“I’m going be pretty conservative here,” she said. “I think that’s prudent. We’ve got potential budget cuts coming our way.”Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the charges reflected Ms Novakovic’s determination to put the company’s finances on a “more realistic footing”.“This is Phebe Novakovic’s first earnings call and she’s offering a conservative, even sombre, assessment,” Mr Thompson said.The fourth-quarter loss compared with $603m net profit in 2011’s last quarter, and was struck on net sales down 12 per cent to $8.08bn.As well as expected declines in the US, General Dynamics warned about the potential effects of slowing European defence spending. It took a $292m charge relating to contract disputes in its European land vehicles business.General Dynamics’ net loss for 2012 was $332m, against $2.55bn net profit for 2011, on revenue down 3.6 per cent to $31.5bn. The company lost 94 cents per diluted share, against $6.87 profit per share for 2011. The company forecast earnings of $6.60 to $6.70 per share for 2013.General Dynamics’ shares fell 4.84 per cent to $67.29.
36;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-01-15T18:52:53Z;Record subscription bookings for Wandisco;;Wandisco, the AIM-listed software company, has reported record subscription numbers for the fourth quarter, building on the success of its IPO last year.The company reported subscription bookings of $2.5m, an increase of 76 per cent from the same quarter last year, and a new record for the company.Total bookings for 2012 were $7.9m, an increase of 71 per cent from 2011, and renewals of existing subscriptions also stayed healthy.The company said it had gained Apple, Fujitsu, Cap Gemini and General Dynamics as new customers during the fourth quarter. The company also made deals with H3C and Nanjing Exchange in China, where it recently set up an office.Bookings and subscription renewals are important performance gauges for Wandisco’s business.“It’s really a reflection on the sales talent that they have been hiring, which doesn’t get the same air time as the engineers,” said George O’Connor, an analyst at Panmure Gordon.Wandisco’s software allows companies to synchronise the computer programs and documents emp­loyees use in different locations. The company was one of only three tech companies to list in the UK last year.In November, Wandisco paid £3.2m for AltoStor, a deal that marked the company’s move into so-called big data solutions. That market is expected to grow from $5bn currently, to $50bn in the next five years.Altostor’s founders, Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, were important contributors to Apache Hadoop, the open-source software used by companies such as Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and eBay to manage and move vast stores of data.Speaking to the Financial Times this month, Wandisco chief executive David Richards said the company would combine Hadoop technology with Wandisco’s program and data synchronisation to help companies keep corporate data backed up and constantly available.The company expects to start selling its first big data products within three months.The markets showed little reaction to the latest numbers. Shares in Wandisco fell 1.3 per cent to close at 577p.Mr O’Connor said investors were now awaiting the company’s entry into the big data market.“What the market is really excited about with this is the opportunity to gain investment exposure to the next big thing in the tech marketplace,” said Mr O’Connor. “Given that the main drivers are the big data products, investors will pause for breath now.”
37;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2013-01-03T17:30:16Z;The women piloting an industry;Several US defence companies have appointed female leaders;"For a few days now, three of the US’s six biggest defence companies have had women at the helm. Both Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin, the country’s biggest defence contractor by revenue, and Phebe Novakovic at General Dynamics, its fourth largest defence supplier, took on the chief executive role at their respective companies on January 1. In doing so, they are following in the footsteps of Linda Hudson, who was the US defence sector’s first female chief in 2009 when she became head of BAE Inc, US subsidiary of the UK defence group.But that is not all. In an industry where senior management teams have traditionally been led by men, women are also filling many positions just below the rank of CEO. When Boeing Defence late last year reshuffled its executive ranks and created seven new leadership roles, five were filled by women; six of the 14 members of Northrop Grumman’s senior management team are women. Back at Lockheed Martin, three of seven of the top leadership roles are held by women.Some observers believe the impact could be significant: “If there’s only 10 per cent of women in your executive ranks they tend to echo the opinion of the majority. Once that gets up to 30 per cent or more they are very much able to voice a wider set of goals and ambitions in the workplace,” says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of think-tank the Cen­ter for Talent Innovation.Loren Thompson, defence analyst and chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, another think-tank, says the US defence industry is in the middle of “a revolutionary demogra­phic shift that may soon make women the dominant gender among senior executives”. But Mr Thompson does not expect it to initiate any significant change: “To be successful in the defence industry, women must conform with the same numbers-driven performance criteria that men face.”The appointments come at a time when defence companies are being forced to change how they operate as deep budget cuts and stringent new contract terms take effect.Ms Hewson attributes her success to a willingness to take risks and remain open to new ideas. Mr Thompson notes in particular that her humility will serve her well in mending Lockheed’s relationship with its biggest customer, the Pentagon – which analysts who cover the company say is a top priority. Relations became strained after delays and cost overruns at Lockheed’s Joint Strike Fighter programme, the most expensive military procurement proj­ect ever.Her appointment late last year was a surprise – even to her. It came after the heir-apparent resigned because of an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.The National Science Foundation, an independent US government agency responsible for promoting science and engineering through res­earch programmes and education projects, notes that the momentum in recruiting more women has stalled and some of the gains even reversed.One reason may be that a growing number of potential leaders are balking at the sacrifice their predecessors made, as Anne-Marie Slaughter noted in an article for The Atlantic magazine entitled: “Why Women Still Can’t Have it All.” She explained her decision to give up a high-powered position in the US State Department to spend more time with her children. Ms Hewson has moved her family eight times during her career.A second threat to whether the emergence of more female leaders in defence will be judged a success in years to come may arise precisely from the challenges that made their elevation possible. Michelle Ryan and Alex Has­lam, professors at Exeter University, studied the UK’s biggest 100 listed companies in 2004, and concluded that women are more like­ly to be appointed to leadership positions that are associated with an inc­reased risk of criticism and failure.The situation could hardly be more precarious for the women newly in leadership positions in defence companies. Congress this week managed to avoid the feared $500bn automatic defence and security spending cuts that would have gone into effect at midnight on January 1 – Ms Hewson and Ms Novakovic’s first day as CEOs – had they failed to agree a last-minute fiscal budget deal. But many defence experts and executives believe the pain has merely been delayed and that deep cuts remain on the horizon given the US’s high debt and the large proportion of defence spending within the US’s discretionary budget. Some predict total US spending on defence procurement and research and development – the sections of the budget most pertinent to the big military contractors – to fall by as much as 40-50 per cent from their peak during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.As Robert Stevens, Lockheed’s former chief, and his peers ease into retirement, the new leaner reality presents the single biggest challenge to those who are getting their first chance to lead."
38;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-12-22T00:06:36Z;Defence cuts likely to hurt service providers;;The effect of defence spending reductions under the fiscal cliff package of cuts would fall more quickly on providers of services to the Pentagon than on weapons makers, analysts have said.Any cuts for big weapons makers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman would probably be only about 2-3 per cent next year, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defence analyst.However, companies that offer day-to-day services to the Pentagon such as data processing would be more likely to see more immediate cuts, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute.The men spoke as the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbyist for military contractors, called for defence spending to be split from negotiations over the fiscal cliff mixture of tax increases and spending cuts that are set to come in on January 1.The Pentagon’s budget accounts for about half of the government’s discretionary expenditure – spending that is not mandated under fixed government programmes. As a result, defence budgets are set to fall 9.1 per cent next year, across all programmes, if the automatic spending cuts come into force.The complexities of the Pentagon’s $550bn annual budget mean that different programmes would be affected differently. The main division is between companies whose earnings come from Pentagon procurement budgets and those paid from short-term operational budgets. Procurement budgets set up for individual programmes tend to be set up to disburse funds over three years as weapons are ordered and manufactured.As a result, programmes such as Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter are likely to feel the effect of the sequestration cuts only after three years, according to Mr McAleese.For naval shipbuilding, each procurement budget can be spent over as long as five years. That had “major application” for General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, two of the biggest operators of naval shipyards, Mr McAleese said.“It will be 2015 before they actually begin to feel the effects of a sequester,” Mr McAleese said.However, companies paid from “short-cycle budgets” – such as CACI, the information technology provider based in Virginia – would feel the cuts far more quickly. “Companies providing services such as data processing, logistics and accounting will feel a significant impact in the first year,” he said.The only operational budgets exempt from the sequestration cuts would be those that pay for continuing deployments such as in Afghanistan.Despite the exemption, Marion Blakey, chief executive of the AIA, attacked plans to implement the sequestering of defence spending.“Risking American lives and livelihoods for political leverage is wrong,” she said.She demanded that defence spending be decoupled from the other tax and spending issues under negotiation between the two political sides.“The victims of this political gamesmanship will be the warfighters who risk their lives to protect our country and the American workers who will start losing their jobs when this game implodes on January 2, 2013,” Ms Blakey said.
39;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Debt issuance rebounds in wake of Sandy;;US debt capital markets returned to life with a bang with companies rushing to issue deals after a shutdown in the wake of hurricane Sandy.A slew of companies including the finance arms for Caterpillar and BP, Stanley Black & Decker, the provider of hand tools, General Dynamics, a defence contractor and Capital One Financial sold about $11bn combined in new bonds.The rebound came after no new corporate debt deals were offered in the US market this week, according to data provider Dealogic. The bond market was officially closed on Tuesday.Corporate borrowers also rushed to sell the bonds ahead of market-moving events that could trigger volatility and push borrowing costs higher.US companies have timed new deals opportunistically throughout year, seeking to avoid rapid turnround in markets. Thursday’s “window of opportunity” comes as the Bureau of Labour Statistics said it would proceed with the release of the critical US non-farm payrolls data on Friday – the last of the big economic news before the US presidential election on Tuesday.“The new issue market has come back with a vengeance today as investors were again operational post Sandy and had substantial cash to put to work,” said Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital markets at Barclays.He added that volumes were expected to remain high in November with “some issuers looking to get ahead of that supply, while others are conscious of taking any risk associated with the election off the table”.Thursday’s sales will push the total for US debt issuance over the $1.15tn mark so far this year, the busiest on record for dollar-debt sales, according to Dealogic. The new sales are set to meet strong demand.Investors have favoured corporate bonds as returns have outpaced that of government securities this year.On average, US corporate bonds have returned 10 per cent year-to-date compared with 1.9 per cent for US Treasuries and a 13.1 per cent return for high-yield corporate debt, according to Barclays indices.John Higgins, senior market economist at Capital Economics, said a rally in corporate bonds was beginning to show signs of running out of steam. But corporate debt may continue to benefit from an extended period of potentially open-ended quantitative easing.“In the absence of another recession, such as the one which hit the US in 1937-38 a few years after the Great Depression, a major spike in spreads and yields seems unlikely,” he said.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
40;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-10-24T17:45:33Z;Defence contractors face budget fears;;Two of the US’s biggest military contractors raised their full-year guidance as they predicted strong ends to the year, despite the looming threat of across-the-board defence budget cuts in January.Lockheed Martin, maker of the F35 and other combat aircraft, said it expected earnings per share from continuing operations for the current year of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, from $7.90 to $8.10 previously. Northrop Grumman, maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber, upgraded its earnings estimate from $7.05 to $7.25 a share to between $7.35 and $7.40.The upgrades came after both companies announced third-quarter profits significantly better than analysts’ expectations.Lockheed’s net earnings improved to $727m, from $700m for the same period last year including $35m from discontinued operations, on a 2 per cent decline in net sales to $11.9bn. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to $2.21.Northrop Grumman’s net earnings fell 12 per cent to $459m, on revenue down 5 per cent to $6.27bn. Earnings per share fell 4 per cent to $1.82.However, General Dynamics, which makes warships, military vehicles and corporate jets, fell short of analysts’ expectations, producing net earnings down 8 per cent to $600m, on revenue up 1 per cent to $7.93bn. On a per-share basis, earnings fell 5.5 per cent to $1.71.Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin chief executive, said the “strong operating results“ were a reflection of several factors, including its focus on affordability and programme execution.“We also have a strategy that is aligned with our customers, a proven portfolio of products and technologies, and a team that is talented and dedicated, even with the uncertainties that lie ahead,” he said.Wes Bush, Northrop Grumman chief executive, attributed the results to his company’s focus on “performance, effective cash deployment, and portfolio alignment”.However, all US military contractors face the risk that the programme of across-the-board cuts– knows as “sequestration” – could cut nearly every part of the military budget by about 10 per cent in the new year.They also face the possibility that even if politicians agree an alternative to sequestration, there would still be severe spending cuts. Lockheed Martin said its sales would decline next year even without sequestration.Mr Stevens said the company had been very clear for a long period of time about its concerns over the possibility of sequestration.“It’s really not an effective way to reduce spending, particularly when it will not align with the strategy and commitments that our country has made,” he said.Lockheed Martin based its projections for next year on President Barack Obama’s defence plan for the second half of the 2013 fiscal year, and on the assumption that sequestration would be avoided. Under that assumption, the company said its net sales would fall next year in the “low single-digits”.Mr Bush said Northrop Grumman was working closely with its customers to bring innovative, affordable solutions to support their needs in “today’s fiscally constrained environment”.
41;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US attitude to contractor mergers unclear;;The collapse of merger talks between EADS and the UK’s BAE Systems has left a significant question hanging not only unanswered but unasked: namely what would be the attitude of the US Department of Defense to mergers between its suppliers?Following the abandonment of EADS’s tie-up with BAE, the sixth-biggest US military contractor by annual revenues, US defence companies still do not know whether falling defence spending has made the Pentagon relax its opposition to further consolidation among its big suppliers.After the end of the cold war some US industrial companies – such as Chrysler, General Motors and Ford decided to spin out or sell off military subsidiaries as defence spending fell. The Pentagon then encouraged a wave of consolidation in the 1990s: Northrop and Grumman merged in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin and Boeing in 1997 took over McDonnell Douglas.Some similar fragmentation has already taken place during this defence slowdown: Northrop Grumman spun out its shipbuilding operations in March last year, for example, while SAIC, a provider of sophisticated professional services to the military, decided in August to split itself in two. However, so far the Pentagon has said it is reluctant to see mergers of big suppliers – but stressed it would still treat each deal on a case-by-case basis.“The reality of those kinds of policy pronouncements is that they can always change,” says Pierre Chao, managing partner of Renaissance Strategic Advisors. “In some ways, they’re also administration personality-specific.”Behind much of the current confusion about the industry’s future shape lies uncertainty about the Department of Defense’s budget. Military programmes could face 9.4 per cent across-the-board cuts from January if legislators are unable to agree before then on an alternative programme to close the US budget deficit.Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, one of the top five suppliers, said last month that such cuts could prompt the Pentagon to reassess its opposition to mergers among its biggest suppliers.There has been speculation that, in such a scenario, Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft maker, and General Dynamics, the armoured vehicle maker, might team up to take over BAE together. However, people familiar with the thinking of the two companies – both of which are in the midst of leadership changes – pour cold water on the suggestions.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says that while the Pentagon and other regulators encouraged the mergers that gave the industry its current shape, the mood now is very different.“The policy makers at the Pentagon now believe that there was too much concentration back then,” Mr Thompson says. “So they’re not going to permit major combinations.”That means, Mr Thompson and Mr Chao suggest, that corporate activity among military contractors in the foreseeable future is likely to consist mainly of groupings amid smaller operations. Following the collapse of the planned BAE-EADS merger, there is very little to prompt other big contractors into action, says Mr Thompson. “They’re waiting to see who wins the White House,” he says.
42;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-10-10T19:16:37Z;BAE left to take care of deal fallout;;"For BAE Systems and its management, the only development more dramatic than their proposed €36bn union with EADS may turn out to be the deal’s failure.Many analysts and industry executives believe BAE is not only out of good options but that its attempt to tie up with EADS has left it dangerously exposed and facing the wrath of its investors – and its most important customer, the US.Ian King and Dick Olver, respectively BAE’s chief executive and its chairman, have also been tarnished because of their inability to persuade even BAE’s most loyal shareholders of the wisdom of the deal. Many investors and analysts now believe both men’s jobs are on the line.For BAE, the future looks dimmer than it did before news of the proposed deal surfaced.“We think that BAE’s willingness to do such a deal now implies a lower degree of confidence in the company’s ability to achieve all of its large export opportunities in the reasonable timeframe expected by many investors,” says Sash Tusa at Echelon, the independent analyst.Mr Olver on Wednesday insisted there was no reason to change BAE’s management team, and investors are unlikely to want to further destabilise the company by pushing too quickly for a change of leadership.But investors have already called for a review of BAE’s strategy – a move Mr King says is not necessary.“What’s next is Plan A, that we deliver on our strategy that we articulated before,” Mr King told the Financial Times on Wednesday, disputing any need to change tack.Many analysts and investors believe BAE might now just have to ride out alone the storm of the economic downturn, the end of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the cuts in US and European defence spending.The most extreme change in strategy could involve the company being broken up into pieces; its important US arm, source of 43 per cent of its revenue, being spun off or sold; and the rest of the company – businesses in the UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia – left to limp along.The emergence of a new suitor for BAE from among the big US defence companies is another possibility some have noted, arguing that the deal’s collapse leaves BAE vulnerable.One senior UK official said BAE would remain “in play”, noting: “The risk for BAE is it has made clear that it does not have a long-term future without some kind of tie-up.”Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are said to have already approached the Pentagon to see whether such a proposal would be acceptable. Few people who have closely followed the defence industry believe it would be. The US defence department’s long-held view has been that the number of its biggest suppliers has shrunk enough after the consolidation of the late 1990s that created Lockheed and Boeing, the country’s largest defence contractors.A person close to Lockheed on Wednesday said it would not be interested in bidding for BAE. “We’re looking at focusing on our customers and our cost-reduction issues,” he said.The US government’s opposition to further consolidation in the US defence market may have eased somewhat as spending cuts have prompted companies to begin lay-offs, but BAE’s size – it is the world’s second largest defence company after Lockheed and a top 10 supplier to the US government – remains an insurmountable hurdle, say analysts.“The Pentagon has warned against consolidation and we would not expect a potential bid from any other US competitors,” says Ed Salvesen, analyst at Brewin Dolphin Investment Management.The UK government is also unlikely to sanction such a deal because a US owner would not guarantee that some of BAE’s most sensitive UK projects – such as nuclear submarine building – would remain in the UK. Bankers say they have for years tried to make a transatlantic union work and BAE has looked at, and dismissed, a tie-up with Boeing and, more recently, with Northrop Grumman.Mr King says he does not expect another suitor and that none has so far approached him. But people close to the deal say EADS could spend the next three months – with the blessing of BAE – lobbying the German government and then have another go at BAE early next year, especially given that most of the non-political details of the deal have already been agreed.For now Mr King will have to articulate a convincing strategy to his customers – particularly the US and UK governments – and his investors.“They will be under enormous pressure to explain what Plan B is and they’ll be punished if they don’t,” says Guy Anderson of IHS Jane’s, the defence industry analysts.Many fellow industry executives and analysts sympathetically note that decisions made by Mike Turner, Mr King’s predecessor, meant that the BAE chief “found himself completely exposed to two defence markets [the US and UK] just before they went belly up,” as Mr Anderson puts it.They argue BAE does not need to throw in the towel at what may be the bottom of the defence cycle, nor that its future without a deal looks as grim as Mr Turner and others have argued.Even BAE’s closest competitors envy its broad international portfolio, its ability to generate cash and a loyal following of investors drawn to the steady dividend.For all the criticism of BAE that the EADS deal has unleashed, many investors, industry executives and analysts believe that, rather than a dramatic change in direction, the company needs a management that is better at articulating its strategy.Additional reporting by Robert Wright and Anousha Sakoui"
43;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-10-10T18:32:36Z;Fears of healthcare cuts weigh on S&N;;Smith & Nephew was out of favour on Wednesday on fears that austerity budgets were putting more pressure on healthcare spending.Rival orthopaedics maker Biomet said overnight that sales of hip and knee implants had slowed sharply in the quarter ending August. The US group, which had been gaining market share following product launches, said it did not know whether the slowdown was company-specific or sectorwide.Analysts noted that Biomet’s US sales growth had unexpectedly stalled. A resilient US market had been expected to compensate for budget cuts in Europe, which provides a third of S&N’s sales.S&N, which was trading ex-interim dividend, closed 2.6 per cent lower at 655p. “Sell” advice from Société Générale also weighed against the stock.With S&N finance officer Adrian Hennah due to leave at the end of the year, any decision on acquisitions or a share buyback was likely to be pushed back to 2014, SocGen said.The broker also dismissed persistent speculation that S&N could be a bid target.Competition hurdles ruled out Johnson & Johnson, as it would have to sell too much of S&N’s business, while Medtronic would not be able to extract enough cost savings, SocGen said. It also reckoned Biomet’s private equity owners could not afford S&N, and that shareholders would not back a bid in the opposite direction given S&N management’s poor acquisition record.The wider market drifted lower for a third straight day, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.6 per cent or 33.54 points at 5776.71.Aggreko slid 1.3 per cent to £22.11 after the second profit warning in as many quarters from US engine maker Cummins, one of its biggest suppliers. Cummins cited weak international power generation markets, as well as poor sales in China and disappointing North American heavy duty truck demand.The warning also hit engineers, with GKN down 0.5 per cent at 214.1p, Bodycote sliding 3.1 per cent to 372.9p and IMI down 2.5 per cent to 920p.Croda slipped 2.3 per cent to £22.21 after EMS-Chemie, the polymer maker, talked of a “clear downturn” in demand in all its markets.Cautious guidance from Alcoa weighed against the miners, with Vedanta Resources sliding 2.8 per cent to £10.60. Iron ore pellet maker Ferrexpo slid 4.7 per cent to 193.1p even after an in-line quarterly production report.Talvivaara lost 3.8 per cent to 151.2p, with Goldman Sachs cutting its target to 158p in a note that was critical of the nickel miner’s quality of assets.Banks outperformed on news that the Financial Services Authority had relaxed capital rules to boost UK lending. Lloyds Banking Group added 4 per cent to 38.5p and Royal Bank of Scotland was up 2.1 per cent to 262.7p.Man Group climbed 3.8 per cent to 93.4p, a five-month high, after press reports reheated takeover speculation.The bid theories helped distract from another weekly decline for Man’s key AHL fund and uncertainty about a trading update next week, which analysts say was likely to show a fifth consecutive quarter of net outflows. RBC forecast Man’s outflows to have accelerated to $2.5bn for the third quarter.Meanwhile, the traders who were pushing Man as a bid target on Tuesday had moved on to United Utilities. The water group rose 1.6 per cent to 729p on familiar speculation of interest from infrastructure investors and sovereign wealth funds.Imagination Technologies slid 9.4 per cent to 455.5p after Credit Suisse started coverage of the graphics chipmaker with an “underperform” rating and 247p valuation. It argued that the stock, at 21 times 2014 earnings, was not pricing in competitive threats.“We see Arm Holdings increasing its relevance as a competitor in this space with a full complement of graphics capabilities at half the price,” said Credit Suisse. “Of Imagination’s four key customers, Samsung this year moved to Arm graphics, Texas Instruments is exiting the wireless business and MediaTek could, in our view, try Arm graphics in its smartphone chips as it already uses its graphics in feature phones and TV.”Arm lost 2.9 per cent to 578.5p, with Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove saying the stock looked expensive.Domino’s Pizza lost 2.1 per cent to 519p after directors Stephen Hemsley and Nigel Wray raised £5.2m each by selling stock.
44;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-09-03T10:26:34Z;US military contractors – war horses;A tough battle that will not be won by financial engineers;The past decade or so has been a good time to be a contractor working for the US military or intelligence agencies. Between 2000 and 2010 the military budget grew 9 per cent a year, to about $690bn, faster than the budget as a whole or any of the big budget items besides Medicare. The Department of Homeland Security had a fiscal 2010 budget of $55bn, $15bn more than five years before.More recent years have been tougher. In 2010 both the secretary of defence and the CIA director went on record in the Washington Post voicing serious concerns about how many key jobs were being filled by contract employees. But the debate is not just over who should fight wars or collect intelligence. It is about how many soldiers and spies the country can afford. Hence the 2011 Budget Control Act and its threat of sequestration. If Congress is unable to agree to cut the federal budget by $1.2tn over 10 years, automatic cuts kick in next year with the axe falling heaviest on the military.Shares in the largest contractors that make the fanciest weapons systems – Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin – have held up over the past few years. Smaller contractors that specialise in providing personnel and technical support have had a tougher time. L-3, SAIC, ManTech and CACI International have all lagged behind the wider market badly. SAIC announced last week that, in an effort to create shareholder value, it would separate its low-margin IT and services arm from its higher-margin technology solutions business. This follows two other separations of lower-value divisions by Northrop Grumman (it spun off Huntington Ingalls) and L-3 (Engility). Neither of the earlier moves has generated much in the way of outsize returns, as a recent Credit Suisse analysis shows. This industry faces a tough battle, one that will not be won by financial engineers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
45;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BAE Systems – death by a thousand cuts;Reduced US defence spending means tougher times ahead;"Most industries faced with a potential $500bn of spending cuts over the next decade would pack up and go home. Defence is not just any old industry, however: the big defence contractors deal only in the big numbers and they have feasted at the Pentagon’s trough for more than a decade. That party is over.The US defence budget has already been shaved by $487bn over the next 10 years. The question is whether a further $500bn could be forthcoming (Washington will decide next year). Half-year figures from BAE Systems on Thursday give a glimpse of what life is like in tougher times.BAE’s numbers were not, in fact, half bad. Sales were down 10 per cent at £8.3bn, but basic earnings per share were unchanged year-on-year and the group operating margin was steady at 11 per cent. The figures chime with results from General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman last week: the industry’s margin is generally 11-12 per cent, though it varies widely depending on what is being produced. For example, BAE’s UK platforms and services division saw its operating margin jump by half in the first six months of this year, to nearly 16 per cent.That is good: margins will be important as contractors look to cut costs and increase productivity. The additional $500bn of cuts to the US defence budget (10 per cent of total US defence spending) are likely to fall primarily on hardware rather than personnel or the institutional structure of the US military. The US accounts for 40 per cent of BAE’s business; its US revenues could face a 10 per cent hit. The US defence contractors could be hit even more.Thank goodness for order backlogs. BAE’s is $60bn, compared with $40bn at Northrop and General Dynamics. And for other markets. As BAE’s haggling with Saudi Arabia over the re-pricing of its Typhoon aircraft contract shows, though, nothing in defence is quite what it seems.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
46;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-07-25T19:05:37Z;Defence earnings fall as US cuts loom;;Three of the biggest US defence contractors have reported falling earnings and warned of more trouble ahead as a looming automatic $500bn defence budget cut early next year clouds their outlook.Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and the defence division of Boeing were all hit in the second quarter of this year. Like much of the industry, they are making deep cost and staff cuts.The outlook is decidedly mixed, with General Dynamics cutting its full-year earnings per share estimates, while Northrop Grumman took a bullish approach, noting a “robust level of new business capture, the increase in total backlog and strong cash generation” as it increased its full-year forecast.There is growing frustration in the US defence establishment over US lawmakers’ inability to hatch a new government budget, which means the threat of the $500bn automatic defence cut edges ever closer.Unless lawmakers come up with a budget or agree to postpone the fall of the axe – which comes on top of approximately $490bn cuts already made – the additional reduction will take effect on January 2.Worse, say executives, is the fact that the cut would be indiscriminate, meaning they have no guidance on which projects to curtail and which would remain important to the evolving US defence strategy.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor, which announced robust earnings earlier this week, said the company was adapting to the difficult climate by cutting costs, consolidating work, reducing its workforce and lobbying lawmakers.“We’ve petitioned Congress and the administration to find an alternative method …to reduce costs and lower the debt, but if sequestration [automatic spending reduction] is going to occur, then we need more detailed information as to how to properly plan and execute our responsibilities,” he said.Northrop Grumman’s profit fell to $480m in the second quarter, down $40m from a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $6.27bn from $6.56bn. But the company managed to boost earnings per share to $1.88 from $1.81 by reducing outstanding shares.General Dynamics’ second-quarter net profit fell to $634m from $653m a year before, while sales edged up to $7.92bn from $7.88bn. Earnings per share were $1.79, compared to $1.77.Boeing was helped by the fact that more than half its revenue comes from civil aerospace, where the market is far more favourable as high oil prices prompt airlines to order new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.Revenues at Boeing’s defence, space and security division were $8.2bn, up 7 per cent, though earnings from operations slipped 6 per cent to $748m.James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, the second-largest US defence contractor by sales, said: “While the threat of budget sequestration and future US defence cuts continue to create uncertainty, international markets continue to offer a broad set of sales opportunities.”

In 1951 visitors could choose from 18,500 beds in the town’s bed and breakfast and guest house accommodation.But its fortunes changed dramatically in the 1970s as Britons jetted off to the Mediterranean on newly affordable package holidays.“Hastings lost out to Malaga and failed to develop alternative employment opportunities,” said Jeremy Birch, leader of Hastings borough council. “We suffered from the short-sightedness of our forefathers.”The town ranks as the most deprived area in the south-east and its claimant count for May – which measures those claiming jobseekers’ allowance – was 6.1 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent across the country.Graham Marley, chief executive of the Hastings chamber of commerce, said some local businesses had faced challenges in recruiting in the area: “Educational attainment has been poor, albeit over the past two years it has started to show significant improvement.”Better results have followed the creation of an academy school, sponsored by the University of Brighton and BT, as well as a new further education college. Business facilities in the town have also been improved with the help of government investment.Key employers include insurers Saga and Hastings Direct, defence contractor General Dynamics and a cluster of companies specialising in vacuum products for scientific markets.One of these, Kurt J Lesker, played a part in perhaps the most technically demanding task of modern times – the quest for the Higgs boson particle. The company, which employs about 70 people locally, provided vacuum components for Switzerland’s Large Hadron Collider, used to detect the subatomic particle.Jo Ainsley, Kurt Lesker’s human resources manager, said the company was happy with the quality of local recruits. “95 per cent of our workforce are from the Hastings area”, she said.
48;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-06-18T20:50:51Z;Private jets;Orders seem to indicate the industry is on the up;For four years the business jet industry has had precious few reasons for cheer. But last week NetJets, the fractional jet company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, placed orders for up to 425 new aircraft worth almost $10bn. After sales slumped about 60 per cent between 2008 and 2011, is the sector finally on the up?Certainly the order highlights improvements at NetJets. During the recession the company had it rough. In 2009 it generated a pre-tax loss of $710m and would have collapsed without support from Berkshire. But in 2011 NetJets made pre-tax profits of $230m thanks to new management and cost cutting.The outlook for the market, however, looks mixed. On the one hand, companies purchase about 65 per cent of all business aircraft so corporate profits are a main indicator of demand. And despite economic uncertainty, earnings continue to be strong. That bodes well for the sector. On the other hand, amid the eurozone crisis, business jet traffic has flattened out after a modest recovery in 2010 and remains about 15 per cent below pre-recession levels in Europe and the US. Stocks of used aircraft for sale also remain high, pressuring jet prices.Adding to the confusion, sales and prices of large jets, such as those built by Bombardier and Gulfstream, part of General Dynamics, have held up, but makers focused on small jets have struggled. In May, Hawker Beechcraft filed for Chapter 11. New entrants such as Honda and Eclipse Aerospace will only compound the problem of overcapacity.Even the NetJets order may be less than meets the eye. Bombardier and Cessna, part of Textron, won new contracts, but a handful of long-time suppliers lost out.

It produced 100 Mark IV tanks in the first world war and has been heavily involved in tank and armoured vehicle production ever since, getting a new lease on life in the past decade as the UK went to war in Afghanistan.But with combat units preparing to pull out from what many analysts believe could be the UK’s last ground war, orders have dried up for the Terrier tracked road-clearing vehicle BAE has made on Tyneside following its acquisition of Alvis Vickers in 2004.Europe’s biggest defence contractor said on Thursday that it would close the site by the end of 2013 with the loss of 330 jobs. A further 280 jobs will go at its munitions businesses that supplied armoured vehicles with shells.There is no prospect of new UK armoured vehicle manufacturing work once production of the Terrier ends, the company said in justifying its decision.But as poignant as the closure is to military enthusiasts, it marks an evolution rather than an end. By strict definition, the last British-built tank, the Challenger II, was made in the mid-1990s and the country is still involved in producing armoured vehicles. It has gone from “bashing metal to providing the brains”, said one executive.Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Defence earmarked £5.5bn for armoured vehicles. Much of that will go to procuring the specialised vehicles now in their second year of development by the UK-based arm of a US company.General Dynamics UK, part of US-based General Dynamics, is building the UK’s nexct generation of armoured vehicles. They are be based on the ASCOD, which is already in service in Austria and Spain.The vehicles will be assembled in the UK, with the hull coming from Spain, the engine and gearbox from Germany and the tracks and electronics from the UK. The company said about about 80 per cent of the value of the contents will be made in the UK.David Willey, curator of the Tank Museum in Dorset, said the tank’s obituary had been written before. “For some peculiar reason the tank just soldiers on,” said Mr Willey.“There’s a symbolic value. If you turn up in a Land Rover people throw stones at you. If you turn up in a tank, they say ‘maybe not today’.”Additional reporting by Chris Tighe in Newcastle
50;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-04-24T00:24:59Z;Lockheed fighter jet workers go on strike;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues, has been hit from two directions as workers at its Texas fighter jet facility went on strike and a spending watchdog urged Congress to cancel a key naval contract.Staff represented by a section of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Fort Worth at Lockheed’s Fort Worth plant took to the picket lines after voting against the company’s three-year contract proposals over the weekend.Union members are unhappy with clauses requiring them to contribute more to healthcare schemes and to accept different pension benefits for new recruits, despite an overall offer that includes a 3 per cent annual pay rise.The local IAM unit represents about 3,600 workers, many of whom work in assembling F-35 fighter jets. The plant employs about 14,000 workers in total.The stand-off also affects hundreds of Lockheed staff at two air force test sites.Bob Wood, an IAM spokesman, said the strike had hit workflow and said: “Nothing is happening in there.” But Lockheed insisted the company was well prepared and the plant remained open.Separately, the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog, urged leading congressional figures to scrap one strand of the controversial Littoral Combat Ship programme.The navy has made the LCS a cornerstone of its long-term shipbuilding plans and it could spend more than $37bn buying about 55 ships from two teams of suppliers, one led by Lockheed, the other by General Dynamics.Pogo said Navy papers showed Lockheed’s USS Freedom has had cracks and engine problems.“We recommend the more expensive and severely flawed Lockheed variant be eliminated,” it said.Lockheed said: “Reports cited by Pogo are based on selective information that is more than a year old”, adding that the purpose of testing a new class of ships was to reveal any problems. Lockheed said the project was on time and on budget.A Navy spokesman said the service was “reviewing the concerns mentioned” and that issues were not unexpected in a new class of ship and had been corrected. “We are fully confident that LCS 1 and the rest of the class will perform as designed,” he said.Lockheed reports results on Thursday and is already under intense scrutiny for its F-35 project, which has taken years longer than planned and cost more than estimated.
51;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-03-08T23:04:56Z;General Dynamics lays plans for succession;;The board of General Dynamics, the second-biggest US defence company by revenues, has appointed Phebe Novakovic president and chief operating officer, positioning her as the likely successor to Jay Johnson, chief executive.GD said that Ms Novakovic, 54, who heads up the Marine Systems division and was previously a senior vice-president of planning and development, will start in her new roles on May 2. Mr Johnson, 65, will continue as chairman and chief executive.Mr Johnson said that Ms Novakovic had “performed well” in her present and prior jobs and was “more than ready to assume a larger role in the corporation”. Ms Novakovic, he said, would assist in managing GD’s business groups and its headquarters operations.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, said: “GD has effectively anointed Phebe as Jay’s successor, and at some point in the next few years we expect her to be promoted to the chief executive role if everything goes smoothly.”In recent years it has become common practice for contractors to test out future leaders as chief operating officers before further promotion. For example, Northrop Grumman appointed Wes Bush to the role in 2007 before bumping him up to the top job in 2010.Mr Stallard added that he did not expect any significant changes in GD’s strategy as a result of the moves: “We see this as a positive step … Ms Novakovic has a good reputation with investors and this clarifies GD’s management succession plans.”GD shares, which have climbed about 8 per cent over the year to date, rose about 1 per cent to close at $72.01.GD had revenues of $32.7bn in 2011 and employs about 95,100 people worldwide. The contractor makes everything from nuclear submarines to battle tanks and also owns Gulfstream, the manufacturer of business aircraft.
52;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2012-01-25T17:21:55Z;Defence industry braced for era of austerity;;Defence industry executives are bracing themselves for dramatic spending cuts as the Pentagon, the world’s biggest buyer of military equipment and services, prepares to release its budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.Later on Thursday, Leon Panetta, US defence secretary, is expected to provide new details of cuts to procurement programmes and troop numbers as his department attempts to make good on promises to trim about $500bn from its plans over the next decade.For companies such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, the 2013 fiscal year defence budget proposal, and the longer-range forecasts that accompany it, is the latest reminder that the decade-long boom the sector has enjoyed on the back of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is now drawing to a close.Analysts expect the scale of the cuts to put pressure on revenues and profits across the board. JPMorgan expects organic revenues at the largest contractors to decline about 5 per cent in 2012, and another 5 per cent in 2013.Eventually, the cuts could lead to a reorganisation of the sector, with companies shedding their poorer performing assets and new entrants from Israel to the UK providing the fighting equipment of the future – advanced computer-driven programmes, such as UAVs (drones), cyber security, surveillance and autonomous systems (robots).Traditional defence contractors will have to find “the courage to shrink” by cleaning up their portfolios, said John Dowdy of McKinsey. Indeed, Northrop Grumman spinning off its shipbuilding business last March has been cited as one example of that future trend.In the past 12 years “the rising tide lifted all boats”, Mr Dowdy said. That is no longer the case and some are going to run out of new orders quickly in this tougher market. But he saw little room left for big mergers after the consolidation of the 1990s that left the top 10 companies controlling 60 per cent of the market.Many of the cuts that the US military will have to make are expected to come at the expense of the army and marines as Washington turns from fighting ground wars to relying on its navy and air force to spread its influence, particularly in Asia.This could lead to fewer vehicles, munitions, radios and ground-based electro-optical equipment, hitting companies such as BAE, General Dynamics and L-3 Communications that generate between 15 and 35 per cent of their revenues from sales to the US army alone.New projects are also at risk and even the F-35 fighter jet may not entirely avoid the cuts due to its long-running development problems and sheer scale.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital, estimates that up to 175 jets could be cut from the plan over five years. That would hit Lockheed, Northrop and BAE, the main companies involved, and also defence departments from London to Tokyo for whom the average cost of an F-35 would subsequently rise.In many respects, however, the 2013 fiscal year budget is but a prelude to a more painful fight. With the failure of the supercommittee to agree a deficit reduction deal, the Pentagon faces a further $500bn of automatic cuts over the next decade starting in January 2013.Many observers believe it may not come to such drastic measures but they say political inaction could lead to delays in defence procurement as officials become cautious about making expensive purchases for which they risk later being criticised.For companies, that means less clarity in an industry that relies on programmes which often cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete. From an operational point of view, company executives say they will be left with the uncomfortable decision of whether to maintain a workforce in case an order comes through eventually, or to let it go and risk losing any competitive edge in that area.One issue, however, provides a glimmer of hope. Heidi Wood, with Morgan Stanley, argues the budget crisis is so acute, that politicians may finally be forced to address the biggest cost concerns within the military – medical coverage and pensions – and that could free up cash for equipment programmes.
53;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-11-14T23:08:07Z;Buffett reveals $10.7bn stake in IBM;;Berkshire Hathaway has taken a stake in IBM worth more than $10bn, its first big investment in a sector historically shunned by Warren Buffett.In a CNBC interview on Monday, the 81-year-old billionaire disclosed that he had secretly amassed a 5.5 per cent stake worth $10.7bn in the US information technology company since March.“I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” Mr Buffett said, citing the company’s unusual five-year plan outlining earnings per share, cash positions and shareholder-return goals until 2015.IBM, which had not been previously informed of Mr Buffett’s stake, declined to comment. Its shares ended the day unchanged at $187.The move further vindicates the strategy adopted by Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, who will step down next month after nine years in which he transformed the company from a hardware manufacturer into an IT services and consulting specialist.Mr Buffett had previously avoided the sector, saying he did not understand tech companies or their products well enough to take large stakes.Under Mr Palmisano, IBM has provided a level of disclosure rare for such a large public company. It intends to generate operating earnings per share of at least $20 by 2015, while spending $20bn on acquisitions between 2011 and 2015.Last month,IBM reported $26.2bn in third-quarter revenues, with most of the growth coming from emerging markets. It also forecast full-year profits of $13.35 per share, up 14 per cent year on year.Since 2000, the company has disposed of commodity businesses, including its PC and hard-drive divisions, and increased software’s earnings contribution from 25 to 44 per cent last year. Software is expected to account for half of IBM’s business by 2015.IBM recently announced that Ginni Rometty will succeed Mr Palmisano from the start of next year, making her IBM’s first female chief executive.Speaking ahead of Berkshire’s disclosure of its equity holdings, Mr Buffett added that he was not investing in European banks as he did not feel he knew enough about the industry and had not come across an interesting investment opportunity.The company later disclosed five new investments made during the quarter. At the end of September Berkshire owned stakes valued between $195m and $232m in Intel, drug store chain CVS Caremark, broadcaster DirecTV, Visa, and defence group General Dynamics.Mr Buffett also sold about a 10th of his holdings of Kraft Foods and Johnson & Johnson during the quarter, leaving Berkshire with positions worth $3.2bn and $2.4bn respectively.
54;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-11-07T19:53:43Z;Inquiry worries send HomeServe to two-year low;;HomeServe hit a two-year low in a flat London market on Monday as concerns grew that a mis-selling investigation could damage its expansion prospects.The FTSE 250-listed home repairs group dropped 7.9 per cent to 297p on a report that it had ignored 48,000 customer complaints. The stock has tumbled by 39 per cent since HomeServe last week suspended its sales force after discovering potential mis-selling of insurance policies.Compensation costs would be unlikely to exceed £2m, analysts said. However, they saw the reputational damage as greater, particularly if the Financial Services Authority chooses to start an investigation.“We believe it will add to concerns that potential US business partners may already have about signing a deal,” said Peel Hunt. “Growth overseas, particularly in the US, is a core part of the Homeserve investment case and, with that coming under increasing pressure, we maintain our sell recommendation.”The FTSE 100 ended down 0.3 per cent, or 16.34 points, at 5,510.82 as the eurozone once again eclipsed all other stories.British Airways owner IAG was the sharpest faller, down another 4.5 per cent to 149¾p as brokers cut forecasts in the wake of results on Friday.“The premium business is set to suffer from the deteriorated economic backdrop within the next two to three months even if management has yet to note a downturn in demand in long-haul flights so far,” said Oddo Securities.An in-line trading update from Weir Group sent the engineer 3.7 per cent lower to £18.60 on profit-taking. Arm Holdings faded 3.8 per cent to 620½p in spite of industry gossip that Microsoft’s next generation Xbox would use its chip designs.Icap, last week’s sharpest blue-chip faller, bounced 3.5 per cent to 362¾p. Currency and rates trading is likely to have held up better than credit or equities and, though October was weak with electronic volumes up 2 per cent year on year compared with an average of 15 per cent, Icap has said it has not lost market share, Oriel Securities said.Mid-cap defence contractors were in focus after General Dynamics bought Force Protection, a maker of armoured vehicles, for $360m cash. Qinetiq added 1.1 per cent to 121¼p while Cobham was 0.4 per cent softer at 176p.“This is the first pure defence deal we have seen and while General Dynamics is likely to derive substantial synergies from the transaction, it comes at a pretty high multiple,” said JPMorgan Cazenove. The offer valued Force Protection at 11 times underlying earnings compared with a UK defence sector at an average of 6.4 times, it said.Weaker than expected third-quarter results sent Rentokil Initial 3.8 per cent lower at 66¼p. The focus was on a reduced cost-savings target and another poor quarter for City Link, Rentokil’s loss-making mail delivery business.International Personal Finance drifted 2.8 per cent 218½p after Hungary last week proposed capping interest rates on unsecured personal loans at 24 percentage points above the base rate.Downgrading IPF to “hold”, Collins Stewart said the threat of a law being implemented by January 1 would be “potentially devastating” as it was likely to force a material increase in impairments.Premier Foods rallied 9.9 per cent to 3.7p after lenders agreed to postpone a covenant test on its £1.27bn debt pile until March.Fashion retailer Supergroup was 8.8 per cent higher at 652p amid a short squeeze ahead of a trading update due Wednesday.Betfair rose 2.6 per cent to 789½p, helped by Numis Securities “buy” advice.The value of wagers placed on Betfair’s betting exchange rose 13 per cent in the quarter just ended, suggesting interim results due next month should match forecasts, Numis said. “This momentum, with the promise of more to come as the sportsbook is added to the site, will, we believe contribute to improved investor sentiment in relation to Betfair,” it argued.Among small caps, DTZ Holdings plunged 86.6 per cent to 2.85p after the property agency, which put itself up for sale last month, said there was “minimal value, if any,” in its shares.Xchanging rose 11.4 per cent to 78p after saying it was on track to meet its 2011 profit expectations.Polish explorer Aurelian Oil & Gas rose 6.5 per cent to 24½p on stake building by Kulczyk Investments, a vehicle run by Aurelian non-executive director Dariusz Mioduski.
55;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-10-09T23:59:40Z;Embraer faces headwinds;Brazilian aircraft maker battles to stay on course in recession;Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, is striving to stay on course in its effort to break into the front rank of the world’s manufacturers of business jets despite the turmoil in the global economy.It is just over halfway in its ambitious 10-year programme to challenge the established industry leaders with the development of a range of executive aircraft aimed at addressing most market segments from light jets to ultra-large business aircraft.It already has a successful aerospace track record as the upstart taking on the incumbent player and winning. In the past decade and a half Embraer has become the world’s leading maker of regional jets – commercial aircraft of up to 120 seats – overtaking its Canadian rival Bombardier.In the business jet arena it is facing far more rivals, however – not just Bombardier but also other well-established groups, Cessna (part of Textron), Gulfstream (part of General Dynamics) and Hawker Beechcraft of the US, and Dassault of France.At the same time Embraer’s assault on the corporate jet market is being conducted in the most adverse economic circumstances, which have inevitably taken a heavy toll on demand for new aircraft.Worldwide industry deliveries of business jets have tumbled from a peak of 1,313 in 2008 to 763 last year and there was a further 27 per cent fall to only 261 in the first half of 2011 from 355 in the same period a year ago.Despite such daunting challenges Ernest Edwards, president of Embraer Executive Jets since May this year, says the group is still on track. “We have not halted or slowed any development programmes. We have maintained our tack, which is fairly astonishing in the economic circumstances. We are meeting our objectives. We are six years through this plan to become a major player in executive jets by 2015.”Last year it claimed 19 per cent of world business jet deliveries (the numbers are flattered by its dominance of light jets), up from 14 per cent in 2009, and a 6.9 per cent share of the global industry by revenues.Embraer launched its full-scale attack on the business jet market in 2005, when the fortunes of the industry were riding high. It has been forced for more than three years to swim against the toughest economic tide, however, while continuing to invest heavily in research and development.The industry has been hit by plunging sales, falling prices and swollen inventories of used jets. Some smaller makers as well as business jet operators have collapsed, and much-vaunted new business models in particular for air taxi activities have proved largely unworkable.For its earliest corporate jet forays Embraer was able to take advantage of its regional jets by developing derivative products based on the commercial jet airframes, starting with its Legacy 600. This super midsize executive aircraft, with a capacity for 10 to 14 passengers and a range of 3,400 nautical miles (6,297kms) was derived from its 50-seat ERJ145 airliner. Announced in 2000, the first delivery was in 2002.This was followed by an incursion into the top end of the market with the launch of the Lineage 1000 jet in the ultra-large executive jet segment, based on the 100-seat Embraer 190 regional airliner. First delivery was in 2009.The big gamble and commitment to business jets was revealed in 2005, however, with the announcement by Embraer of its aim to become a major player in the sector within a decade. It revealed it was developing an all-new family of aircraft at the bottom end of the market to take advantage of the nascent segment for light and very light jets.Deliveries of the entry-level Phenom 100, capable of carrying six passengers, began at the end of 2008 with 97 delivered in 2009 and 100 in 2010. The related but larger Phenom 300 light jet was delivered to its first customer in 2009 with a further 26 delivered last year.By now Embraer had hoped combined output of the Phenom family would have reached as many as 150 a year, but Mr Edwards said the current forecast was for 100 deliveries in 2011, a 21 per cent drop from last year, as the continuing global economic uncertainty takes its toll.He insists the next building blocks in the strategy remain in place, however, as Embraer presses on with the development of a new family of aircraft, the mid-light and midsize Legacy 450 and 500 corporate jets, announced in 2008.The fuselage of the initial prototype Legacy 500 has been assembled and is being mated to the wing this month. The Brazilian group is hoping the first flight will take place before the end of the year. Two prototypes will be flown to complete the certification programme and first delivery into customer hands should take place in 2014. The 450 will follow 12 months later.Mr Edwards admits that by 2015 the “most obvious” gap in the Embraer range will be an ultra-long-range executive jet but says: “We have not identified a date for when we might fill the gap or whether we will fill it.”By the time the mid-light Legacy 450 (7-9 passengers and a range of 4,260kms) enters service in 2015, Embraer will have committed around $1bn to its business jet gamble.Despite its relative shrinking to the rest of the world, the US remains by far the biggest market for business jets with a share last year of about 43 per cent, and it is here that Embraer has made its biggest investment in sales and marketing and customer support.Since 2008 it has opened three factory-owned full maintenance and support centres on greenfield sites in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mesa, Arizona and Hartford, Connecticut. It has also, in Melbourne, Florida, built an assembly plant for the Phenom 100 and a mock-up centre where customers can specify the interiors of aircraft. It will deliver its first US-assembled jet by the end of the year.However, Embraer can only watch and wait to see what the state of the global economy will be by the time it has completed its development programme. “There is still turmoil and this is causing consternation,” says Mr Edwards. “There are pockets of resistance to the malaise, in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia and in Latin America . . . We have a broad range of products and we have a world in which to sell them.”
56;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-10-09T23:59:40Z;Good move, bad timing;Jet Aviation has potential to repay General Dynamics’ confidence;In retrospect, the decision by General Dynamics to spend $2.2bn buying Jet Aviation, the business-jet services company, in the summer of 2008 was spectacularly unlucky timing – coming just weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers heralded the global financial crisis.The US defence and aerospace group had been trying to buy Jet for several years, but had been beaten in 2005 by Permira, the European investment firm, which purchased the company from the Hirschman family of Switzerland. During its three-year stewardship, Permira grew the business partly through acquisitions, including the takeover of Midcoast Aviation and Savannah Air Center in the US.What attracted General Dynamics – which already had a strong presence in the business-jet market with its ownership of Gulfstream, the aircraft-maker – was the opportunity to diversify into business aircraft servicing and to expand its international reach via Jet Aviation’s global network.While its timing may have been off, that strategic logic may still make Jet a good acquisition – even if it takes several years to become evident.Nicholas Chabraja, General Dynamics’ chairman and chief executive at the time of the purchase, identified the opportunity to expand the company’s maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business as central to the transaction. “This is the part of the business that drove our interest in Jet Aviation,” Mr Chabraja said at the time.Then came the crisis, and a sharp drop-off in sales and usage of business jets. Nevertheless, analysts such as Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital Markets say General Dynamics was right to try to expand into MRO.“Over time it will be considered a good purchase,” Mr Lewis predicts. “It diversifies the company’s revenue from just production and offers a higher recurring revenue base on the services side of the business.”Jet Aviation is one of the leading global business-jet maintenance companies. The business was founded in 1967 in Europe and went on to establish operations in the Americas, Asia and the Middle East.It has four main business segments – fixed base operations (FBOs), charter and aircraft management, aircraft maintenance and “completions” – the outfitting of business jets of all sizes.Jet has an impressive international presence, and 60 per cent of its business comes from outside the US. The company operates 15 FBO facilities around the world: five in the US (including at Teterboro in New Jersey, the closest business aviation airport to Manhattan), three in Germany, two in Switzerland, two in Saudi Arabia, as well as FBOs in the UK, Dubai and Singapore.Gary Dempsey, President of Jet Aviation Flight Services for the Americas, notes that whereas for most rivals, FBOs extend only to offering fuel and hangar services, Jet also offers MRO services at its FBO facilities.In addition to its FBOs, Jet also offers MRO facilities in Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil, Basel and Moscow, and has smaller operations in Kuala Lumpur and Paris.The kinds of services offered by Jet have become a critical element in airports’ attempts to attract high-end customers. As well as maintenance and fuel services, Jet’s facilities also feature luxury passenger lounges, private offices for meetings, concierge services and rooms where crews can rest between flights.While the servicing side of the business has held up relatively well in recent years, buoyed by continuing growth in Asia, the Middle East and Russia through the downturn, Jet Aviation’s completions business has suffered, with disappointing operating margins this year.The completions unit is still the biggest single division within the company, although the maintenance side has grown in importance.The problems with completions were in part due to issues beyond Jet’s control, such as the weakness and instability of the order backlog. Whereas the company enjoyed a three-to-four-year backlog in 2006-2007, that has shrunk to a couple of years.Moreover, Mr Dempsey says, aircraft were often delivered by manufacturers three to six months late, while some customers were slow in picking up their completed aircraft. Or, in a few cases, failed to pick them up at all.But while the company stresses external issues, Jay Johnson, General Dynamics chief executive, admitted in July that the completions business had performed poorly and he announced he was overhauling the division.“I think the best way for me to describe that is to say that what happened to us at jet completions is that the volume in the front door overcame the throughput efficiency that we had,” Mr Johnson said in a conference call with analysts. “We brought them in the front door but couldn’t get them out the back door in a timely enough manner.”The highest-profile casualty of Mr Johnson’s cull was Peter Edwards, Jet Aviation’s president, who resigned a few weeks before the restructuring was announced. He was replaced by Dan Clare, Gulfstream’s former chief financial officer. The company has also put in place new leaders at its completions facilities in St Louis and Basel.Mr Johnson predicts that the completions business will start to recover next year. While new management may help, ultimately that depends on new business-jet sales bouncing back. If global economic uncertainty persists, General Dynamics may have to push its expectations back another year.
57;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-09-20T17:04:38Z;Defence groups diversify amid budget cuts;;Defence contractors are renewing efforts to expand their non-military businesses as they search for strategies to cope with declining defence budgets worldwide.Last month, General Dynamics, the fourth-biggest US defence contractor by government revenues, agreed to buy Vangent – which provides healthcare information technology services to the Department of Health and other agencies – for about $960m in cash.Also last month, Lockheed Martin, the biggest US defence contractor by revenues, snapped up QTC Holdings, which provides medical evaluation services to the Department of Veterans Affairs, for an undisclosed sum.Though better-known for their tanks and aircraft, most large contractors have established positions in non-defence markets. Lockheed has built a multibillion-dollar federal IT services unit, while GD has an IT unit and owns Gulfstream, the maker of business jets.But experts say the recent decisions point to a revived interest in certain non-military markets as companies undertake broader strategic reviews of their portfolios and struggle to sustain their revenue lines and to find profitable uses for their cash.“The industry has talked for a long time about getting into adjacent markets to help grow the business and help offset the declines in defence spending. But a lot of it has been talk and now you are starting to see some real activity,” said Scott Thompson, who leads PwC’s aerospace and defence practice.Most defence deals are likely to remain within core sectors, such as defence electronics, but industry bankers note that limited growth in the base businesses and competition for more attractive assets will drive companies further afield.Jay Caldwell, head of the aerospace and defence investment banking group at RBC Capital Markets, said a number of clients had requested a complete “white board” analysis of options and expects a “wave” of deal activity, if financial markets stabilise.Industry consultants point to healthcare IT, cybersecurity and energy markets as attractive targets for defence companies given their scale, their faster than average growth profiles and their “short commutes” from existing businesses.For example, by 2016 the Department of Veterans Affairs alone will spend $4.1bn on IT systems, up from about $3.2bn in 2011, much of it on healthcare IT, while state and local healthcare IT spending will rise from $8.6bn to $10.1bn in 2011, according to Deltek, a software provider.Still, non-defence markets are not a magic bullet. Earlier this year, Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, told investors that cybersecurity, healthcare IT and energy markets were maturing “a little slower than we anticipated”.Mr Stevens also promised that the company would not “lower our standards and pursue initiatives in areas where we don’t believe we can be successful …If we can’t find acquisitions that make a lot of sense …we’ll continue to pursue our share buy-back programme [and] our dividend programme.”The defence industry has a mixed record when it comes to exploiting other markets. Lockheed, for example, tried to move into commercial telecommunications in the 1990s, buying Comsat for several billion dollars only to sell the business in pieces a few years later.Norm Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed and undersecretary of the army, noted wryly more than a decade ago that the “industry’s record of diversification is unblemished by success”.However, Denis Bovin, co-chief executive of Stone Key Partners, which advises the aerospace and defence industry, insists that the industry has learnt its lesson. “Rather than wildly diversifying, companies are looking for areas that take them further from their base but don’t require learning a whole new business,” he said.Mr Bovin added that the Vangent and QTC deals were “not so much about diversification. Rather, they are about dealing with the federal customer in a different way. The acquirers are choosing to grow in areas where they already feel comfortable.”To demonstrate their new-found conservatism, defence companies prefer to talk of making smaller deals in “adjacent markets” rather than “diversification”, said one analyst. “It suggests nothing completely out of left field, just stuff we can see over the fence.”So far, Lockheed has pushed further than most, investing in research projects to create power from the difference in temperature in the oceans as well as making forays into smart grid technology and energy efficiency.But the strategy has been a careful and largely organic one, starting with a focus on the military and then moving on to other parts of the federal government before attempting to sell to utility companies.“We have taken a phased approach and managed our entry into the market as opposed to making a super-large acquisition that might be more risky,” Ray Johnson, chief technology officer at Lockheed, told the Financial Times last year.However, Mr Caldwell questioned whether the industry discipline will last. “The large prime contractors will very quickly gnaw through the natural adjacencies and then the big challenge will be what fields do they move on to next?”
58;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-09-16T23:18:16Z;Groups express interest in MoD division;;BAE Systems, General Dynamics and Babcock have all approached the British government to express interest in buying the Ministry of Defence’s military equipment maintenance division.The Defence Support Group provides in-house repair and upgrade services to the UK military to maintain equipment and manage fleets of aircraft, tanks and armoured vehicles.Although formally owned by the MoD, it operates as a semi-autonomous trading fund, and has an annual turnover of £200m ($316m) and 3,000 employees.Given DSG’s role in maintaining equipment, it works closely with defence contractors. For example, it works with General Dynamics UK in upgrading Bowman radio systems in UK vehicles in Afghanistan. This makes DSG an attractive ‘adjacent’ business for potential acquisItion by defence companies.DSG was put up for sale as part of a package of measures in last October’s Strategic Defence and Security Review to save £4.3bn in defence spending in the next four years.At the time, the government said the sale of both DSG and the ’sea mounting centre’ – a 300 acre military port at Marchwood in Southampton – would generate a combined £500m.“ The decision to sell the DSG, announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review White Paper last October, has generated significant interest within industry,” said Peter Luff, the minister for Defence Equipment, Support & Technology, in a written response to a parliamentary question from Angus Robertson of the Scottish National Party.“We have received some early and speculative approaches from a number of companies, including BAE Systems, Babcock and General Dynamics UK …MoD officials have met informally with BAE and Babcock, at the request of the companies, to allow them to explain their interest in the DSG in more detail.”BAE Systems, Babcock and General Dynamics UK all declined to comment on Friday.
59;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Booz shares fell 6.4 per cent to $15.02.“The whole sector faces a tricky dilemma. The amount of bid opportunities has actually gone up, because after budget negotiations the government now has a backlog of contracts to put out to tender. So companies have increased spending around business development,” Mr Loomis said.“But if those contracts are not awarded so projects can be ramped up, and revenue starts flowing, it could be difficult.”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.2 per cent at 1,204.42, ending a four-day rally.Financial stocks fell 2.4 per cent, more than any other sector.Goldman Sachs was down 3.5 per cent to $112.16 after writing down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.The Federal Reserve Board had alleged a “pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton.Bank of New York Mellon outperformed the sector, despite the departure of chief executive Robert Kelly late on Wednesday.BNY Mellon shares were only down 0.2 per cent at $20.63 after Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove said the bank was sitting on a “staggering” cash pile.Semiconductor companies had a volatile day after analysts disputed whether burgeoning demand from smartphone manufacturers will be enough to compensate for falling sales to computer makers.Shares in Nvidia outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 per cent, after Kaufman Brothers analyst Mike Burton initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The Nasdaq was down 1.3 per cent at 2,546.04, but Nvidia shares were only off 0.2 per cent at $13.28.“We view Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the convergence of mobility and computing,” Mr Burton said.Glen Yeung, Citigroup’s technology analyst, also said smartphone demand could offset falling industrial demand ahead of an industry conference.“We expect the tone from chip companies to reflect uncertainty … we do not, however, expect chip companies to lower guidance en masse, reflecting the dearth of actual order cuts quarter-to-date.”That pushed Micron Technology and SanDisk, which manufacture Dram memory chips used in computers and phones, into positive territory in early trading. But Micron closed at $5.74, down 2.9 per cent for the day and SanDisk dropped 1 per cent to $36.27.Manufacturers with exposure to industries other than computing had outperformed in August but on Thursday their shares were pushed back as investors traded on enthusiasm for smartphones.Applied Materials, a company whose chips end up in solar panels, was off 2.3 per cent at $11.06.Novellus, whose semiconductors are used in various industrial processes, fell 3.3 per cent to $27.05 after the company used a mid-quarter update late on Wednesday to lower revenue targets.Not every analyst shared the enthusiasm for smartphones. Mr Yeung’s Citigroup colleague Henry Kim predicted a “double-dip in DRAM”.“We are revising down our global memory industry revenue forecast by 19 per cent on weaker pricing from low demand and expect industry revenue to decline by 13 per cent year on year in 2011 earnings,” Mr Kim said.Robert Lea, South Korea-based semiconductor analyst for Jefferies, who initiated coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor with a hold rating, was also downbeat on the sector.“Semiconductor industry inventories [excluding memory] have risen for seven consecutive quarters to an estimated 81.5 days”, while at the same time, “revenue growth has stalled”, Mr Lea said.TSM shares were down 0.7 per cent at $11.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent for the day at 11,493.57, pushing it back into negative territory for the year to date.
61;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-07-20T23:29:24Z;New front set to open in tank mergers;;Shrinking military budgets have long served as an incentive for European countries to look for cost-savings in equipment programmes. From joint projects to develop fighter jets and transport aircraft, to the more recent Franco-British proposals to share aircraft carriers, the trend has helped drive industrial partnership and outright consolidation in many spheres of the defence industry.But one part of the industry in Europe has remained less affected by such initiatives. Manufacturers of the wheeled and tracked vehicles used by land forces have so far avoided much of the consolidation that has taken place in – for example – the defence aerospace sector. But as defence budgets are subjected to a further tightening, will these outliers on the Continent be able to hold out?The contrast with the aerospace sector is revealing. Europe now has only three manufacturers of fighter aircraft: Saab, Dassault and the Eurofighter consortium made up of the UK’s BAE Systems, the Franco-German EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica. Eurofighter is an example of industrial partnership, but it is also an example of how several European countries can improve buying power by ordering the same aircraft, keeping acquisition costs down. This joint purchase process has also helped create the A400M, a military transport aircraft built by EADS but ordered by France, the UK, Germany and others.But in the sphere of wheeled or tracked vehicles, there are fewer examples of consolidation or joint purchases between countries. Across Europe a host of different companies makes wheeled and tracked vehicles, with varying degrees of armoured protection, to help land armies carry troops and equipment. They include BAE Systems, Krauss Maffei and Rheinmetall of Germany, Iveco of Italy and Patria of Finland. France has the most with Nexter, Panhard, Thales, and Renault Trucks Défense all involved in the sector.Not only has the industry in Europe not consolidated, it also has not seen much in the way of joint purchasing along the lines of the Eurofighter or A400M nations. The European Defence Agency, a European Union body that encourages joint procurement of armaments by EU members to keep costs down, has recently estimated that there were 16 different procurement programmes for armoured fighting vehicles.The closest that Europe has come to multi-country partnership in developing new technology has been the eight-wheeled Boxer armoured fighting vehicle, which was jointly developed by Germany and the Netherlands. While Boxer has now been delivered to both armies, the project lost two earlier partners along the way as France and the UK pulled out.Part of the reason for the continued large number of industry participants is the relatively cheap cost of land vehicles compared with ships or combat aircraft. A Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet costs €140m ($200m, £123m) and France’s Barracuda-class attack submarines cost about €1.4bn. But the Ocelot Foxhound armoured patrol cars recently ordered by the UK armed forces cost less than £500,000 each.“None of the countries in Eurofighter or the A400M had the ability to finance those projects themselves alone, so they had to partner,” says Christian Mons, chief executive of the French military vehicle group Panhard, and president of GICAT, the association of French land defence equipment manufacturers. “But up until now, most countries did have the means to finance the domestic development of land vehicle projects, so the pressure was not the same as in the naval, missile or aerospace sectors.”However, the recent downturn in developed economies has combined with a geopolitical shift that is specifically putting pressure on makers of military land vehicles.John Louth, deputy head of the Defence, Industries and Society programme at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, says: “Previously, the land vehicle space has been reasonably lucrative because of the number of urgent operational requirement purchases by the UK and US, but that’s diminishing now with the announcement of drawdowns and withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan.”These changing prospects for land vehicles have already been felt by the big defence companies. Last year, sales at BAE Systems’ land systems division dropped 12 per cent to £5.9bn.Some tentative moves have already been made in terms of industry consolidation over recent years: General Dynamics of the US bought both Austria’s Steyr-Puch and Switzerland’s Mowag, while the German groups Man and Rheinmetall announced they would merge their military vehicle businesses. But since then there has been little concrete in the way of consolidation.“Something is definitely going to happen, but it’s very difficult to say when,” says Tuija Nurmi, a Finnish politician who co-wrote a report on the European land vehicles sector for the European Security and Defence Assembly.In the absence of firm timescales, much attention is focusing on the countries deemed most likely to see possible consolidation, and here all eyes are on France. In March of this year, the state-owned Nexter, maker of the Leclerc battle tank used by the French army, announced that it was in discussions over possible co-operation with Thales, and Panhard said that it too was also open to co-operation with Thales.Laurent Collet-Billon, the head of the French government’s defence equipment procurement agency, has said that in addition to a possible Thales/Nexter combination, he could see a “rapprochement” between the two much smaller French groups in the sector: Panhard, and the Volvo-owned Renault Trucks Défense.For its part, Renault Trucks Défense is gamely talking about the opportunities still to be had abroad rather than the shrinking home markets or its potentially vulnerable status as a smaller company.“Europe is cutting the size of its militaries, but the rest of the world is boosting the spending,” says Nicolas de la Rue du Can, contract director of Renault Trucks Défense. “So regardless of all this commentary, the issue of consolidation inside Europe is a secondary problem. The real problem is to get a share of the market outside Europe.”This push to new markets is indeed proceeding apace. Last October, Iveco signed an agreement to build light armoured trucks in Russia, which is also negotiating to buy 500 armoured vehicles from Panhard.Another deal has resulted in Patria of Finland licensing designs to the Polish defence group Bumar. However, analysts still believe that squeezed budgets in home markets and sub-sized companies across Europe will combine to create more pressure than can be relieved through exports alone.“There has been some internationalisation of supply chains, but nothing like what we’ve seen in other parts of the defence industry like aerospace,” says Daniel Keohane, a defence industry expert at the Paris-based European Union Institute for Strategic Studies.“Equipment is getting more expensive and budgets are going down and something has got to give,” he added.

Mr Jobs’s appearance will allay concerns about his health.Apple shares were up 3.1 per cent to $347.83.Competition to dominate the new wave of demand for ultra-thin and portable computers was broadly driving chipmaker shares.The S&P 500 info technology sector was up 1.6 per cent and the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.5 per cent.The sector was included as a “best idea” by UBS and given a boost by analysts at Morgan Stanley. They wrote that “consumer adoption of solid state drives . . . is poised to accelerate in 2012”.Shares in SanDisk, the hard drive maker, were up 3.2 per cent to $47.52; competitor Western Digital rose 2.6 per cent to $36.65.Shares in Broadcom, maker of chips for high-speed wireless connections, corrected 1.5 per cent to $35.98 after jumping 10 per cent at the end of last week.Among the biggest laggards was Research in Motion, off 1.7 per cent at $42.85. This was despite rumours that a new 4G version of its Playbook tablet was coming to Sprint.The company has been under increasing pressure to fend off shareholder activists as it struggles to find its own ways to compete with Apple’s iPad and Google’s Android products.Also in the semiconductor sector, renewable energy groups were lifted by Germany’s announcement that it would decommission 17 nuclear plants by 2022. MEMC Electronic Materials, maker of wafer-thin solar energy chips, was technology’s top individual performer, rising 4 per cent to $10.52.First Solar rose 2.4 per cent to $124.25, despite a challenge last week from short-seller James Chanos, who said the company was losing too many top managers.The session was choppy as traders fought off a woeful batch of economic data.Housing prices have fallen below their 2009 nadir, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index. Consumer confidence and the Chicago purchasing managers' index also declined more in May than was anticipated.The Nasdaq Composite index led the way up-, adding 1.4 per cent at 2,835.30.The S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent at 1,345.20, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,569.79.The S&P opened the day at its 50-day moving average of 1,326, after testing – but not breaking through – its 100-day moving average of 1,316 last week.Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners, said: “The fact that the market was able to hold the key support level of the 100-day moving average is a positive and the fact that the market was able to move above the 50-day moving average is also a positive.“Now market participants are looking for more. Investors are looking for the overall stock market to break the pattern of lower highs and lower lows.”Pfizer led the Dow and was a bellwether for healthcare stocks, which continued their recent rally to rise 1.2 per cent, just behind technology shares. The giant drugmaker was up 2.5 per cent at $21.45 after it settled a patent disagreement with Teva, the generics maker, over the Neurontin epilepsy drug for an undisclosed amount.General Dynamics, the defence group, led the S&P 500 by rising 4.2 per cent to $74.22.It was awarded a $774m US Navy contract to build a new refuelling ship at its Nassco shipyards in San Diego on Monday and was upgraded by veteran sector analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to “buy”.Shares of Big Lots rose 3.1 per cent to $33.41, a standout among retailers. Barclays analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” and said that despite its cautious outlook, possible share buybacks will give earnings “a healthy boost”.Energy was 1 per cent higher, driven by oil and gas producers.

63;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-05-12T01:54:45Z;Obama defence cuts under fire;;Barack Obama’s drive to carry out big cuts to the defence budget – a key part of his plans to reduce the US’s fiscal deficit – has hit resistance on Capitol Hill.While the president wants to cut $400bn from defence spending over a dozen years, the House of Representatives is balking at much smaller cuts planned for the shorter term.At the House armed ser­vices committee on Wed­nesday, Buck McKeon, chairman, set out draft legislation that would water down plans to make savings from retired military personnel’s healthcare, in­crease money for the Abrams tank and throw a lifeline to a controversial project to build an alternative engine for the F-35 joint strike fighter.The debate marks the opening salvo in what is set to be a prolonged fight over defence spending for the next fiscal year and beyond. Although the totals en­dorsed by Mr Mc­Keon and the administration for core defence spending for the 2012 fiscal year are similar at about $553bn, the House proposals would affect the Pentagon’s ability to make further cuts from 2013.Attacking the administration for what he said was its plans for “arbitrary funding reductions”, Mr McKeon said his alternative would “advance our national security aims, provide the proper care and logistical support for our fighting forces, and help us meet the defence challenges of the 21st century”.Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus military reform pro­ject at the Center for Defence Information think-tank, described Mr McKeon’s position as “you can forget about defence contributing squat to deficit reduction”.Ballooning healthcare costs are one of the biggest sources of Pentagon expenditure. The government’s budget proposal for 2012 defence spending – the plan Mr McKeon’s legislation responds to – includes $53bn on healthcare for current personnel, reserve forces and retired personnel, up from $19bn in 2001.The House’s draft backs an administration proposal to increase the fees in 2012 for retired personnel of working age – the first such rise in more than a decade. But it would limit any further savings by mandating that any subsequent fee increases were in line with rises in pensions, rather than with healthcare costs.Mr McKeon has also backed an offer by General Electric and Rolls-Royce, makers of the joint strike fighter’s alternative engine – which the Pentagon has now pronounced dead – to pay for the project’s development costs for the next fiscal year, which could add up to $100m or more.The defence department has only recently managed to eliminate funding for the second engine, which it argues is unnecessary, after a titanic struggle with Congress. While GE puts the cost of completing the project at $1bn, the Pentagon argues the figure will be closer to $2.9bn.Other likely beneficiaries from the 2012 bill include General Dynamics, the Virginia-based aerospace and defence company. The chairman’s version of the House bill includes an extra $272m to sustain work on M1A2 Abrams tanks at GD’s plant in Lima, Ohio, which had been threatened by a production gap.In a further indication of reluctance to slash defence spending, Adam Smith, ranking Democrat on the committee, signalled support in his party’s congressional ranks for many of the legislation’s measures. But he questioned proposals that would make it harder for the president to transfer Guantánamo Bay detainees to third countries as well as restricting the use of civilian courts for their trial.……………………………………..Call for rethink on east Asia basesThree prominent senators have labelled US military basing plans in east Asia as “unrealistic, unworkable and unaffordable”, calling on the Pentagon to rethink its plans for the region, writes Daniel Dombey.John McCain, Carl Levin and Jim Webb say altering basing plans for Okinawa, Japan – unpopular locally – “would save billions in taxpayer dollars, keep US military forces in the region, reduce sensitive political issues …and reduce the American footprint”.As an alternative, they say personnel at Kadena air base in Okinawa should move to Guam or elsewhere in Japan, freeing up the base for US marines. They see this as an alternative to building an expensive replacement facility.The senators also propose delaying a basing realignment of US forces in South Korea, rethinking plans to increase the number of family members accompanying military personnel, and a reduced marines presence on Guam.Mr Levin said the existing US-Japan framework involved unrealistic projected times and unaffordable cost growth – and was further challenged by the fiscal and political realities in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami.“Our country has reached a critical moment in terms of redefining our military role in east Asia,” said Mr Webb.
64;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chemring to buy bomb-detection division;;Chemring, the UK-based maker of decoy flares and munitions, is to buy the bomb-detection division of General Dynamics in a $90m (£55m) all-cash deal to be funded by a separate £118m placing.General Dynamics’ Detection Systems business already supplies two big programmes for the US military, providing equipment that detects chemical and biological warfare vapours.“This gives us new technologies and better access to the biological and chemical side, where we’re less strong,” said David Price, chief executive of Chemring.“But it also gives us access to stand-off explosion detection technology, which can detect residues of explosives on surfaces and can also detect disturbed soil. We had already been working with them on stand-off detection product for about 12 months on that. We think these are also very good products for the export market, because at present, they’re essentially a US-centric business.”The deal will help boost Chemring’s existing bomb-detection business, which at present accounts for 20 per cent of group turnover. Most of Chemring’s revenues come from making munitions for warships, as well as so-called countermeasures – small flares that are fired by warplanes or ships to confuse enemy weapons.However, demand for protection from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq and Afghanistan has helped make Chemring’s counter-IED business the fastest growing part of the group, with sales more than doubling last year to £102m.One of Chemring’s main technologies in the field is Niitek, a detection system the size of a snooker table that is affixed to the front of an armoured truck to scan roads for IEDs.The deal announced on Wednesday follows on from a similar-sized acquisition last year, when Chemring paid £55m to acquire Roke Manor Research, a maker of roadside bomb detecting equipment, from Siemens. In 2007 and 2008, the group bought companies that make bomb-disposal robots and landmine detection devices.Last year, Detection Systems made pre-tax profit of $8.3m (£5.1m) on sales of $61.5m, making the deal worth slightly less than 11 times pre-tax profit, and 1.5 times annual revenues.The placing will create 17.4m new shares at 645p a share, a 3.6 per cent discount to the group’s closing price on Tuesday.The placing will account for 9.8 per cent of the existing share capital of Chemring, and will raise £112m before expenses.While £55m from the placing will be used to fund the acquisition, the balance will be used for further acquisitions and help bring down Chemring’s net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio from 2 times at present to 1.5 times.Shares in Chemring fell 6p to 675p on Wednesday.

AMR, American Airlines’ parent company, was down 1.9 per cent to $6.27 while Hawaiian Holdings lost 2.5 per cent to $5.88.In the wider markets US equities struggled for direction, with the S&P 500 moving only fractionally higher to 1,332.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,399.96, just a hair’s breadth away from 12,400, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,789.19.The materials sector led the gains, boosted by deal activity and slightly higher commodity prices. Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, was up 12 per cent to $66.34, after it purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m.Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn hostile bid for Equinox Minerals, sending US shares in the Toronto-based miner up 30.1 per cent to $7.76.Massey Energy, the coal miner, was up 0.9 per cent to $69.87 while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, added 1.3 per cent to $55.77. The S&P materials sector was up 0.7 per cent.But these gains were balanced out by losses in the technology sector after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales of semiconductors fell 1.1 per cent in February from the previous month to $25.2bn.Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company, lost 2.9 per cent to $30.60 while Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, fell 3.6 per cent to $17.55. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.9 per cent while the S&P technology index fell 0.5 per cent, the worst performing of the S&P 500 sectors.This neutral session followed on from 0.5 per cent gains on Friday after news that 216,000 US jobs had been created in March and that the unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low at 8.8 per cent.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the losses sustained following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. The index is 0.7 per cent below the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.According to Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund, technicals are going to be key over the coming months.He argues that if the S&P advances past 1,344, the mid-February high before the revolt in Egypt, then the index will continue up to 1,400. “If it fails to get to 1,344, we are going to retest the floor of 1,280,” he said.In corporate news, shares in Ambassadors International plunged 76.8 per cent to $0.65 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. Ambassador is the parent company of Windstar Cruises, the cruise ship operator.In the preceding two days shares in the company had rocketed in value, gaining 194.7 per cent.Pfizer, the drugmaker, added 0.8 per cent to $20.54 after agreeing to sell Capsugel, the world’s largest maker of hard capsules, to private equity group KKR for $2.4bn in cash.The sale will allow Pfizer to buy back common stock this year in excess of the $5bn in repurchases it was planning. But Pfizer also lowered its revenue forecast for 2011 and trimmed its 2012 revenue guidance as a result of the deal.Shares in Ford Motor continued to gain ground after news on Friday that it had overtaken General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker in March, while reporting a 19 per cent gain in US sales.The carmaker was up 2.6 per cent to $15.56, helped by an upgrade by Credit Suisse to “neutral” from “underperform”.Shares of defence contractor General Dynamics fell 5.2 per cent to $73.37 after Gulfstream Aerospace, its business jet unit, said that a jet crashed during a test flight on Saturday.
66;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-03-06T19:44:53Z;Defence: A question of scale;Pentagon spending is under rare scrutiny – but substantial cuts would have a wide impact;"High above the Pacific en route to Beijing in January, Robert Gates let slip he was travelling to China bearing gifts – not for the country’s rulers, with whom he soon squared off, but for US commanders in the region.Mr Gates’ staff soon fleshed out details of the plans – a new nuclear-capable bomber able to reach east Asia from the US, modernised radar for the F-15 fighter jet, a launch vehicle for sending satellites into space, and seaborne drone aircraft – aimed at countering China’s own military advances.All this – in parallel with $185bn to modernise America’s nuclear weapons systems over 10 years, increased spending on missile defence and more investments tailored for Afghanistan – forms part of President Barack Obama’s defence spending plans.Over the past decade, grand US defence budgets have faced little opposition, passed by Congress as part of the price for global leadership and the prosecution of the war on terror. But with Washington in a fever over the country’s record budget deficit and weary of foreign wars, Pentagon spending is now causing deep fissures across the political spectrum.Prominent conservatives, long a bastion of support for military spending, have joined forces in recent weeks with left-leaning opponents to back cuts to the Pentagon budget and even voted to cancel entire programmes. The war against the Taliban is gradually being framed by its opponents as a fiscal issue.So vast is the Pentagon’s budget – one in five government dollars goes on defence – that the impact of any cuts will reverberate around the world, influencing everything from a possible pull-out of US troops from Europe to the response to China’s rise and whether to invest in 20th-century equipment such as aircraft carriers or 21st-century cyberwar technology.More profoundly, the debate over the military is a symbol of the evolving new world order, in which US power is enfeebled at home by deficits and checked abroad by rising rivals. Two decades after historian Paul Kennedy coined the phrase “imperial overstretch” to describe a superpower committed beyond its means, the theory is fast approaching reality.“In 2000, we were responsible for one-third of the global economy and one-third of defence spending. Now, we have a quarter of global GDP [gross domestic product] and 46 per cent of defence spending,” says Loren Thompson, of the Lexington Institute, a Washington think-tank.US defence spending has almost doubled since the attacks of September 11 2001 and the invasions of Afgh-anistan then Iraq – even as the budget deficit rose under President George W. Bush then soared in the wake of the financial crisis. The Pentagon is seeking $540bn in the still-unresolved budget for the current fiscal year, in addition to $159bn on the two wars and the $7bn being spent by the Department of Energy on nuclear weapons.The Pentagon’s spending on health alone, which rose from $19bn in 2001 to a budgeted $53bn for 2012, amounts to the sixth-largest military budget in the world, just behind Russia and ahead of Germany. But rather than take on the system, Mr Obama has entrenched it, spending more on defence than Mr Bush did.The president has cast his decisions in terms of the nation’s safety – not least by boosting US troops to Afghanistan to 100,000. But many see domestic politics at work, as Mr Obama seeks to rebut criticism that he is soft on defence. The result, in the eyes of many policymakers, is a national security apparatus that favours military solutions over diplomacy – exactly the “military-industrial complex” decried by Dwight Eisenhower when president 50 years ago. “The country’s posture is gridlocked,” says Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser. “It’s like this great ship where the captain can only change course by one degree.”Mr Gates warns deep cuts would be “calamitous”. Others argue that they simply reflect a new economic reality and the constraints under which the US now operates. To keep the government running, the US has to borrow 40 cents in every dollar it spends.Mr Gates depicts past defence cuts, such as those overseen by the Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s, as mistakes that had to be rectified at great cost. A 10 per cent cut in defence would save $50bn compared with a federal budget shortfall of $1,645bn, meaning “you haven’t gotten very far toward dealing with the deficit”, he told the House armed services committee last month.…Mr Gates has tried to get ahead of the budget axe by ordering the Pentagon’s bureaucracy to find $100bn of efficiencies to invest in forces in the field. After prodding by the White House, he also agreed to cut planned spending by a further $78bn over five years, which would mean the Pentagon budget levelling off in 2015 and 2016. But that is as far as he wants to go.“With the exception of the late 1990s and the early 2000s, at 18.9 per cent, it is the lowest level of federal percentage of outlays since before world war two,” he says of the defence budget. “We still live in a very dangerous and often unstable world. We shrink from our global security responsibilities at our peril.”Indeed, many of his future savings are predicated on reductions in the size of the army in 2015, a decision the Pentagon will revisit if circumstances – notably in Afghanistan – dictate.But the debate is starting to leave defenders of the military budget behind. The fiscal crisis, and a large dose of war-weariness seeping through the system, is changing the calculus in Washington. “It is simply not credible to describe a reduction of even perhaps $23bn from the 2011 defence budget as the end of the world – it is about 3 per cent of the department’s resources last year,” says Gordon Adams, of the American University in Washington.Any conservative who questioned defence spending might once have been labelled unpatriotic. But efforts by some Republicans to quarantine the Pentagon from budget cuts have been swept aside by the party’s increasingly ascendant fiscal hawks. “I think it is now a settled issue on the right. The defence budget should be on the table, as should the entire budget,” says Grover Norquist, of Americans for Tax Reform. “There was an effort by a couple of people to say that that shouldn’t be the case but with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent, that’s just silly to say.”Thomas Donnelly, of the American Enterprise Institute, a strong supporter of defence spending, points to the new Republican-controlled House of Representatives as a big factor, with scores of new members having little exposure to national security issues. “I think the landscape is pretty clear – that in the budget, defence is just going to be treated as first among equals,” he said. “It may be nothing more than a new generation coming to grips with reality. But the fact that American strength and power require constant investment is not deeply appreciated.”Part of the culture shock for members of Congress is the inscrutability of the Pentagon’s accounts. In spite – or perhaps because – of the scale of its budget, the Pentagon does not file fully audited financial statements. Senators such as John McCain complain bitterly about the lack of competition for big defence contracts.Contractor fraud remains a big concern; an internal January report revealed that $270bn in contracts had been awarded over three years to 91 companies involved in civil fraud cases. James Amos, commandant of the US Marine Corps, says the focus on the Iraq war created a “culture of plenty”, which he is trying to overcome by getting back to his service’s “frugal roots”. Gen Amos says: “You needed something, you got it, you didn’t have to sit around and barter and say: ‘What’s more important, A or B?’ …For the last six years we’ve been able to get A and B.”Like most efforts to reduce budgets, cutting the Pentagon’s domestic and global footprint is a lot easier said than done. Mr Gates, for example said this year that “it is clear we have excess force structure in Europe”. Yet he himself halted a 2005 decision by Donald Rumsfeld, his predecessor, to bring home two of the four US brigade combat teams in Europe, which each number about 4,000 troops. Washington is now looking at the decision again and officials say one likely outcome is to withdraw just one brigade – because of the importance of reassuring European allies of American commitment – and that nothing will happen before 2015.…Numerous officials as well as outside experts say the US needs to increase its presence in Asia, to balance China’s growing influence, after 10 years in which resources were diverted to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That was the conclusion of a commission headed last year by Steve Hadley, former national security adviser, and William Perry, a former defence secretary, which also called for a larger air force and navy.They argue that such steps are necessary because of cuts that brought the number of naval ships down from 570 in 1990 to 266 today and that they need to be financed by cutting personnel costs and, if necessary, more spending. “The problem isn’t spending on areas like defence; it’s entitlements,” says Mr Hadley, arguing that the key to getting the ballooning deficit under control is reforming bigger-ticket items such as Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and health schemes.All the same, those are arguments that are unlikely to satisfy the new Republicans, nor perhaps those Democrats who have always been wary of big increases in defence spending. In January, Republican members of the House of Representatives united with Democrats to vote down $450m in 2011 spending for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, even though it was supported by John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House.Opponents including Mr Gates had been trying to kill the second engine programme for a decade. But powerful members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had kept it alive, to protect jobs in their constituencies.For the first time in more than a decade, the language of defence cuts – rather than just “savings” – is being spoken in Washington. After a decade of war, even Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, regularly says that America’s biggest national security challenge is its national debt.Some longtime observers of the Pentagon and its far-flung web of valuable interests, however, are sceptical that lessons have been learnt from the costly military build-up of the last decade. “The US is the opposite of the Balkans,” says the Lexington Institute’s Mr Thompson. “No one remembers anything.”……………………………………….Industry implicationsDefence contractors blatten down the hatches and survive the worstWhen the Pentagon said in January that it would cut $78bn from its five-year budget plan and cancelled a series of procurement projects as part of a separate $100bn efficiency drive, for defence contractors the news came as something of a relief, writes Jeremy Lemer.On the day, defence stocks rallied as much as 3 per cent, against a slight decline in the broader market. Since the start of the year, shares in Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, the sector’s big three, have climbed 5-16 per cent.The reaction reflects the poor investor sentiment that had surrounded defence groups, which compete for about $400bn of the Pentagon’s $700bn-plus annual budget. Shareholders were preparing for the worst. Over the past two years, the stocks have slid amid concerns that US military spending is set to decline as the “war on terror” winds down and the war on deficits ramps up.Relative to prospective earnings, the hit has been even harder, with defence companies trading at levels not seen since the 1990s, when the Pentagon slashed spending by more than 30 per cent in the wake of the cold war.Publicly, defence contractors have taken heart from assurances by Robert Gates, defence secretary, that internal efficiency measures and better prioritisation can free up enough cash to keep raising investment on crucial equipment. High-profile casualties, such as a $15bn “swimming tank” designed by General Dynamics for use by the marine corps in taking enemy beaches, have been offset in part by extra money for other areas such as unmanned aerial vehicles.Still, the industry outlook remains uncertain at best. Analysts note that the government’s long-term spending plans have usually been far too optimistic, and that the various reform initiatives could put pressure on contractors’ margins. At the same time, companies complain that the lack of an official 2011 defence budget – due to the fight about how to reduce the deficit – is delaying projects and hurting their businesses.Contractors have found themselves in the unfamiliar position of cutting costs and shrinking their business. Lockheed has reduced executive headcount and BAE Systems, the UK defence company, has shed thousands of workers. Northrop is spinning off its shipbuilding unit.Dave Melcher, president of ITT’s defence unit, says that his company has been preparing for more than a year. It has cut costs, diversified into non-military federal work and faster-growing niches, and expanded its services business.Mr Melcher notes that instability in the Middle East and security threats elsewhere will limit Congress’s ability to make big cuts. But even so, he expects ITT’s defence revenues will decline by about 2 per cent this year from some $5.9bn in 2010."

68;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2011-01-24T20:43:37Z;Defence groups target US military spending;;A market facing severe cuts in government spending is not usually an attractive prospect for new entrants. But, over the past month, UK companies have been rushing to grab a slice of the US defence market despite news earlier this month that US defence spending will fall by $78bn (£49bn) over five years.Last week, Meggitt agreed a £428m deal to buy Pacific Scientific Aerospace, a maker of aviation equipment, while Serco, the FTSE 100 support services specialist, made an (ultimately unsuccessful) $2bn bid for SRA International, a US defence, security and services group.They are not alone. Defence groups such as BAE Systems, Chemring and Cobham have all been increasing their exposure to the US in recent years, at a much faster pace than they have been growing in their other defence markets.As a result, in spite of the cuts that will be rolled out by the Ministry of Defence in the companies’ home market, UK defence companies still remain relatively sanguine about their future.“The US is a good place to do business for UK defence companies,” said Guy Brown, an analyst at Evolution Securities. “It’s a very big aerospace and defence market, so it has been a good source of contract and acquisition opportunities to drive growth.”BAE, Britain’s largest defence company, has led the charge into the US. In 2004, it made £4.2bn in sales to the US military and £3bn in sales to the UK. By 2009, BAE’s sales to the US military had doubled to £8.4bn while sales to the UK were up by only a third to £4.1bn.Despite the loss of US government contracts for armoured cargo carriers in 2000, that trend has continued over the past year. BAE’s sales to the US military rose 18 per cent year-on-year, while sales to the UK rose a more modest 12 per cent.Chemring – a maker of decoy devices, munitions and detection equipment – has also seen strong US growth. In 2009, sales to the US jumped 66 per cent to £236m, accounting for just under half of group revenue. The group’s Niitek division, which makes landmine detection vehicles used to counter roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been particularly successful. Sales to the UK and mainland Europe, the group’s two other large markets, have been buoyant but less rapid, up 45 per cent and 13 per cent respectively over the year.Cobham, which makes cockpit electronics and radio equipment for battlefield communication, has followed a similar path. In 2005, revenues from the US made up 40 per cent of turnover, with 20 per cent from the UK. The US now makes up 62 per cent of the group’s £1.9bn annual turnover while the UK makes up less than 10 per cent.The main attraction of the US market has been the growth in defence spending over the past 10 years. The US defence budget grew from $316bn in 2001 to $793bn in 2010.“In the UK, we had been shrinking defence budgets throughout the 1990s as did the US,” said Edward Stacey, an analyst at Execution Noble-Espirito Santo.“But we increased our budgets only slightly above inflation during the last decade so we never really recovered what we cut in the 90s, and we never funded the extra spending for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush administration, however, did recover those cuts from the 1990s. It was keen on defence spending and did a lot of it, increasing the military budget throughout the eight years of his administration.” But rather than expanding organically into the US market, UK companies have bought their way in.“This allows them to deal partly with the charge that the US is sending too many of our scarce taxpayer-provided defence dollars overseas,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a security analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “If half those dollars stay in the US, then it mitigates the concern.”The precise amount of future funding for the US defence budget remains unclear. Spending is due to increase next year, but remain flat in 2015 and 2016.That is still a far more generous settlement than was outlined in November’s Strategic Defence Review in the UK, where defence expenditure will be cut by 8 per cent over the next four years.“There are no surprises in what [Robert] Gates has said,” said Julian Hellebrand, chief of staff of Cobham. “A lot of this stuff has been trailed significantly to make sure there are no surprises. We’ll go through the detail but on an initial look through there is nothing we can see there as a clear threat to our business.”However, while the prospects for US defence spending looks relatively resilient in the near-term, there are medium-term risks.Chief among these is the fate of the military’s fleet of wheeled vehicles. Demand for so-called MRAPS – mine-resistant ambush-protected trucks – has surged due to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the need for these trucks is likely to fall after 2016, hitting a number of producers for versions of this vehicle, including BAE.Two other programmes for future vehicles – the joint light tactical vehicle (JLTV) and ground combat vehicle (GCV) – remain in place, championed by the Marines and Army respectively. But their costs may yet force US lawmakers to seek efficiencies in one or both of the programmes.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Gates details cuts to reduce costsThis month, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, announced cuts in military spending of $78bn (£49bn) over five years.While the absolute reductions in spending are large, most of the cuts will be backloaded, coming in 2014 and 2015. Mr Gates also announced that the results of an earlier efficiency drive would yield up to $100bn in savings over the period, much of which could be reassigned to other projects within the US military.In spending terms, the Gates review lays out a Pentagon budget of $553bn in 2012, a slight increase on the $534m budget for 2010. Thereafter, spending will rise by slightly less than 1 per cent in 2013 and 2014, and flatten out with no growth in 2015 and 2016.The cuts that will be made in the US military are focused on equipment and manpower. On equipment, Mr Gates announced the cancellation of General Dynamics’ $14.4bn expeditionary fighting vehicle project, which was to have built an armoured personnel carrier designed for use by the US Marine Corps in launching amphibious attacks.He also put the jump-jet-style vertical-landing version of the new joint-strike fighter on “probation”, saying this variant of the new JSF would be cancelled if technical problems could not be resolved within two years.On troop numbers, the US Army would see its ranks depleted, losing 27,000 soldiers from the 569,000 it employs. The marines would see numbers cut also, falling by between 15,000 and 20,000 from a force of 202,000. But these troop reductions will only start in 2015, a year after the expected handover to local forces in Afghanistan.

70;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-10-20T22:39:50Z;Winners and losers emerge in defence cuts;;As defence companies digest this week’s UK military budget cuts, winners and losers are beginning to materialise.Those active in cyber security and in supplying special forces equipment such as communications devices are expected to fare better than those who rely on making equipment for the handful of large programmes that are being scaled down significantly.Though this will benefit UK companies such as BAE’s Detica, Ultra Electronics and Cobham, it will also provide new opportunities for foreign companies. One example is Northrop Grumman, which has 30 years’ experience in cyber security in the US and will on Friday open the UK’s only sophisticated cyber ‘test range’ outside that of GCHQ.Ironically, many of the big UK military programmes that had been under threat but were saved will benefit big foreign companies. EADS, for example, is the lead partner in AirTanker, which will supply the UK with up to 14 aircraft capable of refuelling jet fighters in mid-air and transporting troops. The company also makes the A400M transport aircraft, which, together with the C-17, its bigger rival manufactured by Boeing of the US, was also spared.In terms of land-based vehicles, while the UK is cutting the number of its heavy tanks, maintained by BAE, it is going ahead with the Scout reconnaissance vehicles and, further down the line, the Fres, delighting General Dynamics of the US.But, like many other defence companies, General Dynamics is still far from reassured about the volumes the Ministry of Defence will now acquire, especially given the double whammy of financial constraints and general cutbacks in the sizes of all three of its military services.One of the biggest concerns is over how many Joint Strike Fighters the UK will now order given the change in the configuration of its carriers. Lockheed Martin, BAE, Pratt & Whitney and smaller providers are keenly awaiting better clarity.Meanwhile, surprisingly little has been said in the review about cost savings the MoD could make by outsourcing some of its work. So sure was Peter Rogers, chief executive of UK-based Babcock International, about the prospect of outsourcing that even before the review he predicted he would have to hire more staff and that the whole exercise would be a net positive for his company. Serco is also widely expected to benefit from outsourcing, while formerly government-owned Qinetiq is seen as one of the bigger losers, especially after having to make a £37m writedown because of the cancellation of a big training programme.“The overall challenge is a very big one. There is still a lot of significant detail to work through, not least, where precisely will the manpower reduction come from?” says Tony Poulter, partner at PwC.But clarity is expected to take months to materialise.“There’ll be continued uncertainty at least until the defence industrial strategy review in early 2011, given that the SDSR did not specify by how much it would be cutting some programmes, such as the JSF, or explain to what extent it would be renegotiating contracts and changing the way it will agree new ones,” said Jeremy Bragg, analyst at Citi.Executives fear that just cutting the numbers of MoD procurement staff, without a complete revamp, would further slow the process, rather than fix it.
71;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Lockheed warns on spending squeeze;;"The long-awaited squeeze on US defence budgets is taking hold and will restrain revenues and crimp profits in 2011, says Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company by revenues.Reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, Lockheed said it had experienced “numerous delays” to key projects such as the
terminal high-altitude area defence anti-missile system and the littoral combat ship.It is competing with General Dynamics to build the first tranche of close-to-shore vessels, which could be worth about $6bn, but the programme is about six months behind schedule.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said Lockheed’s attempts to break into adjacent markets, such as the solar energy industry, had been delayed, with the result that 2011 revenues would probably grow in the low single-digits range and profits would be flat.The results came as the UK government revealed plans to buy cheaper versions of Lockheed’s flagship F-35 combat jet, because of cuts to its defence budget.Mr Tanner said the UK move would affect Lockheed, but analysts said the long-term impact would be muted because the US plans to buy more than 2,400 aircraft.After years of rapid growth to fund overseas wars, US defence companies have been preparing for a slowdown in spending in the face of growing national debt and the drawdown of international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.In the US, administration planning calls for modest growth to the $560bn base budget, but procurement spending is being edged out by rising healthcare and maintenance costs, forcing an efficiency drive to free up money for new kit.“Lockheed clearly has some challenges ahead,” said Rob Stallard, with
RBC Capital Markets. “The organic outlook is flat (excluding F-35) and margins are under pressure.”He said pension concerns were also weighing on the company’s stock.For the three months to the end of September, revenues rose 6 per cent to $11.4bn compared with the same period in 2009, although analysts had been expecting sales of about $11.6bn.Net income from continuing operations slid from $786m to $565m, giving earnings per share of $1.55, against $2.04 in the third quarter of 2009, including the impact of one-off redundancy charges and broadly in line with consensus market forecasts.Operating margins also slipped from 11.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent and the backlog of orders continued to fall, dropping from $72.8bn in the second quarter of 2010 to $70.5bn in the third quarter.For the full year, Lockheed now expects sales
of between $44.9bn and $45.9bn, $600m lower than its previous estimates, reflecting the disposal of its Enterprise Integration Group, a consultancy unit, which had revenues of about that amount."

Cairn’s own guidance suggests about a one-in-10 chance of success at each well.Yet the discovery of uncommercial levels of gas in its first Greenland well “adds weight to evidence of a working petroleum system in the basin”, said analyst Melanie Savage. “The basin should not be written off as gas prone.”UBS noted the possibility of a counterbid from ONGC for Cairn India, which Cairn has agreed to sell to Vedanta Resources for up to $8.5bn.The broker raised its stance on Cairn shares to “buy”, with a 515p target price.The FTSE 100 ended lower by 46.55 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5,109.40. Mining stocks were the main weight as weak US housing data sent copper prices to a four-week low.BHP Billiton lost 2 per cent to £17.67 after its annual earnings came in slightly below consensus forecasts. Rio Tinto was 1.8 per cent weaker at £31.05 even after Tom Albanese, chief executive, played down talk the group could make a counterbid against BHP for PotashCorp.Anglo American retreated 2.8 per cent to £22.54 and Kazakhmys slid 2.7 per cent to £10.73. Antofagasta lost 3.4 per cent to £10.21 after Goldman Sachs moved from “conviction buy” to “neutral” in a results review.BP faded 0.6 per cent to 375p amid worries that a new US safety regime could delay the reopening of the Gulf of Mexico to deep-water oil exploration for at least a year.Analysts noted talk that BP was bidding in the latest round of auctions for exploration blocks offshore Greenland.“BP’s participation in the new round is, to say the least, controversial,” said RBC. “Similar to other jurisdictions with offshore prospects, it will undoubtedly face intense scrutiny following the Gulf oil spill.”Tullow Oil dropped 4.6 per cent to £12.38 after the group said the selling off of stakes in its Lake Albert prospect may be delayed due to a tax dispute with the Ugandan government.Tullow also said its drilling off Ghana’s coast was running late and released what Deutsche Bank called “wide-ranging downgrades to pre-drill resource guidance”.Aggreko, one of the year’s top performers so far, dropped 5.8 per cent to £13.46 on profit-taking after the generator hire group’s half-year results matched expectations. Numis Securities moved to a “reduce” rating on valuation grounds and said further forecast upgrades were unlikely without increased capital expenditure.Better-than-expected interim earnings lifted support services company Serco to the top of the Footsie risers, up 4.8 per cent to 586½p. Forecast-beating numbers also boosted insurer Admiral Group, up 2.7 per cent to £15.12.Among the mid-caps, Xchanging fell 10.8 per cent to 110p after a conference call aimed at easing concerns about the support services group’s accounting policies had the opposite effect. Talk that management was buying stock did not help either.A downgrade to “underweight” by Morgan Stanley sent Drax Group, the power station owner, down 1.2 per cent to 385½p. Drax’s investment in biomass, a renewable energy source, does not currently stack up economically and the shares are already pricing in a full recovery in wholesale electricity prices, it said.Insulation supplier SIG rallied 2.5 per cent to 93p on in-line results and a Citigroup upgrade to “buy”.Promethean World rallied 4.9 per cent to 124¾p in the wake of Tuesday’s poorly received maiden results from the electronic whiteboard maker.JPMorgan Cazenove blamed the sell-off on management’s cautious tone and limited visibility, although it saw long-term market growth as intact and said the stock was pricing in overly bearish expectations.IQE, the supplier of silicon wafers for the world’s largest chipmakers, added 3.1 per cent to 25p after Canaccord Genuity raised its target price to 30p in the wake of strong figures from Avago Technologies, one of IQE’s American rivals.“We believe IQE’s revenue growth may exceed expectations and match the growth of its publicly listed key customers,” the broker said.Management Consulting Group eased 0.1 per cent to 24½p, even after PwC acquired a Nasdaq-listed US rival called Diamond Management & Technology Consultants for $378m in cash. Based on the price paid for Diamond, traders said MCG was worth between 79p and 97p a share.Sausage-skin maker Devro drifted 2 per cent to 232¾p before its promotion to the FTSE 250 tomorrow, taking the place of transport company Arriva, which has been acquired by Deutsche Bahn. Traders reckon tracker funds will need to buy about 500,000 shares – about twice the daily average volume.Film studio Pinewood Shepperton added 4.4 per cent to 180p on news that revenues for 2010 would exceed market expectations.Bellzone Minerals rose 7 per cent to 50p after the sales desk of a leading US bank said that there was 400 per cent upside in the share price of the African iron-ore explorer.“We think the shares could hit 200p within 12 months,” the broker said. “There could be substantial upside beyond this on a two-to-three-year view.”Bellzone is developing the potentially huge Kalia Iron Mine in the Republic of Guinea.Chime Communications, the marketing services group, climbed 9.6 per cent to 200p after half-year results impressed.“We were encouraged to see that the company had the best first-half new-business performance in its history and that 91 per cent of 2010 operating income is now committed,” said Numis Securities.
73;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-07-27T15:28:33Z;Lockheed reports rise in profits;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor by revenues, on Tuesday reported second-quarter results that beat analysts’ earnings estimates but fell slightly short of forecasts for revenues.In recent months, defence stocks have slumped on fears that the growing fiscal deficit in the US will force the government to sharply cut defence spending, and efforts to reform the Department of Defense will cut into contractor margins.In response, Lockheed executives have attempted to prepare the company, and its shareholders, for what Bob Stevens, chief executive, has described as the “new reality of escalating demands and increasing constraints on resources”.Last month the company said it would sell two of its non-core business units and reorganise two others in an effort to reshape its portfolio to prepare for tougher contracting rules and tighter defence budgets.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said the company had received dozens of expressions of interest from private equity and strategic buyers but was now looking at spinning off rather than selling one of the units for tax reasons.Lockheed said it would hold on to Enterprise Integration Group, which offers systems engineering services to the US defence department, until “we either conclude that a sale is probable or close a spin-off transaction”.In the three months to the end of June, net profits rose to $825m, from $724 in the same period in 2009. Earnings per share from continuing operations climbed to $2.22, up from $1.88 in 2009, thanks to about $782m of share buy backs.Sales rose 3 per cent to $11.4bn but analysts were expecting earnings per share of about $1.78 on sales of about $11.5bn.The company’s backlog of work fell to $72.8bn from $77.5bn in the same period in 2009 but Mr Tanner said that was largely because of the timing of certain contract awards and forecast that the backlog would be up to about $78bn by the end of the year.Beneath the headline numbers the results were mixed. At Lockheed’s key aeronautics unit operating profits fell 7 per cent to $372m as it received fewer favourable performance awards on legacy programmes such as the F-22 fighter jet after a strong year in 2009.Mr Tanner said that contract negotiations for the fourth production lot of the F-35 fighter jet, which is the DoD’s largest ever procurement project and Lockheed’s biggest programme, were also taking longer than expected.In an effort to head off concerns about escalating costs and poor performance, Lockheed has agreed to a fixed price contract for the batch of aircraft, but Mr Tanner noted that this had added “complexity” to the negotiating process.Lockheed’s outlook for the year remained essentially unchanged although the headline revenue forecast dipped by about $750m to take into account the planned sale of Pacific Architects and Engineers, a defence and infrastructure services company.For the full year, Lockheed expects sales of $46.3bn-$47.3bn and earnings per share of $7.15-$7.35, slightly higher than previously forecast on the back of more extensive share repurchases than originally planned.Lockheed shares, which have fallen 13 per cent in the past three months, were unchanged in early trading. General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman all report later in the week.
74;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-07-20T19:19:27Z;Northrop gets ready to deliver performance;;Northrop Grumman’s shipbuilding operations could have a viable future as a standalone business, according to Wes Bush, the company’s new chief executive.Mr Bush surprised the defence industry earlier this month when he announced that Northrop, which together with General Dynamics, dominates the shipbuilding market for the US Navy, was exploring “strategic alternatives” for the business.He said the company would “conduct a process where both financial buyers and strategic buyers will be considered”.“It is a substantial business with $6bn in annual sales. There are quite a few defence names in our industry that are smaller than that,” he told the Financial Times at the Farnborough Air Show.The decision to reconsider the company’s investment in shipbuilding is the latest high-profile move by Mr Bush since he took over as chief executive of the defence contractor in January.He has already announced that the company’s headquarters is moving from Los Angeles to Washington, DC – closer to the Pentagon, and pulled out of the contest to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force. The moves have been widely seen by industry watchers as a sign that Mr Bush is looking to reinvigorate the company and focus on shareholder returns over revenue growth.Earlier this year, he laid out an ambitious plan to increase margins across all of its business units this year. According to Mr Bush, these moves are simply the next steps in the evolution of the defence group.Northrop was built up through acquisitions by Kent Kresa, he notes, and Ron Sugar (who Mr Bush succeeded) then went on to integrate those purchases. The next step for the company, he said, was to “really drive performance”.For shareholders, he said, increased performance would translate into “improved profitability” as well as “decreased volatility”.“Over the last set of years we have had a set of programme charges that reflected [that volatility].”For government customers, meanwhile, driving performance would translate into “programme performance”, which is key in the current environment where budgets are tighter and affordability is critical.Given the flattening budgets, he said, companies would have to respond and address their cost structures.The decision to consider alternatives for the shipbuilding business has been driven by “what we see to be the demand”.With demand for new ships from the government slowing, there is simply too much capacity around. Would he find a buyer for it given the market pressures? He insisted it was a good business with “a very long transparency in terms of the order book”.Northrop’s other four areas of focus – aerospace, electronics, information systems and technical services – all “work together intimately, exchange ideas” and are able to create value that way. Shipbuilding is not a part of that, he said.The US government has already warned that the “gusher” of military spending has been turned off. Against this backdrop, like most of his peers, Mr Bush is targeting key growth areas.He expects future growth will come from intelligence and security, cybersecurity, unmanned systems (the company makes the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle) and logistics.Northrop will look at potential acquisitions in those areas, although, “We feel pretty good about the portfolio … We don’t feel we have a strategic gap that we have to address.”
75;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-06-01T21:09:32Z;MoD savings drive to hit equipment;;"The Ministry of Defence is set to review about 20 equipment procurement projects, worth £10bn in total, as part of its drive to cut costs.The move follows a statement by the Treasury last month that all large procurement decisions announced by the previous Labour government that required the department’s approval would have to be re-submitted.Any decisions are likely to pre-empt the strategic defence and security review, which could anger those defence contractors affected.The cuts could help Liam Fox, defence secretary, reduce the estimated £36bn deficit facing the department over the next 10 years.But any savings are unlikely to be immediate.High-profile programmes expected to be reviewed include a contract to an industry consortium comprising Thales UK, Royal Bank of Scotland and CHC, a helicopter operator, to take over civil search-and-rescue missions; a contract to build the army’s next reconnaissance vehicle awarded to General Dynamics of the US; a contract to buy three Rivet Joint aircraft from the US government to replace the RAF’s Nimrod R1 signals intelligence planes; and an order for extra Chinook transport helicopters from Boeing of the US.In the meantime, Mr Fox has some other options in his arsenal that do not involve cutting equipment programmes.Top of these is outsourcing – in various forms. The government-commissioned DeAnne Julius report in July 2008 estimated that services outsourced to the private sector could generate savings of 20 per cent. Last year’s review of the MoD’s acquisition processes by Bernard Gray, a former ministerial adviser, also championed the benefits of outsourcing.Within the MoD, previous rounds of outsourcing have in some cases seen costs cut by a gross 35-40 per cent and, allowing for a 10-15 per cent margin to the companies, that would see net cost reductions to the government of about 25 per cent: “Unmissable in the current climate,” says a long-term defence watcher.Possible contenders, according to a Financial Times poll of industry executives, advisers and defence experts, include:• Outsourcing the management of Defence Estates, the arm of the MoD that runs its huge property holdings.• Privatising or outsourcing parts of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the civilian manned fleet that supplies warships with fuel, food stores and ammunition.• Privatising the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (was on a previous Treasury list of potential privatisations).• Privatising the Defence Support Group, which provides maintenance, repair and support services for the Armed Forces’ air and land systems.Another area is the Tri-Service Whole Fleet Management, which expertly stores and maintains equipment not being used for current operations such as Challenger tanks. The MoD police, which guards facilities among other things, is another contender.Mr Fox could also close some bases and sell off the land.Defence experts say there are a host of other fleet management and project management contracts that could be outsourced. Several communication contracts are also coming up for renewal and could be re-negotiated or axed.More money could also be saved from further outsourcing of the support and maintenance of equipment but equally the Armed Forces will be wary of losing any technical expertise.However, notwithstanding the government’s eagerness to cut costs and support service companies’ desire to win lucrative contracts, most of the easy things have probably already been done.There are also inherent challenges associated with outsourcing, not least the cost to companies of taking on expensive public-sector type pension commitments."
76;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-05-03T23:07:08Z;Jet prices: Market split overshadows optimism;;Order cancellations and hundred-million dollar revenue falls are never good news. But for Cessna and the business jet market, they are, perversely, a sign of slow improvement.In the first quarter of the year revenues at Cessna, the leading business jet maker, tumbled by almost 50 per cent to $433m and the order backlog fell 17 per cent to $4.1bn, as cancellations continued to come in.The company, owned by industrial group Textron, reported an operating loss of $24m for the three months to end-March. In the same period of 2009, it made an operating profit of $90m.Still, Scott Donnelly, the new chief executive of Textron, was cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the business jet market was heading towards a turn and that revenues, of which Cessna makes up about a third, had bottomed out.Shares in Textron, which also owns Bell Helicopter, jumped more than 12 per cent on the day of the results.“World economies generally appear to be recovering,” he said. “We believe the economic trend will translate to an eventual rebound in orders for business jets and commercial helicopters.”He said official data showed people were flying more in their business jets, that corporate profits were up and that Cessna was seeing more prospective buyers taking demonstration rides.According to UBS, 2,704 used business jets were available for sale at the end of March, or about 15 per cent of the total operating fleet, down 12 per cent from the peak in May 2009. In January, Cowen and Company noted that US business jet departures rose 10 per cent.“Clearly, the past 18 months have been difficult … but the increased level of sales activity towards the end of the quarter bodes well for this industry to start to turn,” Mr Donnelly said.Difficult is perhaps an understatement.In 2007, business jet makers seemed unstoppable, as deliveries surged to more than 1,000 for the first time and then rose again in 2008. Cessna and its peers, Gulfstream, owned by General Dynamics, Bombardier and others, planned for growth.By 2009, however, the bottom had fallen out of the market, as the global economic downturn and a wave of adverse public sentiment took their toll.Cash-strapped companies and individuals looked to sell assets and used business jets flooded the market. At the low point in May, almost 18 per cent of the entire fleet of business jets was up for sale and prices fell more than 50 per cent.With used jets in abundance, deliveries of new aircraft plunged. Last year, the business jet industry delivered 870 aircraft worth about $17.3bn, down 34 per cent on the previous year.To cope, Cessna cut its 16,000-strong workforce in half, slashed its production rates and began to move work to lower-cost locations. Hawker Beechcraft and other rivals also cut jobs.The recovery has been slow, says Brian Foley, an industry consultant. “The good news is that for a while we drove off a cliff and were bouncing off the rocks below. But now there seems to be some stability forming in the market.”The latest data from UBS, however, suggests that the outlook is fragile. In March, prices continued to fall in three out of six categories of used aircraft and a market survey showed sentiment had stalled after improving for eight months.Moreover, the market has begun to fracture – seemingly splitting in two as the recovery takes hold, says Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Company.Larger aircraft made by companies such as Gulfstream have recovered strongly. Used models are in short supply, thanks to interest from international customers who want long-range aircraft, rich individuals and private companies.At Gulfstream, orders for large-cabin aircraft improved steadily throughout 2009, and the company is predicting a low to mid single-digit increase in revenues in 2010 and a slight bump to profit margins.The market for mid-sized jets, however, remains weak and General Dynamics does not see any recovery in 2010. Inventories of secondhand short- and medium-range planes remain elevated at 17 and 15 per cent of the fleet, compared with a norm of about 12 per cent.“In Cessna’s markets there are still good used planes available and its competitors have also been dropping their prices.” Mr Rumohr says. “Also, more of their buyers are publicly owned US companies that have been under pressure.”Some analysts worry that any bounceback in the market as a whole will be muted.“Between 2006 and 2008, credit was very loose and half of all business jets were financed, many with deals including zero per cent down and low rates,” says Mr Foley. “That is all gone now. Lenders are asking for 20 to 30 per cent down now.”At the same time, companies such as NetJets that stimulated the market by selling fractions of aircraft are trying to repair their balance sheets and are not adding new jets, removing another key driver of demand.In his 10-year forecast, Mr Foley paints an attractive picture. Manufacturers will sell 8,900 business jets worth about $170bn, but annual sales will be limited.“It is going to be a modest rise – 2.5 per cent – a year and [in the 10 years] it will not quite reach where it was in 2008.”

78;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-04-27T18:28:27Z;BAE aims to expand US ship repair operations;;BAE Systems has stepped up plans to expand its ship repair operations in the US and recently held talks to buy Atlantic Marine, a business owned by JF Lehman, the private equity group.A deal, which could be worth between $200m and $400m, would add Atlantic Marine’s four shipyards along the US Gulf coast and east coast to BAE’s operations.Europe’s largest defence contractor is the US’s leading provider of non-nuclear ship repair, conversion and overhaul for government and commercial customers. It has made no secret of its aim to expand operations.BAE’s interest in Atlantic Marine goes back several years. It is understood to have been among potential buyers two years ago when JF Lehman unsuccessfully conducted a formal sales process.Industry sources familiar with the situation said that although there was no formal process under way, BAE had held discussions with JF Lehman but that price remained an issue.However, an agreement could still happen. BAE has ample headroom for bolt-on acquisitions. It ended 2009 with net cash of £403m ($615m) and although it has launched a £500m share buy-back, its business is very cash-generative.Jim McAleese, a defence consultant, said ship repair was a growth area in the US as operations placed greater strain on ships and the navy took on new roles such as missile defence.At the same time the navy is set to shrink in size in line with a more moderate procurement programme set out by a cost-conscious Pentagon that focuses less on expensive new ships and more on legacy designs.Large-scale naval projects such as the CG(X) next generation cruiser initiative have been cancelled in favour of legacy hulls.In recent years, BAE has won a large chunk of US Navy ship repair work. Earlier this year, it won a contract worth up to $500m to modernise 11 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers.Some analysts believe BAE might at some point also be keen to add a shipbuilding capacity in the US.Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics currently dominate the market and there has been speculation BAE was interested in buying Northrop’s shipyards.JF Lehman, which was founded by John Lehman, a former US Navy secretary in the Reagan administration of the 1980s, bought Atlantic Marine in 2006 from a private owner in a deal said to have valued it at about $170m. JF Lehman has since completed two bolt-on acquisitions.BAE and JF Lehman both declined to comment.
79;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-28T22:13:58Z;Politics takes back seat as projects roll;;Transport officials in the West Midlands expressed surprise when the government approved a £127m scheme to extend a tram line serving Birmingham and the Black Country. They had believed that a decision on the scheme, which will require public investment of up to £81m, had been postponed until after the general election.“It is good news that the government has brought this announcement forward,” said Geoff Inskip, chief executive of Centro, the West Midlands transport authority, “If we can get procurement tenders out this year we should be on site in 2013 and finish the scheme in 2015.”Mr Inskip is not the only one surprised. Government approval for the scheme is part of a £7bn flurry of pre-election investment announcements for regional projects in transport, industry, defence and regeneration that have provoked Conservative claims that Labour is bribing voters with taxpayers’ money.Local officials will not worry about the politics if it advances long-cherished schemes. In Birmingham, trams stop short of the city centre, which contrasts oddly with systems in Manchester and Nottingham that extend to main shopping areas. The extension to New Street station, itself undergoing a £600m facelift, is part of a transport upgrade supported strongly by regional business.The West Midlands is dotted with Labour marginals challenged by the Tories. However, final approval for the tram extension will depend on “availability of funds”, according to the Department for Transport, a significant rider given the fiscal austerity that a government of any political hue will need to pursue. The scheme will also have to pass through at least two further approval stages.Farther north, Leeds received approval in principle for a £254m trolleybus scheme – with the government providing £235m – almost five years after ministers dismissed the city’s scheme as too expensive.Sadiq Khan, the transport minister, also said the government would set aside up to £331m for new roads to reduce congestion around the ports of Hull and Immingham and held out the prospect of abolition of Humber Bridge tolls.That would please people living across the river in Cleethorpes and Brigg and Goole, Labour marginals in the top 100 of Conservative targets. Local businesses have been hit hard by business rate increases that have tipped some into administration.There has been a series of announcements about improving transport links in north-west England, a key election battleground. All came after long campaigns by local authorities.The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency will invest more than £66m to strengthen the Bidston Moss viaduct on the Wirral. Residents of South Wirral, a Labour-held marginal, who commute to Liverpool will benefit.Eight extra carriages are being provided on Northern Rail routes serving Liverpool and Manchester, providing capacity for more than 1,000 extra passengers coming into the cities in the morning rush hour at a cost of £17.8m. Eight more carriages will double the length of almost all East Midlands Trains services into the cities.The government also announced £120.9m funding for two extensions to the Manchester tram system, to Ashton-under-Lyne and East Didsbury. This will help to double capacity on the congested network.In the north-east, apart from a £580m revamp for Tyne and Wear’s Metro – benefiting marginal Tynemouth and other Labour constituencies – Tees Valley will get £57m to improve bus services. That helps an area hit by the mothballing of Corus’s Teesside Cast Products steelworks and where Labour’s Stockton South seat could be vulnerable.The Conservatives were angered last week by defence announcements, including a £1bn-plus order for army reconnaissance vehicles from the US’s General Dynamics, a £127m contract for BAE Systems to develop frigates and £300m for BAE to build two nuclear submarines.While the GD contract threatens jobs at BAE’s Newcastle plant, it secures or creates more than 10,000 elsewhere, including 450 in Wales, where the Tories could take several Labour seats. Peter Hain, the Welsh secretary, said it was a “win, win for Wales”.The BAE contracts, along with a 15-year “partnering agreement” for Babcock International to maintain nuclear submarines and ships, will safeguard or create jobs in Barrow-in-Furness, Bristol and Plymouth – all with Labour marginals – as well as Glasgow and Portsmouth.Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, has brushed aside Tory complaints that he is reverting to an old-style “picking winners” strategy with his policy of industrial activism.“The question is what would David Cameron do? Revert to the fatalism and free-market dogma of the past 30 years or do what governments need to do to ensure economic success?” he said.
80;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-25T03:43:47Z;Ministers set for naval spending spree;;Ministers are poised to sign off on a pre-election spending spree for the Royal Navy, including committing to two further Astute-class nuclear submarines.The move is likely to infuriate the opposition, which has warned against procurement contracts being placed so close to the election.It will come less than 24 hours after the Ministry of Defence promised in the Budget to generate £120m worth of savings from cheaper procurement.The department, which has so far contracted to buy four of the new submarines from BAE Systems, is expected to announce on Thursday that it intends to proceed with a fifth and a sixth boat although it will stop shy of awarding a build contract.There had been concerns that the programme, which initially envisaged seven vessels and has been battling rising costs since its inception, could be at risk from the outcome of a strategic defence review, planned after the election.The MoD is also expected to award BAE a £120m ($179m) development contract for a new class of frigates destined to replace the Navy’s Type 22 and Type 23 ships.The moves are likely to draw fire from Liam Fox, the shadow defence secretary, who has attacked the department’s recent procurement decisions, notably Monday’s announcement that it was going ahead with a major army contract.He branded Labour a “bankrupt shopaholic on one last spending binge before jail, spending taxpayers’ money which they hope not to be responsible for”.The news will be a boost for BAE as it comes just days after it lost out to General Dynamics, a US rival, in a competition to build a new reconnaissance vehicle for the army.It will also be good news for BAE’s submarine yard at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria and a boost for the navy – and it will help safeguard jobs in key constituencies for Labour.BAE announced in February that it planned to cut 230 jobs in its submarine business as it tried to keep costs down to meet the requirements of the MoD, although it said at the time it was still seeking to hire about 170 skilled engineers to work on the Astute programme.The first boat, HMS Astute, was handed over to the Royal Navy late last year, the first new class of submarine launched for 17 years.The nuclear-powered attack vessels, which will replace the Trafalgar class submarines, are the most technologically advanced nuclear submarines in the world with a sonar capable of tracking ship movements across thousands of miles. Their top speed is a state secret but they will dive deeper than 300 metres and can run 25 years without refuelling. They are designed to work alongside Trident.Separately, Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, is expected to receive a contract to support and maintain engines on Tornado jets for the Royal Air Force.
81;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-22T15:55:19Z;US rival beats BAE to army vehicle contract;;Quentin Davies, arms procurement minister said on Monday that BAE Systems had lost out on all counts in a competition with General Dynamics, a US rival, to build the army’s next reconnaissance vehicle.Dismissing the controversy over a fiercely contested potential £4bn contract that involved BAE directly lobbying the prime minister, Mr Davies told the Financial Times it was a “relatively easy decision to take” that would create jobs in Britain.“We looked at performance, the prospects to enhance that performance, the cost and the through-life cost and it was a clear win by GD on all counts,” he said.Mr Davies also said General Dynamics had scored better than BAE in the amount of production that would be based in the UK, though that was not decisive. GD said 80 per cent of the full rate production of its vehicle would be based in the UK, securing or creating more than 10,600 jobs.The decision to pick GD over BAE means the latter will now go ahead with 500 redundancies in the UK, notably at its plant in Newcastle, which has been designing and making tanks since the first world war.The Newcastle site now faces closure because from the middle of next year it will have only one manufacturing order – 60 Terrier vehicles, concluding in 2014. Closure of the site will mean the UK has no heavy vehicle armaments manufacturing capability left.The Conservatives condemned the award. Liam Fox, shadow defence secretary, said it was “quite wrong” for the government to sign such expensive contracts just weeks before a general election.“Whatever the merits of the programme, it does not make sense to commit to it so close to an SDSR [strategic defence and security review] which will look at every aspect of Britain’s defence and national security. Labour is now like a bankrupt shopaholic on one last spending binge before jail, spending taxpayers’ money which they hope not to be responsible for,” he said.Mr Davies rejected the criticism, branding it “unbelievably irresponsible”. “We need to get this capability to the armed forces as quickly as possible,” he said.There will, however, be some good news for BAE over the coming days. The company is to be awarded a £100m assessment phase contract to build the navy’s replacement for its type 22 and 23 frigates.The government also said it would buy three Rivet Joint aircraft from the US government to replace the RAF’s Nimrod R1 signals intelligence planes. However, the MoD said it was delaying a plan to upgrade the army’s Warrior infantry fighting vehicles.
82;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-17T22:58:04Z;Brown admits defence budget error;The prime minister makes a humbling retreat;Gordon Brown on Wednesday executed a humbling retreat over defence spending, admitting that he bungled his statistics and misled the Iraq inquiry on the budgets for the armed forces.The prime minister, succumbing to weeks of political pressure, told the Commons he was wrong to claim the defence budget rose in real terms every year since 1997. He said: “I do accept that in one or two years defence expenditure did not rise.”Conservative leader David Cameron seized on the admission as evidence that he had been “found out misleading the House and the Chilcot Inquiry”. “We now know the truth,” Mr Cameron said. “Whilst soldiers were at war he was cutting the defence budget. It is no wonder he was so reluctant to admit it.”The rare mea culpa will be a serious political setback for Mr Brown, who has striven to contain any electoral fall-out from allegations of underfunding defence during wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.While the climbdown is mainly over the details of the budget – which increased by 12 per cent in real terms – it will provide the Tories with ammunition to campaign on his allegedly thrifty approach to the armed forces. Mr Brown prepared intensely for four days before the Iraq inquiry, memorising reams of statistics and hauling in Treasury officials to explain the fine details of resource accounting. Aides insist he only realised his mistake on Monday night.In five hours of questioning before the inquiry, he repeated two points: that the defence budget rose “every year” in real terms and that no frontline request for kit was rejected.However, it emerged that in four years – 1997-98, 1999-00, 2004-05 and 2006-07 – Mr Brown oversaw a real terms fall in defence spending. Mr Brown insists that this was mainly because the Ministry of Defence either underspent, shifted funds, or suffered from higher than expected inflation.In a letter last night to Sir John Chilcot to provide “further detail”, Mr Brown said that after 2002 he awarded the MoD a “rising profile” of core funding that was supplemented with extra funding for operations.Defying calls to express his regret over the error, Mr Brown offered no apology and did not admit to making a mistake in his evidence to the inquiry.Former defence chiefs, including Lord Boyce and Lord Guthrie, attacked his testimony as being misleading, primarily because it gave an incomplete picture of the longer-term crisis in defence funding.While Mr Brown was technically correct in arguing that he met the direct cost of operations, they argue that this short-term spending can never compensate for shortfalls in equipment such as helicopters, which take years to buy and put into service.Aides to Mr Brown deny he misled the Commons since the Iraq inquiry, as he said the defence budget “is” rising in real terms rather than “did”. They insist the prime minister took the earliest opportunity to correct his statements after being informed of his mistake.The admission came in response to a question from Tony Baldry, the Conservative MP for Banbury. Congratulating the backbencher, Mr Cameron said: “In three years of asking the prime minister questions I don’t think I’ve ever heard him making a correction or retraction”.
83;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-14T21:16:04Z;BAE in late bid for £1bn Scout contract;;BAE Systems will on Monday make a last-ditch bid to build the army’s next generation of Scout armoured vehicle, presenting a new offer to create jobs in Newcastle if ministers overturn a decision on the contract.Quentin Davies, defence minister, is set to announce General Dynamics as the winner of a fierce competition worth more than £1bn to build an initial batch of about 750 vehicles, which the US company says will sustain thousands of jobs in Britain.The decision to opt for GD and to delay plans to upgrade the Warrior armoured vehicle are a severe setback for BAE, which saw both contracts as essential for the survival of its British armoured vehicle business.In a last throw of the dice, BAE has told the Ministry of Defence that it will revise the terms of its bid, consolidating the production work in Newcastle – a move that would cancel 400 redundancies and create 400 additional jobs.BAE has in the past year announced the closure of three land-vehicle manufacturing plants and several hundred job losses. Its original bid planned to equip the Scout in Sweden and assemble turrets for it and the Warrior at a new site in Donnington.However, defence insiders expect new proposals from BAE to make little or no difference to the final decision, which was formally evaluated by the MoD and signed-off by ministers. Given the financial constraints on the MoD and operational demands of the army, senior figures involved with the decision said they no longer had the luxury of making decisions purely on the basis of where jobs were created.The contract will close the chapter on Britain’s pioneering history in the design and manufacture of tanks. Under both bids for the Scout, future British armoured vehicles will use chassis bought from overseas but customised for the army in Britain. BAE is currently building the Terrier vehicle, the last wholly British-designed and built armoured fighting vehicle.Alan Garwood, BAE business development director, said: “We want the army to have the best kit and we want to protect vital skills in the UK. To achieve this we are offering to transfer manufacturing work on [the vehicles] to Newcastle, which will sustain or create 800 skilled jobs and manufacturing work there until at least 2020.”
84;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-03-12T23:01:38Z;BAE loses to US in £1bn UK army ‘Scout’ race;;BAE Systems has lost the race to build the British army’s next generation of “Scout” armoured vehicles, beaten by General Dynamics of the US in the competition for a contract worth more than £1bn.The US company’s victory is a heavy blow for BAE and will put at risk jobs at the UK company’s armaments division.Quentin Davies, defence minister, is shortly expected to name General Dynamics as the preferred bidder in the deal to build an initial 750 vehicles.However, there will be a delay of at least a year for a planned upgrade of the Warrior armoured vehicle.The delay to the Warrior upgrade is the result of a “funding gap” that has emerged because of the Scout procurement and some doubts over the maturity of the technology. But defence officials insist the programme will still go ahead and that the “slippage” will only be short term.The contest to supply the armoured reconnaissance vehicles is central to the future of Britain’s armoured vehicle industry and BAE’s business.BAE, which has already announced the closure of three land-vehicle manufacturing plants and several hundred job losses over the past year, needed to win the two contests. It might have to cut more jobs.The company had pledged to create jobs if it won the contest by opening a site near Donnington. GD has said winning the competition would create and sustain 10,500 UK jobs. But BAE has also said it would have to take another “look at restructuring in the UK” if it failed to win the Scout contract and Warrior upgrade.

86;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-02-18T20:47:07Z;Route ahead lies across rough terrain;;Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, has had 15 challenging months at the head of Europe’s largest defence contractor. But the next few years could prove even tougher.With government defence budgets under pressure in the UK and the US, two of BAE’s largest customers, Mr King will need to ensure the company has placed its bets – and its cash – in areas and countries where spending will still rise.The comparison with the past will be painful. BAE has grown rapidly in the past few years. Big acquisitions in 2005 and 2007 and big government spending on armoured trucks and mine-resistant vehicles for Afghanistan have driven growth. BAE’s land and armaments business, which builds the vehicles, has been the star performer.All that is about to change. On Thursday, at its annual results presentation, although BAE said it expected growth across most of its businesses in 2010, it warned the focus would be on reducing costs.“Defence budgets in the UK and the US are expected to come under further pressure, and with the expectations of a more challenging business environment ahead, the focus on driving performance and efficiency in the business will be key. Cost reduction measures are being aggressively implemented across the group.”The results were also accompanied by a £973m ($1.52bn) non-cash impairment charge largely because of the loss of a contract to supply trucks to the US army . Oshkosh won the contract. Mr King warned that BAE did not expect growth from its land and armaments business in 2010. Return on sales will improve, however, but only as cost-cutting takes effect.Uncertainty also surrounds the company’s UK land business where BAE is competing for a £2bn armoured vehicle contract from the ministry of defence. The company has already announced the closure of three land facilities along with several hundred job losses in the past year.The question for investors is where growth will come from next.Mr King insists BAE has a “pretty robust order book” – orders were £46.9bn last year – and argues that other parts of the company’s portfolio will pick up the slack from the armaments business. He picks out BAE’s combat aircraft business which helps build the Eurofighter Typhoon and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft jets.European partner governments last year committed themselves to half of the final production run of Typhoon aircraft which should sustain production at BAE’s plants until at least 2018. Growth should also come from the F-35 programme. Despite doubts about how many aircraft the UK government will order, BAE has a 17 per cent share of the programme to produce the 3,000 or so aircraft on order from all customer governments, including the US.Mr King also picks out the rising level of orders from providing maintenance and support on equipment, with about £3bn worth of new orders booked last year. About 40 per cent of the company’s 2009 sales were related to maintenance contracts.With the US government in particular focusing its spending priorities on new areas such as cyber warfare, BAE expects future growth from orders of electronic systems and unmanned aerial vehicles.Nick Cunningham at Evolution Securities describes what is happening at BAE as a “relay race” where each of BAE’s four main divisions picks up the baton to drive growth in turn.Now that the armaments business has dropped back, BAE’s programmes and support business, which includes combat aircraft and long-term UK programmes such as submarines and aircraft carriers, will take up the baton, he argues. BAE’s international business, including its Saudi Arabian business, should pick up sharply in the next few years.The Saudi business – notably sales of Eurofighter – accounted for about £2bn of BAE’s group operating sales last year. Mr Cunningham expects that to rise to about £4bn in four to five years time as BAE begins to deliver more Typhoons and support those already in the country.But long-term company watchers are nevertheless warning investors not to expect a repeat of the dramatic growth of recent years.“Right through the middle of this decade, BAE continues to grow. The big question is what happens after sales for Typhoon begin to slow and once major programmes like the Astute submarines in the UK have ended,” he says.
87;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2010-01-27T19:15:21Z;US industrials offer cautious outlook;;"Some of the largest US industrial companies on Wednesday sounded a cautious note in their outlook for this year, saying they were seeing signs of recovery but suggesting prospects for real growth were uncertain.Caterpillar, Boeing and General Dynamics, three of the US’s biggest manufacturers, all projected full-year earnings below Wall Street’s expectations. Illinois Tool Works also issued earnings guidance for the first quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates.The forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector, which many economists have predicted will lead a US economic recovery this year, may find the going tougher than expected.Shares in Caterpillar dropped 6.6 per cent to $52.17 by midday trading in New York on Wednesday after the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy-duty engines said it expected full-year profits this year of about $2.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.71 per share.The company said it would depend on China and other emerging economies for growth this year, saying the economies of North America, Europe and Japan “remain weak and have not rebounded as quickly as developing countries”.For the fourth quarter of 2009, Caterpillar unveiled net profit ahead of analysts’ expectations, although revenue fell short of predictions. The company’s net profit was $232m, or 36 cents per share, although excluding redundancy costs net profit was 41 cents per share. However, they exceeded average analysts’ forecasts of about 28 cents per share.As expected, the results were well down from the previous year, when Caterpillar made a net profit of $661m, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter. Revenues fell to $7.9bn, down from $12.9bn last year and below expectations of about $8.1bn.Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft-maker, said it expected revenues for 2010 of $64bn-$66bn, down from $68.3bn last year. It forecast full-year earnings per share of $3.70-$4 – below the $4.25 analysts were expecting.However, the company also said it expected revenues to rebound in 2011, boosted by its 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft is now in flight testing, albeit more than two years behind its original schedule, with first deliveries projected for the fourth quarter this year. The longer-term outlook helped propel Boeing’s shares 5.3 per cent higher by midday at $60.78.Boeing made a net profit of $1.3bn, or $1.75 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $86m, or 12 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations of about $1.36 per share.Revenue was $17.9bn, up from $12.7bn a year earlier, broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts. Fourth-quarter results in 2008 reflected the impact of a damaging two-month-long machinists’ strike and a writedown on the 747 programme.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and submarines for the US military as well as business jets, said earnings for 2010 would be $6.40-$6.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts for earnings of about $6.53. The company’s shares were 2.1 per cent lower at $67.27 by midday.Boeing, which generates half of its revenues from its defence unit, and General Dynamics both face the uncertainty of the forthcoming US defence budget and Quadrennial Defense Review, which will be released on Monday.Boeing said it expected a “reduced scope on army modernisation and missile defence programmes” this year, while Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive, said the company would look to “further reposition our defence, space and security business”.After almost a decade of strong growth, US defence companies are bracing themselves for a more challenging outlook. The budget is expected to indicate
modest increases in 2011 spending on research and kit while confirming long-term declines.The Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s long-range planning document, is likely to reaffirm the Department of Defense’s recent efforts to shift spending towards current conflicts such as Afghanistan and away from expensive platforms designed for conventional wars.Illinois Tool Works, the industrial conglomerate, also disappointed Wall Street, saying it expects first-quarter profit from continuing operations of 48-60 cents per share, below analysts’ average expectations of about 63 cents per share. Its shares were 2.5 per cent lower at $44.06 by midday in New York.United Technologies, another industrial conglomerate, reaffirmed its earnings guidance of 7-13 per cent growth this year, but cautioned revenues would pick up more slowly.The company said its Carrier unit, which sells heating and air conditioning systems and is exposed to early cycle businesses, was seeing a recovery in residential housing orders, but its aerospace businesses had yet to turn.Its shares fell 1.7 per cent to $67.33 by midday."
88;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-10-05T18:55:52Z;Financial stocks lift mood on Wall Street;;Financial stocks led US equities higher on Monday, helping investors to regain some confidence after two weeks of losses.Goldman Sachs advised buying shares in large banks, lifting JPMorgan 3.3 per cent to $43.22 and Wells Fargo 5.6 per cent to $27.76.The bank said larger institutions were set to outperform regional banks as the acquisitions they made at the height of the crisis begin to pay off.Goldman Sachs itself gained 2.9 per cent to $184.72 after it emerged that the bank stands to receive a payment of about $1bn if the commercial lender CIT files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Last week, CIT launched a debt exchange as part of a restructuring plan to avoid collapse. CIT shares were up 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Citigroup’s main investors, urged the US government to sell its stake in the bank as soon as this year in order to boost investor confidence, according to reports. Citi gained 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $16.71 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the bank had plans to select an emergency chief executive this week if legal issues force Ken Lewis to leave before the end of the year.American Express gained 2.2 per cent to $33.19 after Alfred Kelly, the credit card issuer’s president, said he would leave the company next year to seek an opportunity as a chief executive elsewhere.Renewed optimism in the sector helped lift the mood on Wall Street after discouraging economic data and falling commodity prices caused the S&P 500 to lose 1.4 per cent last week and 2.2 per cent during the previous week.By midday, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent to 1,035.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 9,559.09 and the Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 2,064.15.The Institute for Supply Management’s September reading of the services sector was also better than expected, helping stocks extend their early gains.Economists had been expecting a reading of 50, indicating growth after 11 months of contraction, but the ISM recorded a level of 50.9. Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said the market was now focused on the third-quarter earnings season, which begins this week.“We’re waiting for the big news in the form of earnings and revenue expectations for the quarters to come,” he said. “That’s going to be what drives the market.“Companies need to show positive expectations for higher revenue because cost-cutting measures can only take you so far,” Mr Colvin said.Industrial stocks rebounded on Monday after last week’s losses.General Dynamics rose 2 per cent to $64.36 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equal-weight”, saying it expected a recovery in the company’s Gulfstream jet unit from 2011.Caterpillar announced plans to raise prices on most of its machinery by up to 2 per cent next year. Its shares gained 2.7 per cent to $50.15.The pharmaceutical sector was also in focus. Seattle Genetics fell 16.9 per cent to $10.94 after the biotechnology company halted trials of its experimental drug, which had been designed to treat patients with lymphoma.Amicus Therapeutics said it would not pursue final stage trials of a drug for Gaucher disease after a study showed the treatment was ineffective. JPMorgan then downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”, increasing pressure on the shares, which plunged 32.3 per cent to $5.78.Meanwhile, Depomed climbed 24.7 per cent to $5.50 after announcing late on Friday of positive results from trials of its neuropathic pain drug.While technology stocks lagged behind most sectors, Brocade Communications Systems, which provides networking solutions, climbed 16.9 per cent to $8.94 after reports that the company had put itself up for sale.Oracle advanced 0.4 per cent to $20.43 and Hewlett-Packard was up 1 per cent to $45.72 after speculation that they could be potential buyers.
89;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;UK homeland security: Companies seek fresh sources of income;;"At a Science Museum event last month, defence industry executives mingled with senior figures from Whitehall and the intelligence community.They were there for the launch of the UK’s science and technology strategy for countering international terrorism, brainchild of Charles Farr, top security official at the Home Office.Defence contractors – eager to tap into national security as traditional areas of their business face deep cuts – have long bemoaned the fact that the counter-terror market is difficult to access.This is because of the large number of customers – ranging from local police forces to MI5 – and a lack of clarity about what products companies should be developing.But there is a shared belief that the new strategy represents a breakthrough in relations between industry and the intelligence community, although senior Whitehall officials concede it is not a panacea.“Companies such as Thales, EADS and BAE Systems are demanding clarity on what we want,” says one security official. “And what we are hoping to get from them is a bit of leverage on their R&D, which of course is enormous, and to map it on to our requirements just as the military has done.”“We now have the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism as more of the focal point as a potential customer,” the official adds.“But as far as industry is concerned, government is still difficult to understand, which is why we’ve moved much further ahead on explaining to industry: this is how we operate, these are the kinds of things in which we are interested.”The list of key challenges the strategy highlights includes: understanding the causes of radicalisation; protecting national infrastructure; reducing the vulnerability of crowded places; countering cyber-terror; improving analytical software for MI5, MI6 and GCHQ; and combating improvised explosives.The UK should also build industrial capacity in a series of technologies, the strategy recommends, including knowledge management, screening, biometrics and physical protectionIn a previously classified excerpt from a Ministry of Defence report, terrorist threats are identified in areas as diverse as biotechnology, nanotechnology and robotics.“We don’t for a moment think that BAE will invest £200m on the basis of these documents, but they will hopefully start conversations,” says the security official.There is hope this engagement will bear fruit, with industry largely welcoming the new strategy.Harvey Lewis, head of security strategy at Detica, the IT and cybersecurity specialist bought recently by BAE, says: “What is particularly striking about the document is how closely it brings together defence and security, something that mirrors what industry is trying to do.”Domestic security services are particularly eager to tap into the science used to protect vehicles against roadside bombs in Afghanistan. Developments in countering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear explosives – sometimes referred to as dirty bombs – will also have uses in domestic urban centres and foreign battlefields.Equally important for industry is the ability to sell security products to the private sector, from power companies protecting their plants to banks safeguarding customer data. Mr Lewis estimates the UK government spends about £3.5bn a year on national security, with a similar amount being spent by private companies.General Dynamics UK, local arm of the US defence manufacturer, says it is prioritising security contracts with the private sector because they tend to run at “hundreds of millions of pounds” rather than the “tens of millions” in smaller government deals.“The problem has always been the cost of the sale,” says Danny Milligan, GD’s UK head of security systems. “The budgets are so spread around between government departments, police forces and local authorities that it tends to be a very expensive sale unless you have a very simple product.”Instead, in common with many peers, General Dynamics has sought contracts with multinational companies, particularly for the protection of oil and gas infrastructure, including one to protect Royal Dutch Shell’s huge gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar.Companies are hoping similar big projects might happen in the UK, particularly if Dubai Ports revisits plans to build a huge deep-sea port in Essex.While the UK security budget has risen sharply since 2001, it could come under pressure as the Treasury seeks spending cuts. As a result, private sector sales and foreign exports will be crucial in encouraging contractors to develop anti-terror products.This helps explain why companies are eager to provide products and services for the 2012 Olympics in London.As one Whitehall official puts it: “The Olympics is a tremendous opportunity to showcase what the private sector can do in the security space. Not only do you have a UK security kitemark on the product but you’ve got an Olympic kitemark to boot.”"
90;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Force Protection: Back on the road to recovery;;The noticeboard outside Charles Mathis’s office carries a note from the Prince of Wales thanking his company, Force Protection, for saving the lives of British soldiers with its armoured vehicles.The letter is one of many from serving troops and their friends, family and commanders. They are a constant reminder to the company’s staff that the work they do means life or death to soldiers.The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have been a boon for many defence companies but few have been as closely tied to them as FP. Its massive trucks have become enduring symbols of the operations, even earning a cameo in the latest Transformers movie.Wartime spending propelled the Ladson, South Carolina-based company from nothing to $1.3bn of turnover in the space of three years. By 2008, with more than 2,000 workers and a shot at contracts worth several billion dollars, it had a chance to challenge the biggest in the sector.However, after a series of missteps, an accounting problem and the impact of the slow draw-down from Iraq, FP is now coping with falling sales, increased competition and the prospect of a far more limited future.“The company thought of itself as a serial truck manufacturer, producing thousands and thousands of vehicles,” says Mr Mathis, chief financial officer. “But we can’t compete with the Navistars of the world. Our core competency is niche survivability solutions.”A 430,000 sq ft hangar in Roxboro, North Carolina, points to a rather different scale of ambition. It is partly used for training but mostly sits empty.It was bought in 2007 as the company invested heavily in anticipation of winning a contract to provide the US military with up to 10,000 lighter, faster protected vehicles, known as M-ATVs.The order went to Oshkosh, prompting disbelief at FP, a round of redundancies and another fall in the share price.FP has always been something of an oddity in the defence market, starting out selling power boats. In 2002, it changed tack, buying a company that made armoured vehicles based on South African designs from the 1970s and used mainly for humanitarian missions such as mine clearance.The move looked no more promising than its previous efforts until the invasion of Iraq and the explosion of violence there created a sudden demand for heavily armoured vehicles able to withstand the devastating force of roadside bombs.Under pressure to find a solution or withdraw as the death toll began to accelerate, the US military eventually secured emergency funding of more than $22bn for 15,400 bomb-proof trucks known as mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs).“We had the right product, in the right place at the right time,” says Tommy Pruitt, head of communications. The US military tested a number of vehicles and steadily increased its purchases before placing an order worth $500m for 1,000 MRAPs in early 2007.The product was Cougar, a massive truck with a distinctive V-shaped hull and a high carriage to deflect explosions. The sealed cabin is also surrounded by the wheel fittings to give added protection to the crew and make it easier to repair.The result was a remarkable boom for FP, which teamed with General Dynamics to meet demand. Revenues soared from $50m in 2005 to $1.3bn in 2008 and the share price initially followed suit jumping from below $1 in 2005 to $27 in 2007, as investors eyed the potential for even bigger orders.But as such companies as BAE Systems and Navistar entered the market, the buzz quickly faded. Revenues peaked in 2008 and the shares have dropped to about $5.At the same time analysts say company controls struggled to keep up with the rapid growth. Accounts were filed late as were deliveries, leading to censures from the SEC and the Defense Department Inspector General.Like the protected vehicles that made it famous, FP took some heavy punishment but kept on rolling. Under pressure from shareholders, it found a new chief executive and appointed Mr Mathis as chief financial officer.The team has cleaned up the accounts and steered the company towards support services and exports, notably to the UK, where the company has delivered hundreds of Cougar variants and has orders for 97 more, worth $122.6m.FP now has more than 300 staff posted in places such as the Middle East refurbishing its vehicles as they are redeployed to Afghanistan. The company remains the sole provider of mine-clearance vehicles for the US army, with its scorpion-like Buffalo that has an extendible claw.Meanwhile, it has invested its cash pile in developing a new type of bolt-on armour for vehicles and a lightweight protected vehicle.Those are eminently sensible moves, according to James McIlree, an analyst with Collins Stewart, but they will only have a real impact “at some point in the future. For now, sales will decline.” Mr McIlree expects revenues of $815m in 2009 and $761m in 2010.“Losing the M-ATV contract was very disappointing,” he adds. “The contract would have set up a long-term production line. Without it, it is going to be difficult to find growth.”
91;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Industry redraws its battleplan for a new era;;Over the past year defence stocks have taken a beating. In the US, Lockheed Martin shares are down 40 per cent while Northrop Grumman has lost almost 30 per cent of its value. In Europe, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica shares have fallen by similar amounts.Valuations have been hit even harder with forward price-to-earnings multiples, a measure of investor appetite for a stock, dropping to just under nine times 2010 earnings, their lowest levels since the early 1990s.Back then the falls presaged a brutal period for the defence industry. With the cold war at an end, US spending on defence fell by more than half leading to a wave of consolidation and savage cuts in employment.Investors fear a repeat performance and some analysts say, with good reason. In the UK, where the equipment programme is already widely regarded as underfunded, spending is likely to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent according to some estimates as the Treasury seeks to address huge public deficits.The government has promised a foreign policy led defence review next year, but when it arrives drastic equipment cuts are likely to steal the limelight. Two aircraft carriers could be reduced to one while an upgrade to the Trident nuclear deterrent could be postponed.“It is clear that there is a black hole in the defence budget,” a recent report led by two prominent British politicians concluded. “[The government] should explore all viable options for capability downgrading and quantity reductions as well as for complete cancellation of some equipment programmes.”But while damaging for the UK defence capability, any cuts may in fact have only a limited impact on UK defence companies, says Sandy Morris, an aerospace and defence analyst with RBS and a long-time observer of the sector.“Industry by and large has long since decided that we have a Mickey Mouse defence policy and has fled [to the US]. Even fairly significant cuts in the UK are barely going to have a material impact on BAE Systems, Cobham and Ultra Electronics.”The picture in the US also looks challenging though. The core US defence budget will edge towards $600bn a year but the supplemental budgets, which fund current operations, will decline sharply as the US winds down in Iraq and wages a more limited campaign in Afghanistan.As a result the total US spend on research and new procurement will fall about $45bn from its 2008 peak by 2010, equivalent to more than two times the entire Navy shipbuilding budget, according to Marty Bollinger, head of the defence practice at Booz & Company. He believes total investment spending could drop by 40 per cent in real terms over the next three years. That could lead to a radical shake-up of the sector.In the 1990s, the industry reduced capacity through a wave of mergers, but with so few players left that is no longer an option. Instead, traditional contractors will lose market share to “disruptive companies” that offer good-enough but not “exquisite” products.Mr Bollinger expects companies such as Eurocopter, the helicopter group owned by EADS, to do well by taking advantage of its global scale and ability to adapt commercial products to military uses at good prices.Defence companies are also likely to focus on providing support services, such as repairs and training, for the military as US spending on operations and maintenance overtakes the investment budget for the first time.Not everyone expects such a dramatic change. Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities, sees the recent share price movements as yet another example of investors looking to profit from an upturn in the economy by buying cyclical stocks.Underlying trading, he argues, has remained strong. In the first half most defence companies produced solid results, generating cash and building order books. A constant refrain was that programme cuts in some areas had resulted in gains in other areas.At BAE Systems, for example, Ian King, chief executive, noted that a slowdown in demand for its heavily armoured vehicles would probably be offset by a pick-up in combat aircraft sales as production of the F-35, America’s newest combat jet, ramps up.Certain areas of the budget will grow even as total spending declines.The quadrennial review, due shortly, will probably confirm the US administration’s intention to shift funds from expensive platforms such as the F-22 stealth fighter jet to support “irregular” warfare and current operations.In preparation for the emerging trends, global defence companies have been scooping up midsized suppliers with products aimed at defence electronics, unmanned aerial vehicles and cybersecurity.In one of the larger deals this year, General Dynamics, best known for its armoured vehicles, bought Axsys Technologies, a maker of sensors and cameras for the military, for $643m.Foreign sales are another potential bright spot. According to Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy, in the next 10 years India will spend $100bn on equipment while Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are increasing their spending on defence.For all the talk of budget cuts, Alberto De Benedictis, chief executive of Finmeccanica UK, argues that countervailing pressures will make it hard for governments to reduce defence spending, regardless of their financial position.“In the 1990s there was a clear change in the global strategic scenario, but this time round there is no such change. The threats remain the same. What we do have is a period of budget constraint.”Afghanistan for example, could flare up at any time, requiring greater expenditures. In recent days Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted the situation was “serious and it is deteriorating” adding to the clamour for more troops.Still, Mr Bollinger worries that the fat years and the inevitable time lag between cuts at the policy level and the impact on the industrial base have made executives slow to recognise the scale of the challenges ahead.“The scale of the downturn is going to be of the same magnitude as in the 1990s, so why would you expect to see a different outcome?” he asks.
92;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;BAE Systems: Ministry contract is must-win for unloved giant;;At the BAE Systems plant in Ornsköldsvik, Sweden, the workers tap away at green turtle-like cases of metal. They will eventually become ferocious CV90 armoured vehicles, capable of firing 200 rounds a minute, travelling at 70km per hour and carrying a squad of troops.The factory is quiet and production of the CV90s at a trickle. This month only four units will roll off the line, as the company tries to eke out the last 50 vehicles of the order until the next one comes along.Dan Lindell, product manager for the CV90, is optimistic however.In Canada, the government intends to spend up to C$5bn ($4.6bn) on a family of combat vehicles while in the UK BAE is proposing the CV90 to supply the army with up to 1,300 specialist vehicles as part of the revamped Future Rapid Effects System (FRES) contract.A new order could not come too soon for BAE’s Global Combat Systems (GCS) unit, which makes armoured vehicles and ammunition in the UK and Sweden and contributes about $2bn or 5 per cent of revenues to BAE.It has struggled of late. After missing out on an earlier version of the FRES programme last year, the company cut about 700 UK jobs, prompting fears that Britain could lose the ability to make tanks.In Sweden, where the CV90 is built at the old Hägglunds plant in Ornsköldsvik, BAE is fast running down an £800m order book and cannot sell its next generation product – a modular troop carrier.Despite investing heavily in the project, in February the Swedish government selected a Finnish rival for a key contract, creating the perception of serious problems. “They have killed it as an export product,” says Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, a vice-president with BAE.Lack of government support has been a key problem, says Francis Tusa, editor of the newsletter Defence Analysis. Since the end of the cold war, UK government spending on armoured vehicles has withered and, with it, once famous names such as Alvis and Vickers – rolled into BAE in 2004.BAE has not helped itself with late and overbudget projects, says Mr Tusa. “But they have also been a victim of Anyone But BAE syndrome”, where the UK Ministry of Defence is unwilling to commit even more of its portfolio to one company. While the MoD has spent some £700m on protected patrol vehicles in recent years, BAE has largely missed out.A new strategy for the procurement of armoured vehicles unveiled by the UK MoD in June, suggested that from now on Britain would be content to buy foreign-made vehicles as long as the UK retained the ability to modify and repair them.By contrast, other European countries have protected their tank and truck makers, and they are in better health as a result, says Chris Foss, land forces editor at Jane’s. In Germany, Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, are feasting on orders worth €3.1bn to deliver 405 Puma vehicles.In response to the reduced workload, BAE has aggressively reorganised. It created GCS this year and announced plant closures and job losses. More could follow.The unit is also adapting, focusing on support services, integration and upgrade work. It recently won a £28m contract to support command vehicles, and is bidding for more work. One crucial project is the contract to upgrade Warrior fighting vehicles.But Peter Nygren, head of Readiness and Sustainment for BAE in Sweden, admits techniques learned supporting combat jets will be hard to translate to the land arena.That makes winning FRES crucial, says Mr Tusa. The first tranche, for 600 tracked vehicles to replace Britain’s aging reconnaissance fleet, could be worth up £2bn.The programme has committed funding and the MoD is pressing for an accelerated schedule. But budget pressures may yet derail the project and BAE will have to fend off competition from the UK arm of US vehicles giant General Dynamics.“If it loses, the Hägglunds is gone for a ball of chalk and many UK sites will close due to lack of work,” Mr Tusa says.
93;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-07-23T14:52:35Z;Armoured vehicle purchases to go ahead;;Despite the budget crisis, the government is quietly moving ahead with a £16bn programme to acquire thousands of multi-purpose armoured vehicles for the military, described by a group of MPs as a “fiasco” earlier in the year.In the next few days the Ministry of Defence is likely to send out a final invitation to contractors BAE Systems and General Dynamics (UK) to bid for a chunk of the Future Rapid Effects System project worth up to £2bn.The tender is for 600 tracked vehicles to replace Britain’s aging fleet of Scimitars and Spartans which have been used for vital reconnaissance and troop carrying missions in Afghanistan but suffer from excess weight and an inability to fire on the move.The programme has committed funding and the MoD is pressing for an accelerated schedule. It has asked for responses from the two companies by September and a decision would follow in March of next year with deliveries starting in 2014.Earlier in the month, Quentin Davies, procurement minister, said the vehicles would “play a major role in current operations and in equipping the army to stand ready to respond to a wide range of contingencies in the future”.But privately, industry executives are worried that severe MoD budget pressures are inducing paralysis in some parts of the equipment budget, and that the looming election will lead the government to delay at the last minute.In total the MoD plans to buy about 1,200 so-called specialist vehicles comprising three families, including reconnaissance, medium armour and manoeuvre support, making it one of the largest programmes of its type in the world.The purchase is just one part of the hugely ambitious Fres programme to buy a new generation of armoured vehicles. In total, it envisages a fleet of 3,000 units using common basic components to cut down on maintenance costs.But the programme has been beset by horrendously complex contracting processes, false starts and delays. Earlier this year the Commons defence committee attacked the MoD, saying it had “wasted both its and industry’s time and money”.Last year, the MoD selected the UK arm of GD, the US contractor, as the provisional preferred bidder for a wheeled “utility vehicle” that was to be the backbone of the army’s fleet, only to drop the contest due to a dispute about intellectual property rights with the company.Since then the MoD has attempted to clarify its approach to buying armoured fighting vehicles. Last month, it issued a new strategy paper and it has streamlined the procurement process for Fres Specialist Vehicle. Industry insiders remain hopeful but unconvinced.For the UK industrial base the implications could be substantial. In April, BAE Systems cut about 500 jobs, blaming the decision to postpone the earlier rounds of Fres. It has hinted at more cuts to come if it loses out.

Leaders in business and politics argue that their nation of 3m people should be home to international businesses that need a skilled, committed and – relatively – low-cost workforce.The fastest trains will take you from London to the Welsh capital of Cardiff in just over two hours, but this city is itself a regional financial hub. Zurich, Legal & General, ING Direct and home-grown success story, Admiral Insurance, are all located within walking distance of each other. A wide range of commercial legal firms also compete for clients.Businesses that locate in Wales reap the benefits of European Union membership – which includes opportunities for financial aid in the poorest areas of the nation. Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the three cities along the south Wales coast, are all on the M4 motorway. There are also good air and sea links with the Republic of Ireland.Wales’s eight universities are encouraged to collaborate with industry to add value to products and enterprises at every opportunity. There are about 250 companies in the bioscience sector, and Swansea University has become a dynamo for the industry through its teaming-up with IBM to found the Institute for Life Sciences.Cardiff is home to BBC Wales, Welsh-language broadcaster S4C and numerous independent companies. Welsh universities are brimming with students hoping to join the 6,750 people in the city already employed in the creative sector.South Wales has been a destination for leading aerospace companies such as General Dynamics, British Airways and EADS defence and security systems.Swansea University offers niche skills in this sector through the Material Research Centre and the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre, and the Airbus facility in Broughton, north Wales, is a centre of wing production. There are 37,700 in Swansea educated to degree level or equivalent and 73,400 in Cardiff.A network of “techniums” has been established to give businesses locating in the nation a “soft landing”. These centres provide basic facilities and each has a different emphasis, ranging from performance engineering to sustainable technology.A significant attraction of Wales remains the low cost by UK standards of the labour force. Gross weekly earnings average just £498.Pay ranges from £457.80 ($744.93) a week in the mainly rural areas of Powys and Monmouthshire to £551 in Cardiff, Newport and the Vale of Glamorgan – far below the London average of £765.Across Wales, nearly a third of people are employed in public administration, education and health. Banking, finance and insurance employs 14.2 per cent – significantly below the UK average of 21.2 per cent. A further 13.4 per cent work in manufacturing, compared with 10.9 per cent across the UK, and 5.3 per cent are in construction.For many investors, an incentive to come to Wales remains the good chance of securing grant aid. The process of gaining access to assistance has been simplified through the creation of the Single Investment Fund.Grants of between 10 and 30 per cent of project costs can be won – with the possibility of even greater funding for smaller businesses investing in the areas of most need.Office costs in Cardiff are in line with those in Liverpool and Nottingham at £215 per sq m. This is below nearby Bristol and the Scottish city of Glasgow where accommodation costs an average of £296 per sq m. Industrial rents vary from £35 per sq m in Bangor to £40 in Swansea and £55 in Cardiff.……………………………………………………..And why you might want to relocate your family there, too …Live in Wales and you are never more than a short journey away from some of the most spectacular scenery in the United Kingdom. Swansea is within easy reach of the Gower peninsula and its magnificent coastline.This was the first area of Britain officially designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”.Cardiff is also flanked by coastline and walkers enjoy the quiet grandeur of the Brecon Beacons. Swansea is a one-hour train ride away. There are 321,000 people living in Cardiff and 170,000 in Swansea.Wales has a gregarious business culture, and arrivals will find an enthusiastic welcome in either of the cities’ business clubs and local chambers of commerce.Each city has a wide choice of housing, ranging from Victorian dwellings to waterfront apartments.House prices have risen dramatically in the past decade but still lag far behind the London average of £302,411. According to the Land Registry house price index, properties in Cardiff cost an average of £138,647 in April, compared with £112,890 in Swansea.The SA1 waterfront development in Swansea is just a 10-minute walk from the city centre. A new two-bedroom apartment overlooking the marina will cost about £260,000.A five-bedroom period terrace house in Cardiff Bay near the National Assembly buildings can be found for £495,000. A highlight of living in such a sought-after location is the presence of the Wales Millennium Centre, a world-class theatre that is the base of the Welsh National Opera.You can find excellent state schools in and around each city. Cardiff High School’s exam results have been praised as “outstanding” by inspection agency Estyn; 80 per cent of pupils achieved five GCSEs at grades A*-C. Bishopston Comprehensive School, located on the Gower peninsula is also regarded as a top performer, with 85 per cent of GCSE results in the A*-C range. Swansea’s Olchfa School regularly sends up to 10 pupils a year to Oxford or Cambridge.Wales has less of a tradition of private education than England, but a notable school is St John’s College in Cardiff. Here, 90.5 per cent of A-Level results were grades A and B. Monthly fees for the sixth form are £1,050. At the city’s Cathedral School, where children aged three to 16 study, 68 per cent of all GCSE grades were at A* or A."
95;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-06-22T22:31:29Z;Chief of BAE’s US arm leaves for SAIC;;The head of BAE Systems’ US business, its largest by revenues, has resigned.Walter Havenstein, president and chief executive of BAE Systems Inc, who was also a member of the company’s board, is set to become the chief executive at Science Applications International Corporation.SAIC is a Fortune 500 science and engineering company that has a key presence in the national security sector. SAIC was unavailable for comment.Nick Cunningham, an Evolution Securities analyst, said: “Is it a blow to BAE? To some degree it’s disruptive, but there are some good people in the US so they shouldn’t have a problem replacing him.”The move comes as BAE’s North American business enters more testing waters and just weeks before the US Department of Defence is due to make a key decision on whether to purchase a new set of land vehicles from the company.Sales of land systems in the US have expanded dramatically in recent years thanks to a series of acquisitions and the war in Iraq, which created a need for armoured vehicles able to withstand mines and roadside bombs.But that growth is set to drop off as the US military winds down purchases of its mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, leaving what Mr Cunningham estimates will be a $1.3bn revenue gap.To fill that space the company is currently competing to sell a fleet of mine resistant all terrain vehicles to the US military that are suitable for use in the rugged terrain of Afghanistan.The order, for as many as 10,000, could be worth as much as $2bn-$4bn a year to BAE over the next three years depending on how the contract is split.BAE is competing against companies such as Navistar, Oshkosh and a Force Protection and General Dynamics team.Mr Havenstein took over as chief executive of BAE Systems Inc in January 2007. Prior to that he was president of the company’s Electronics and Intelligence and Support business.He relinquishes control on June 26 and until a permanent successor can be found, he will be replaced by General Anthony Zinni.General Zinni, already a member of BAE’s US board, spent 39 years in the military including a stint as Commander-in-Chief, US Central Command.Shares in BAE Systems fell 2½p to 340½p.
96;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-06-14T23:47:15Z;Profile: Elbit Systems;;In their three-week offensive against Hamas at the start of the year, Israeli forces confronted tough challenges. On average it took Palestinian rocket teams about 90 seconds to emerge from hideouts in the densely populated Gaza Strip and launch their weapons.With so little time to identify suspicious targets and either attack or dismiss them, the IDF relied heavily on its arsenal of hi-tech weaponry. A complex network of unmanned aerial vehicles, high-powered computers and precision munitions gave Israel an edge.At the core of that capability is Elbit Systems, until recently a little-known Israeli defence electronics company. But its role in Gaza has coincided with and contributed to the company’s growing prominence. After more than a decade of breakneck growth, Elbit is now one of the 40 largest defence companies in the world.Elbit’s rise has been a rapid one. When it was floated on the Tel Aviv and Nasdaq stock exchanges in 1996 it had revenues of just under $200m concentrated on the Israeli Ministry of Defence. In 2008, revenues were approaching $3bn – more than 80 per cent of which were generated outside Israel.Acquisitions have fuelled much of that growth. Over the past 13 years the company has slowly rolled up all but a handful of Israel’s private defence contractors. Prominent milestones include the purchase of Elop in 2000, which brought Elbit a big new shareholder, Federmann Enterprises, a family-owned investment vehicle, and a new chairman in Michael Federmann.Elbit has paired expansion at home with a deliberate effort to access foreign markets. In 1992 the company made its first purchase in America and subsequently set up Elbit Systems of America, based in Fort Worth, Texas, to pitch to the Department of Defence. It now boasts a “multi-domestic” approach that uses local business and knowledge to tap local markets.Roni Biron, an analyst with UBS, says the strategy has largely been successful. “Acquisitions, and the range of solutions that Elbit can now provide, mean that the company is more and more visible to clients. That is why their growth is accelerating and their order backlog is so high compared to revenues.”The company has developed a knack for picking important niches ahead of its competitors. Elbit, along with its Israeli peers, was quick to grasp the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles and it retains a lead in the area. In 2005 its Hermes, all-weather, long-endurance UAV was selected as the basis for the UK government’s ambitious £900m ($1.5bn) Watchkeeper programme.Its broader foray into the area of digital systems to capture and process information on battlefield was equally prescient. Net-centric warfare, as it is known, has become a buzz-concept since the Pentagon cottoned on to the idea in the 1990s. But Elbit is one of the companies making it a reality.In particular, the Gaza engagement was an early test for Elbit’s $1bn Digital Army Program for Israel’s ministry of defence. As the prime contractor, Elbit is computerising the IDF, from the individual soldier on the ground to the headquarters behind the lines, in order to give commanders a better grasp of the battlefield.“We spend twice as much as the average defence company on research and development, about 8 per cent of revenues,” said Joseph Ackerman, Elbit’s chief executive. “And that allows us to analyse trends and develop technology before others get there.”A close relationship with the IDF is another plus. “Most of our employees are engineers and officers and they are still doing reserve duty in the army,” Mr Ackerman said. “So one day they are designing equipment and the next day they are using it. That means we see both sides of the coin.”Still, Elbit has had its setbacks. In 2005 the company purchased a 70 per cent stake in Elisra, bringing it a useful electronic warfare capability but also a long-running dispute with Israel’s powerful unions over job security. Mr Ackerman says relations are now much improved.And for all its talk of local knowledge, some segments have been harder to crack than expected. Elbit still has not sold a single UAV to the Department of Defence in the US, and has al but admitted that it cannot go it alone. In May the company signed a joint venture with General Dynamics to markets its Hermes and Skylark systems.But Mr Ackerman hopes that the company’s focus on the electronics niche will help it stay ahead, even as defence budgets around the world come under pressure. After its first quarter results in early May he predicted that Elbit would continue to produce double-digit revenue growth thanks to its record backlog of orders worth $5.1bn.And he is prepared to put money on that prospect. Elbit could spend up to $500m on the right purchase he said. Israel looks a likely target. With the election of the business-friendly Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, privatisation is back on the agenda. Top of the list of candidates would be the three government-owned defence companies.“Everyone has talked about the privatisation [of Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems] for years,” says Mr Ackerman. “But if it happens, Elbit will certainly play a role.”
97;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-06-02T16:28:15Z;BAE highlights resurgent bond demand;;BAE Systems has raised $1.5bn (£907m) in bonds, underscoring that solid industrial companies are now able to take advantage of the reopening of credit markets under way since the start of the year.“BAE is exactly the type of industrial company with a BBB rating that six months ago would have struggled to raise cash,” said Garry Jenkins, a credit strategist at Evolution. He added that “now it fits the bill: it is well known, with a solid business that is well understood by the market and the kind of rating that will give investors the yield they want in a market that has gone from financial Armageddon to euphoria.”Corporate bond issuance has been dramatic this year as companies raise cash and investors shun equities. Non-financial investment-grade companies around the world have raised $725bn compared with $410bn in 2008 and $280bn in 2007. In the UK, corporations have raised $39bn, roughly $10bn more than in 2008.Within that broad swell, aerospace and defence companies, along with utilities and telecommunications groups, have been particularly attractive to investors because of their large order backlogs, reasonable cash flows and healthy liquidity.In April, Rolls-Royce, the aerospace engine maker, sold £500m in bonds, its first venture into the market for 10 years. General Dynamics, United Technologies and Thales have also raised money this year.Meanwhile, experts suggest that Finmeccanica, the Italian defence conglomerate, is likely to go to market again soon to refinance the debts it built up to purchase DRS Technologies, an American defence electronics company, in 2008.For BAE, the refinancing pushes out maturity dates, puts investors’ minds at ease and adds flexibility, said Tom Chruszcz, an analyst with Fitch Ratings.“BAE now has little debt maturing over the next five years, which means they can use their cash as they see fit,” said Mr Chruszcz. At the end of 2008, BAE’s had net cash of £39m.The private placement to institutional investors was split into $500m and $1bn tranches and was sold to replace two similar chunks of debt due in 2010 and 2011 respectively. According to UBS the new debt will cost BAE just $750,000 a year in extra interest costs.However, experts are not convinced that the such opportunities will be available for long. “We had a feeling that the window could close last month,” Mr Chruszcz said. “It is remarkable how long it has stayed open. But uncertainty about how long the recession will last means that it will close and that is why companies are rushing to market now.”
98;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2009-05-29T22:36:57Z;World of opportunity spied in cyber securities;;Cyber security is often talked about in terms of threats. But for UK defence companies, the area seems a world of opportunities.With the release of the White House report on the subject yesterday, clarifying the administration’s priorities and crucial lines of command, those opportunities are one step closer.“[Political momentum in the US] has brought new programmes and new budgets,” says Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems. Security revenues are already worth about £1bn a year to the company, he said, most of which come from the US and UK.Cyber security covers everything from guarding military information systems from attack by foreign governments, to protecting intellectual property.The prize for companies that can meet those needs is significant. As defence budgets flatten out or even decline, the security segment offers a high growth niche. Analysts at Merrill Lynch expect the US to spend $14.6bn (£9.2bn) on cyber security this year and $25.5bn next year.To capitalise on the sector UK defence companies have begun to re-position themselves. BAE for example, includes developing its security business as among four global priorities and now says it aspires to be a “premier defence, security and aerospace company”.It has backed up that ambition with cash. In 2008, BAE bought Detica, a specialist provider of security technology, for £543m giving it a lead in the UK market. BAE is in the process of rolling out Detica’s capabilities in the US and elsewhere.The issue of cyber security has risen up the agenda in recent years after high profile incidents revealed the extent to which reliance on IT has made countries such as the US vulnerable to cyber attack.The US department of defence said it detected 360m efforts to break into its networks in the past year.As companies jostle for exposure to customers and niche technology, the M&A market has heated up.According to data providers Dealogic, in 2005 defence companies bought about 29 IT software and services companies in deals worth $3.1bn. In 2008 they bought 32 companies for $7.2bn.In the UK, Cobham, the aerospace and defence group, has conducted forays in the area. In 2008 it bought Sparta for $416m, which gave it a US presence in information management for the intelligence services.But the company is also doing more to pack security measures and functions into its other products, be they communications or battlefield systems, says Jeremy Wensinger, president of Cobham’s defence systems unit.“Whether it is ones and zeros to protect platforms on the battlefield or ones and zeroes to protect the electricity grid, cyber security is a requirement,” he says.But taking on US incumbents will be challenging. Lockheed Martin has a solid lead in the sector as a major provider of IT to the federal government. Its offerings run from high-end systems for US intelligence agencies, to software for the payment of social security benefits.Boeing and Northrop Grumman have both said that they will look at acquisitions in the space while Raytheon and General Dynamics have recently set up cyber-focused units.Defence companies will also butt up against commercial suppliers, as they tackle security issues for civilian federal agencies. And experts worry their military experience may not read across to commercial situations as well as expected.

Coventry Health also lost out, tumbling 14.4 per cent to $11.88.“Traders realise that the changes may begin to squeeze healthcare companies either through lowered premiums or decreased subsidies from the government,” wrote Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The Obama administration’s plans also spelt bad news for the defence sector, as it vowed to end overspending and schedule delays in the US weapons program.Shares in Boeing fell 3.5 per cent to $32.71 while Northrop lost 2.9 per cent to $39.42 and General Dynamics was off 1.9 per cent to $45.68.The major falls from these sectors cancelled out the gains made by banks, which rallied as the administration also announced plans to set aside an additional $250bn for future bail-out funds.Bank of America was a winner, up 3.1 per cent to $5.32 and was helped by news that it was looking to sell First Republic Bank, a private bank inherited from Merrill Lynch.The rally included JPMorgan, which climbed 6.1 per cent to $23.05 on the day of its investor conference. The bank expected to open 120 new retail branches and projected a total of 12,000 job cuts resulting from the merger with Washington Mutual.Wells Fargo was another strong performer, rising 7.1 per cent to $14.40. Among several regional banks to enjoy strong gains, Fifth Third also did well, up 18 per cent at $2.29.The S&P financial index reflected the advances made by banks and was the strongest performing sector, up 2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 752.83 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2 per cent at 7,182.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.4 per cent at 1,391.47 points.“There is a strong belief among the financial community that the centre of power has moved from New York to Washington,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equities strategist at Citigroup. “That is why the market moves on what the president says.”Stocks had rallied earlier in the day in spite of worse-than-expected economic data that showed continuing unemployment benefits passed the landmark 5m mark to a hit a fresh record..“The data is only going to get worse, and the figures on job losses are going to be very severe later this week,” said Mr Levkovich.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets wrote that the data would “do nothing to support serious follow through in better risk appetite today, even though the focus for the moment is very much on banks”.Consumer staples also performed badly, dragged down by Safeway, the grocery chain. Safeway shed 13 per cent to $18.37 after sales came in $400m less than analyst estimates. The sector as a whole fell 2.3 per cent.Several department stores rallied initially after Sears reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would be closing an additional 24 stores to cut costs.But the stocks fell again towards the close. Sears eased 0.8 per cent to $35.54. Kohl’s lost 1.6 per cent to $34.70 and JC Penney dropped 1.7 per cent to $15.43.Energy stocks fared well early in the day as crude oil continued to rise, hitting $45 at one point during early trade. The sector climbed in early trade but succumbed late in the day to finish just below the previous session’s level.Elsewhere, IBM bucked the general downward trend in the technology sector when it reaffirmed its full-year proft outlook and forecast a profit in its business services division.This came just a week after peer Hewlett-Packard cut its full-year outlook. IBM’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $88.97 in afternoon trade, while HP also saw some benefit, rising 0.4 per cent to $30.24.
100;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Tanks for the memories amid MoD delays;;More than 90 years after unveiling the world’s first tank in 1916, Britain could be about to lose the capability to manufacture them.A decision by the Ministry of Defence this month to revamp and delay elements of the Army’s biggest equipment procurement programme, to build a new generation of armoured vehicles, has raised questions over the long-term future of Britain’s indigenous manufacturing capability. The £16bn ($23bn) programme, the Future Rapid Effects System, was described recently as “the most disastrously managed” project in the history of defence by the chairman of the parliamentary defence committee.BAE Systems, the country’s only tank manufacturer, has warned it will have to consider “the size and shape” of its business in light of the decision. Over the years the company has swallowed up the entire domestic industry, including Alvis, Vickers, Marconi and Royal Ordnance and this industrial legacy means it maintains nearly all the armoured vehicles in the army’s current fleet. It urgently needs new orders for manufacturing work to keep its factories busy and sustain key engineering skills as older vehicles are retired.Others in the UK, including General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin of the US, and the state-owned Defence Support Group, are also waiting to see whether further investment will pay off.“We need transparency and visibility as a minimum,” says one industry executive. “The MoD needs to have a holistic view of what sort of capabilities it wants to retain in the UK. It needs the capability through-life to repair and upgrade.”Jobs and factory sites could be affected. BAE’s weapons and vehicles business, part of its Land Systems division, employs about 2,000 people globally but most are based in the UK. Its main sites here are Newcastle, Barrow, Leicester, Telford and Wolverhampton. The company announced in November it was laying off 200 people because of a work shortage.BAE declined to comment but at the time of the Fres announcement it said: “We will clearly have to consider what this means for the size and shape of the Land Systems business in the near term …The key will be to achieve an agreed understanding with MoD about a coherent strategy for the sector.”The news was also a blow for General Dynamics. As part of the MoD’s announcement it was changing its priorities on Fres it also said it would abandon long-running talks with the company over the supply of its design for the utility vehicle. The company has had to let go all its contractors that had worked on Fres but it has already spent millions of pounds on the programme. “It will be difficult to keep armoured vehicle manufacturing and integrating capability in the UK because there isn’t anything for them to do,” says Nick Cunningham, analyst at Evolution Securities.He notes that while for BAE the news on Fres might have been a blow, investors should recognise the UK business is “a bit of a side-show” in the context of its overall land systems business, which has been buoyed by large US orders for mine-resistant vehicles. He forecasts Alvis and Royal Ordnance will together generate revenues of £670m in 2008, about 10 per cent of his estimate of revenues of £6.7bn for the group’s land systems division as a whole. In terms of profits, this share is even smaller: he estimates the two will generate profits of £30m out of total land systems profits of £567m.Defence sources stress that contractors are for now being kept busy, as there is some work coming out of the MoD. Lockheed Martin, for example, is already competing with BAE on a programme to update the Warrior tank and was awarded a contract in October to undertake a turret study contract for the scout reconnaissance vehicle version of Fres.In addition, BAE, along with GD, Thales UK and others, are already undertaking assessment phase work on the Fres scout reconnaissance vehicle. Both BAE and GD have potential contenders for the scout vehicle.For the MoD, however, the key issue will be to decide just what sort of capabilities it wants to retain in the UK. The department says it will publish its new strategy on armoured fighting vehicles in the new year. Quentin Davies, the procurement minister, recently suggested the government was more focused on Britain retaining the ability to design, maintain and upgrade the platforms, rather than being focused on where armoured vehicles for future requirements were built.“The government needs to decide whether it is an important indigenous capability for the UK,” says Mr Cunningham. “The impact on BAE as a company is material but small. The impact on employment and politically would probably be disproportionately large, which might give the UK government second thoughts about allowing this capability just to fold.”
101;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-12-14T22:41:32Z;European company bond sales outdo US;;Sales of European company bonds have surged in November and December, according to industry data, recovering from a disastrous autumn to surpass US end-of-year issuance for the first time.European non-financial companies have sold almost $57.5bn of bonds in the last two months of the year, according to Dealogic, outstripping most previous totals for this time of year and ahead of the $41.4bn in the US. Asian issuance has also been healthy at $23.7bn.Bond markets had suffered a dismal September and October, after the failure of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, with Europe seeing no corporate bond sold for four weeks.The US and Europe did not see activity begin to pick up until mid-November, though the US was then slowed down by the Thanksgiving holiday.This left a tight window for companies to raise funding before the Christmas break.“It’s a record December month for non-financial corporate issuance and follows an equally very high level of issuance in November,” said Suki Mann, credit strategist at SG CIB. “Those who have got their funding away will look back with relief because conditions are not going to get any better into the first and second quarters of next year.”Liquidity in secondary markets remains extremely limited with yields stuck at highly elevated levels. But bankers say appetite for new deals has picked up and that corporate credit looks more attractive than equity markets.European issuance has been dominated by utilities such as EDF, National Grid and Vattenfal. The US has seen a wider array of names with more diverse credit ratings, including Altria, General Dynamics and Verizon, which, alongside its dollar issue, sold bonds for the first time in euros and sterling. The US even saw a junk-bond issue from El Paso, the gas pipeline company.However, issuers had to pay to get their deals away, with US AA-rated yields averaging 290 basis points above interbank lending rates, according to S&P LCD.“Spreads in investment grade are very attractive,” said Andrew Jones, managing director in UK Syndication at Barclays Capital, who is more optimistic about the new year.One factor driving optimism is that, in the financial sector, there has been a rush of European bank debt issuance without the use of government guarantees.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock
102;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-12-12T01:33:26Z;MoD faces difficult choices on spending;;"The Ministry of Defence cannot escape tough decisions over some of its big equipment programmes in the coming months despite Thursday’s announcement that it was delaying the Royal Navy’s most prestigious project, the construction of two new aircraft carriers.The department, which has been struggling with an estimated budget deficit of £2bn ($3bn, €2.2bn), bought itself some breathing space. However the delays, following an examination of its equipment programme, will not balance its books. Despite a 1.5 per cent real-terms increase in its budget for the current spending round, the department’s coffers are too depleted to sustain all the big programmes on order.“It is a sticking plaster on a deep, deep wound,” said James Arbuthnot, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons’ defence committee. “The purpose of this review was to put off decisions for two years. The general word that has been going round is that before an election there should be no bad news and no new money.”Although the Treasury has agreed the MoD can have a further £635m in 2009/10 to provide urgent support for frontline operations, John Hutton, defence minister, conceded the moves announced on Thursday would only bring “the defence equipment programme more closely into balance”. Decisions about other aspects of the programme would be “taken forward through our regular planning round, which will conclude next March”.Among these are expected to be whether the UK buys more Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and Astute submarines and remains committed to the Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft programme.The £4bn cost of the two carriers, the biggest warships ever to be built for the navy, has caused a significant problem for the MoD. Industry executives had always viewed the in-service dates for the two ships – 2014 and 2016 – as unrealistic, but until Thursday the government had repeatedly stressed it would stick to that timeline.But Mr Hutton on Thursday confirmed they would be delayed by up to two years. The new dates would bring them more closely into line with the expected in-service date of 2017 for the F-35 Lightning II, the aircraft being built to fly off them.Mr Hutton insisted there were “no industrial implications at all” to the decision.Companies involved in the project, including BAE Systems, VT Group and Babcock International, also said the decision would merely delay the creation of additional jobs at their yards.There was a mixed reaction from smaller suppliers. At Darchem Engineering, near Stockton-on-Tees, a big thermal engineer that has begun design work on its £8m contract for the carriers’ air systems, John Padbury, the marketing and sales director, said that at a time of financial crisis the government should be bringing forward programmes, not delaying them.That view was echoed by the Defence Industries Council, which said it was “particularly disappointing that the government had failed to use defence as a means of stimulating the economy”.But delaying the carriers allowed Mr Hutton to go ahead with a £1bn programme for Future Lynx helicopters to be built by AgustaWestland. Mr Hutton also announced a £70m upgrade programme for 12 existing Lynx Mark 9 helicopters.He announced significant changes to the army’s most important project, a £16bn programme for a new generation of armoured vehicles. He said the MoD would give the go-ahead for the FRES Scout vehicle, a replacement for the Scimitar and Spartan reconnaissance vehicles, but would delay a competition for the FRES utility vehicle. The decision is a blow for General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, whose design had been chosen as the preferred one. Mr Hutton said talks with GD had failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion and its offer was now going to be withdrawn.GD, which has already let go of contractors working on the project, on Thursday said it was important the MoD outlined its next steps “in a timely manner”.BAE, Britain’s biggest land systems supplier, said the move posed questions about the future size of its armoured vehicle business.Mr Hutton also confirmed the appointment of Bernard Gray, a former special adviser to Lord Robertson, defence minister in the late 1990s, to lead a review of the processes the MoD uses to buy equipment.………..Big equipment projects still in department’s pipelineThe main international defence projects that are still outstanding:Eurofighter
One of the most pressing items remaining in John Hutton’s in-tray is how to resolve Britain’s commitment to the third production run of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft under its membership of the four-nation consortium.Britain is committed to taking a further 88 aircraft but, given budgetary pressures, it has for months tried to convince its partner nations to be allowed to reduce that number.So far, the partners are deadlocked. Solving the impasse would help Mr Hutton balance the Ministry of Defence’s budget for 2009. Industry is also waiting for a decision to develop the aircraft for a variety of roles.F-35 Lightning II or Joint Strike Fighter
The decision to delay the in-service dates of the Royal Navy’s two carriers will synchronise them with the aircraft that are meant to fly off them, the F-35 Lightning II, but questions still remain over how many jets the UK will order.The UK has so far put $2bn (£1.3bn) towards the programme but has yet to sign a contract committing itself to an official number of aircraft – an initial request for 150 aircraft has already come down to 138.An important date is next January when the MoD has to decide whether to buy two test aircraft – if it does, it will be seen as a sign of its commitment but numbers are likely to be cut drastically.A400M military transport aircraft
The grand plan to build a European military transport aircraft has faced mounting challenges this year amid increased delays. EADS, the European defence and aerospace group and lead contractor, warned in November it was still unable to produce a reliable delivery schedule – the programme has run into problems with the propulsion system being built by a consortium led by the UK’s Rolls-Royce and Snecma, part of France’s Safran.Although the UK, along with its European partners, has signed a contract for the aircraft, the delays mean it has started to look at ways of mitigating any capability gaps. It is considering extending the out-of-service dates of the C130K Hercules, which the A400m is due to replace, buying additional C-17s or bringing forward the introduction of a fleet of Airbus tanker-transport aircraft. The MoD, which has 25 aircraft on order, could cut the number but it would probably face penalties if it did so."
103;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-12-04T23:32:41Z;Navy faces aircraft carriers delay;;The Royal Navy will have to wait up to two years longer for its £4bn aircraft carriers under cost-cutting plans being finalised by John Hutton, defence secretary.The decision to push back one of the government’s sacrosanct defence equipment programmes represents a sharp reversal. Ministers have always insisted the two ships would be in service by 2014 and 2016.According to industry insiders, the Ministry of Defence is considering two options: delaying the in-service date of the first carrier by 12 months or delaying the second ship by up to two years.Mr Hutton’s willingness to delay such an important programme underlines the severity of the cash crisis facing the MoD. He has expressed determination to make the department “live within its means” while prioritising support for frontline troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.He is expected to stress that investment will not stop and there will be no impact on jobs. The delay, intended to spread costs, will also help synchronise the project with the expected delivery in 2017 of the F-35 Lightning II or Joint Strike Fighter, the aircraft being built to fly from the ships.Industry executives think the earlier in-service dates unrealistic given the contract for the programme was signed this year.The results of a review of the equipment programme are expected early next week. No major programmes will be cancelled but most will face some delay. The moves will not be enough to allow the MoD to balance its budget for 2009.Future Lynx, the £1bn helicopters programme, is safe although the final number ordered will be cut marginally. AgustaWestland, the defence contractor, will be awarded an additional contract to upgrade existing Lynx helicopters for use in Afghanistan.A £16bn programme to build armoured vehicles for the army will be revamped. The MoD is expected to prioritise investment in the Scout reconnaissance vehicle rather than the Fres utility vehicle, in a blow to General Dynamics, the US contractor that this year won a provisional contract for the design.The Society of British Aerospace Companies wrote to Alistair Darling, chancellor, and Peter Mandelson, business secretary, before last month’s pre-Budget report urging them to consider the contribution the sector could make to an economic stimulus package.On Thursday night the MoD said it hoped to make an announcement “in due course”.Additional reporting by James Blitz
104;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-11-03T04:26:24Z;Delays hit MoD armoured vehicle plans;;The Ministry of Defence may revamp a £16bn ($26bn) programme to buy a new generation of armoured vehicles for the Army after mounting delays to the project.Six months after selecting General Dynamics to provide the design for the first variant of the new vehicles, the MoD has been unable to agree final contractual terms with the US group. A contract needs to be in place before the department can kick off the next phase.The project is for the Future Rapid Effects System (Fres), a medium-weight armoured vehicle set to replace a myriad different vehicles operated by the army, including the Saxon 430. A fleet of up to 3,000 vehicles could be built under contracts totalling as much as £16bn.Sources close to the process confirmed the MoD was discussing revisiting the acquisition process. They stressed Fres was unlikely to be scrapped as the capability is required by the army, but elements of it could be delayed or the acquisition process revamped entirely.“This has been the worst procurement programme ever,” admitted one source. “The entire procurement strategy has been bonkers,” said another source.The lack of clarity on the programme, coupled with the delays, has led to increased concern in the industry. Some fear the MoD’s chronic shortage of cash and last week’s announcement it was buying new vehicles for forces in Afghanistan mean it is unlikely Fres will remain in its present form.The MoD has split Fres into four industrial roles: it appointed a team from Boeing and Thales to oversee management of the programme last year as “system of systems” integrator.In May, it selected General Dynamics as the “provisional preferred bidder” to provide the vehicle design for the utility vehicle, but the two parties have been unable to agree certain elements of the final contract.The protracted negotiations have also delayed the competition for the vehicle integrator, the job of assembling the vehicle, fitting it out and making sure it can work with all the other high-tech systems in the forces. BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica are all in the running for the role.The MoD said it remained “committed to the Fres ­programme”.
105;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-10-03T08:52:53Z;Manufacturers: Gulfstream hopes to glide through gathering clouds;;If proof were needed that corporate aviation will never be a cut-price business, Gulfstream, the jet-maker based in Savannah, Georgia, provides it.“They’re the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac of the market,” says Cai von Rumohr, senior research analyst at Cowen and Company in Boston.Unlike the difficulties being experienced by the top-end auto manufacturers, however, Gulfstream is thriving, with an order book worth $19bn, up from about $9.4bn last year.That is music to the ears of General Dynamics, the US defence group that purchased Gulfstream in 1999 for $5.3bn in a move widely seen as an effort to boost its cash reserves in preparation for more acquisitions.Gulfstream is one of General Dynamics’ most profitable divisions. The business jet maker’s healthy order book helped its parent company in July to raise earnings guidance for 2008 to $6-$6.05 a share from the $5.55-$5.65 a share it had announced in January.An important part of Gulfstream’s success story came in March, when the company unveiled the G650, a brand new, ultra-long-range business jet. It was not prepared for the response.“Yes, we underestimated the demand,” concedes Joseph Lombardo, president of the aircraft-maker.That is something of an understatement. Gulfstream had been expecting to receive about 100 letters of intent for the new aircraft, according to aerospace analysts. Instead, it received 500, more than 100 of which are thought to have been converted into firm orders already.In part, that reflects the huge and growing demand for business jets outside the US market. “If you go back 10 years, the geographic distribution was 75 per cent North America, 25 per cent international,” says Mr Lombardo.“For the first time in 2007, international orders exceeded North American orders 53 per cent to 47 per cent, even as North American orders increased by some 30 per cent,” he says. “For the first half of 2008, international orders have outpaced North American orders 55 per cent to 45 per cent.”So far, orders for the G650 are more evenly split between customers in North American and elsewhere.However, Nicholas Chabraja, chairman of General Dynamics, said recently that he expects the proportion of non-US orders to grow, as more letters of intent are converted into orders.As the international market for corporate jets grows, so has demand for the top-end aircraft manufactured by Gulfstream. If anything, that reputation has been enhanced with the announcement of the G650, the largest, fastest and most expensive private jet on the market.Deliveries are due to begin in 2012 with a price tag of $58.5m, more than $10m above the next model down, the G550. The price will rise to $59.5m for aircraft delivered from the following year.The jet will have a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.925 – just beating Cessna’s Citation X, currently the fastest non-military aircraft on the market – enabling it to do New York-Los Angeles in four hours or New York-London in six hours.It is also capable of non-stop flights of up to 7,000 nautical miles at speeds of Mach 0.85 – an advantage for the business executive who values uninterrupted air travel from New York to Tokyo or Buenos Aires.That feature is particularly attractive to international markets. “Mid-East Sheikhs and the Russian oil barons, to value the ability to go global,” says Mr von Rumohr.With a cabin 2.6 metres wide and 1.9 metres high, the G650 will accommodate 18 passengers seated or eight sleeping in lie-flat beds – as well as a full kitchen and bar, satellite telephone service and wireless internet access during flights.Mr Lombardo says that, with these specifications, the new aircraft “is in a brand new market by itself”.That expresses the aircraft-maker’s hope that if the industry is entering the downside of a business cycle, the luxury end will hold up relatively well, buoyed by international sales.Moreover, although the used-aircraft market is growing, that market is much smaller at the top end of the industry. “We are in a completely different environment today from the one we were in in the post-9/11 era,” says Mr Lombardo. “Our backlog is strong and should see us well through the current economic environment.”Not everyone is convinced. Citing a worsening corporate aviation market, JP Morgan recently downgraded General Dynamics, saying there was “limited upside” after a “nice run”. The investment bank said the “softening bizjet market should eventually catch up with Gulfstream.”Another concern is the time from order placement to aircraft delivery, something that Mr Chabraja described in April as “problematic” in relation to the G450 and G550 models.The interval between an order and delivery ranges from 30 months for a G550 to 10 months for the G150.The popularity of the G650 could aggravate the problem. Originally, the company planned to have one production line for the G650 with a capacity of 45 aircraft per year and contemplated adding a second line in 2014, something that Mr Chabraja has acknowledged “is inconsistent with the demand”.Gulfstream says it is “looking very closely” at increasing production rates, although Mr Lombardo cautions: “It is neither a simple nor easy task to just ramp up production.”Meanwhile, the company is not resting on its laurels. It is widely expected to unveil the G250, its new super-midsize to large-cabin business aircraft, at the National Business Aviation Association annual meeting in Orlando this month.The G250 will be an updated version of the G200, and is expected to have superior performance, a bigger cabin and a larger baggage compartment that can be accessed in-flight.
106;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-08-25T22:31:07Z;Turner prizes US growth as legacy;;Mike Turner will go to his Christmas party this weekend. The 60-year-old retires as chief executive of BAE Systems on Friday and his executive team is taking him out for their traditional end-of-year dinner.“We are having Christmas early,” says Mr Turner in his final interview before stepping down.It’s likely to be quite a party. Mr Turner leaves after 42 years with BAE, having done 22 different jobs including serving as chief executive for the past 6½ years. Under his leadership the company has changed from a medium-sized, UK-focused aerospace and defence group into a global defence player with an order book of £38.6bn. Investors who stuck with him have seen the shares more than quadruple over the period to 471¾p.It has been an eventful reign. When Mr Turner took over in 2002, the company was locked in a fierce dispute with its then largest customer, the UK Ministry of Defence, over the terms for big defence contracts.He later defied the government by selling BAE’s stake in Airbus – leaving Britain with no direct stake in commercial aircraft manufacture – and pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy in the US that fuelled fears BAE would decamp to the other side of the Atlantic.For much of his time in charge, BAE has fended off allegations of corruption and bribery in relation to one of its most lucrative contracts: to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. Questions over the company’s ethical behaviour are unlikely to go away any time soon – the US Department of Justice continues to investigate BAE’s dealings in Saudi Arabia – and are perhaps the last piece of unfinished business Mr Turner leaves behind.He remains stalwart in his defence of the group, brushing aside suggestions that he had a blind spot when it came to ethics as “nonsense”. The company, he bristles, has never done anything illegal and “does more due diligence on advisers than any other defence company in the world”. He insists that the UK government, whose original al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia is the focus of the allegations, has been “100 per cent supportive in its discussions with the US government”.The Saudi deal’s contribution to BAE’s financial health should not be underestimated. The al-Yamamah contract, signed by the Thatcher government in 1985 and under which Britain supplied Tornado and Hawk planes to Saudi Arabia, is worth an estimated £43bn, including payments for support and maintenance.According to Mr Turner, the profitability of the contract proved crucial in the early 1990s when BAE was struggling with a lossmaking commercial aircraft business.Sorting that out was Mr Turner’s big break. In 1991, Sir Richard Evans, then BAE’s chief executive and later to become Mr Turner’s mentor, took him to lunch at J Sheekey, the ffish restaurant in London’s Covent Garden. The message was bleak: BAE’s regional commercial aircraft businesses were losing money – and lots of it.“We weren’t selling the aircraft, we were leasing them to airlines that often couldn’t afford them and went bust,” says Mr Turner.He argued that BAE should exit the commercial aircraft business, calculating that the shift would cost the company about £3.5bn. The board agreed and in 1992 BAE made what was then the biggest writedown in corporate history.“[Al-Yamamah] allowed me to spend £3.5bn to get this company out of regional aircraft,” says Mr Turner.BAE and its investors have continued to reap dividends from Saudi Arabia. The company last year signed a new contract to provide Eurofighter Typhoons to the country and there are more to come. BAE is in talks to provide training to Saudi pilots and ground crews. A deal on missiles is also on the cards.International expansion would not be possible if BAE’s UK business had not been put on a sound footing. Here, Mr Turner’s challenge was to repair relations with the MoD yet simultaneously make the UK military business more profitable.The biggest showdown came when he was just months into the top job. In December 2002 he was forced to issue a profits warning because of big cost overruns on two UK military programmes, the Nimrod maritime aircraft and the Astute nuclear submarine. The warning eventually led to a painful £750m writedown in the 2003 figures.Mr Turner insisted that BAE would no longer accept contracts which carried what it regarded as an unacceptable level of risk.The UK government was “destroying the defence industrial base of the UK”, says Mr Turner.The discussions led to today’s defence industrial strategy, which promotes partnership between government and industry. As the largest defence contractor in the UK, BAE is the obvious winner from the strategy but Mr Turner makes no apologies about his company’s dominant position on large programmes.“You can’t have competition. The defence budget of this country is not big enough as it is. It’s not like the US where you can have six or seven prime contractors on the back of a defence budget of over $550bn …It’s a question of one or none.”The chief executive locked horns again with the government in 2006 over BAE’s decision to sell its 20 per cent stake in Airbus. His motivation was twofold: not only had BAE decided to focus on defence but Mr Turner foresaw two problems for Airbus, namely its exposure to the US dollar, and competition from a resurgent Boeing that had decided to invest in a new family of aircraft to take on Airbus.“I could see BAE as a 20 per cent shareholder in Airbus having to do something it had never done before and put its own cash in at a time when it wanted to grow its defence business,” he recalls. “The government made it very clear to me it didn’t want me to sell. I was very unpopular again but I had to make the right decision for the shareholders,” he adds.The sale was one of the stepping stones towards fulfilling Mr Turner’s long-held ambition of expanding in the lucrative US defence market.“If you want to be the leading defence company in the world, you have to be in the US and you have to be big in the US.”In 2003, he thought he had found the deal that would allow BAE to bulk up its US business in one swoop. But talks with General Dynamics came to nothing. Undeterred, BAE pursued a more bite-sized expansion plan, buying first United Defense Industries and then Armor Holdings. Today, it is the sixth-largest defence company in the US and the third-biggest defence player in the world by defence revenues, although its headquarters have remained in the UK.What advice has he for his successor, Ian King, the company’s chief operating officer who takes over onFriday.“Keep the global strategy going” Mr Turner says. Nobody else is working with other countries to develop their defence industrial base.”As for himself, chances are that Mr Turner will be just as busy pursuing a new career as a non-executive director. He is on the board of Lazard, the investment bank, and will become chairman of engineering services group Babcock International this year. He is considering a further three offers, he says, though he will not elaborate.And what will the straight-talking Mancunian miss most from his time at BAE? “The team” is the unequivocal answer. And the least? “The bloody [Saudi] allegations.”

Both had fallen sharply in the previous session.Lehman Brothers shares fell 13 per cent to $13.07 amid reports that the Wall Street bank might sell part of its investment-management business and as analysts raised the possibility of further writedowns.Most other financial sector companies, with the exception of credit card providers, were in negative territory for the day. Among other big fallers were HSBC, whose depository receipts fell 2.5 per cent to $77.29; Wells Fargo, down 3.5 per cent to $27.79; and JPMorgan, which was 3.2 per cent lower at $35.58. Morgan Stanley shares were 3.8 per cent down at $38.08.American International Group fell back as analysts warned of the possibility of more writedowns. Its shares lost 5.9 per cent to $20.32.The S&P Financial Index was off 3 per cent for the day at 267.18, while the S&P Investment Banking Index was down 3.2 per cent at 106.30.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.9 per cent lower at 1,266.70 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.35 per cent lower at 2,384.36 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent at 11,348.55 points.Stock market investors responded to two pieces of economic news.Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy, jumped 0.7 per cent in July after a 0.2 per cent June increase, the fastest rise in monthly core producer prices since November 2006.Michael Woolfolk, a senior strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon, said: “The rise in core inflation is troubling. It is clear that headline inflation is spilling over into the core at an accelerating rate.”US builders slowed construction on new homes in July to the lowest annual rate in 16 years. The US commerce department said US July housing starts fell 11 per cent to a 965,000 annual rate, the lowest level since March 1991.That sent homebuilder shares to a three-week low. Shares in Centex Corporation were down 4.5 per cent at $14.05 and those in Pulte Homes fell 3.7 per cent to $12.07.In earnings news, several retailers issued downbeat results, as consumers continued to cut spending amid the slowing of the wider economy.Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, reported a 24 per cent drop in second-quarter profit.Home Depot said earnings fell to $1.2bn, or 71 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $1.59bn, or 81 cents a share, in the same period last year. The shares were down 3.7 per cent at $25.96. Retail group Target reported a 7.6 per cent drop in second-quarter profit. Its shares in fell 0.7 per cent to $49.72.Shares in retailers Saks and Staples dropped after both companies said that their second-half performances would miss forecasts.Saks shares fell 8.3 per cent to $10.29 after it reported its biggest quarterly loss in two years on discounts for women’s apparel and said second-half sales would be lower than it had forecast.The S&P retailers index was dragged down by the generally disappointing earnings news to stand at 2.7 per cent lower at 383.12. Hewlett-Packard reported a slight rise in second-quarter earnings after the market closed and its shares rose in after hours trading having ended the trading session down 2 per cent at $43.69.In corporate news, aircraft builder General Dynamics agreed to buy Swiss company Jet Aviation for $2.25bn in cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2008. Shares in General Dynamics were down 0.3 per cent at $91.99.The energy sector held up relatively well amid the wider sell-off, with most companies in positive territory as the price of crude oil made ground after falls in early trading."
108;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-08-19T18:41:47Z;General Dynamics takes over Jet Aviation;;General Dynamics, the US defence group and maker of Gulfstream business jets, is taking over the Zurich-based Jet Aviation for SFr2.45bn ($2.24bn).Jet Aviation is one of the world’s leading business aviation services groups with operations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North and South America. It has been owned for the last three years by Permira, the private equity group, which acquired it from the Hirschmann family.The sale has allowed Permira to secure the biggest profit for its investors since the credit crunch. The UK-based private equity group has achieved an almost four-fold return on its initial investment.Since acquiring Jet Aviation in October 2005, Permira has supported its expansion, acquiring Savannah and Mid Coast Aviation in the US and expanding in China and Russia through joint ventures and organic growth.The deal is the fourth exit of the year for Permira, which has also made healthy profits by selling its stakes in Intelsat, the satellite operator, Debitel, the German mobile phone operator, and Aearo Technologies, the US maker of protective equipment.Jet Aviation’s services include business jet maintenance, repair and overhaul, aircraft completion and refurbishment, fixed-base operations for business jet operators, and private jet management, charter and brokerage. It has a workforce of 5,600 and operations at 25 airports worldwide. Jet Aviation’s European and US aircraft management and charter divisions operate a fleet of more than 200 aircraft and provided more than 65,000 flight hours last year.Nicholas Chabraja, General Dynamics chief executive, said the acquisition would support one of the group’s core growth areas in business aviation services. “We will expand our participation in the business aviation industry well beyond that of our current operations,” he said. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.The takeover of Jet Aviation will transform the geographic spread of General Dynamics’ business jet services, adding operations at leading executive jet airports in Dubai, Jeddah and Riyadh, in the Middle East, Beijing, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore in Asia and at Moscow Vnukovo and several locations in Germany and Switzerland and at London Biggin Hill.The acquisition comes as the global business jet market is changing rapidly with much stronger demand coming from markets outside North America in the last couple of years.Traditionally the US has been the heartland of the global business aviation market, but demand from other markets is already accounting for the majority of new orders for business jets.The rapid growth in Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America is helping to ease concerns that were spreading among the aircraft makers and business jet operators that the industry could face a hard landing in the face of the weakness in particular of the US economy and the turmoil in financial markets.General Dynamics is already one of the world’s leading makers of business jets through its Gulfstream division, which vied with Canada’s Bombardier last year for industry leadership measured by the value of deliveries.Gulfstream, which operates mainly at the top end of the executive jet market, delivered 138 business jets last year with a value of $4.8bn, just behind Bombardier, which delivered 226 business jets with a value of $5.2bn and ahead of Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, with deliveries worth $3.9bn.

110;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-05-25T18:50:11Z;How the valleys drew in General Dynamics;;When Don Touhig, MP for Islwyn in south-east Wales, heard that General Dynamics, the US defence company, was thinking of coming to the valleys, he did not hesitate. A few phone calls later and Mr Touhig was showing the company around a new facility that had been built on the site of an old colliery.“I said forget about Newport, come to Oakdale,” recalls Mr Touhig. “They kept their word.”General Dynamics promised to establish research and manufacturing facilities at the Oakdale colliery should it win a contract to provide Britain’s armed forces with a high-technology communications system called Bowman.Mr Touhig’s rapid response paid off. General Dynamics won the £2.2bn contract in 2001 and today on the site of the old pits is a thriving business park employing hundreds of skilled engineers.Sandy Wilson, managing director of General Dynamics in the UK, says the company was won over by a combination of grants from the then Welsh Development Agency as well as “the immediate facilities” on offer. There was also a pool of local talent.“We were able to tap into activity that was going on in Newport and Cardiff and had the local universities as a source of some of the research and development,” he says.Since its arrival seven years ago, General Dynamics has invested more than £20m in Wales and today employs more than 850 people. Its operations in Oakdale and neighbouring Ashchurch have helped drive the local economy, underpinning the local supplier community.Allyn Williams, business director at Excel Assemblies in Baglan, says the US defence group was one of a number of companies that acted as a catalyst, prompting it to change its focus from consumer electronics to defence. The 80-strong company has won contracts worth more than £3.5m in the past four years from General Dynamics for cabling and electronics.The US defence contractor is not the only company to have been won over by the valleys in recent years. Serco, the support services company, Logica, the IT services group and EADS, the European aerospace and defence group, are just some of the companies that have operations in the area.There is a strong link with many of these companies and local universities. Together with the Ministry of Defence, General Dynamics is leading a £60m research consortium of high-tech companies and universities. Jointly funded by industry and government, the consortium has established a defence technology centre to develop research projects.Today, General Dynamics’ Welsh operations include system integration laboratories for the Bowman contract as well as the Fres programme, Britain’s most important military equipment programme. As part of the Fres process, the company was earlier this month chosen as the provisional preferred bidder to provide the design for a new generation of armoured vehicles for the army.But what of the future? With the initial Bowman contract delivered, General Dynamics’ turnover in the UK has tailed off from a peak of about £500m to a solid £350m, of which £300m is generated in Wales. Mr Wilson says if the Fres programme begins in earnest and its export business continues to thrive, General Dynamics’ business will continue to grow in the region.What is important, he says, is that even though “south Wales as a place does not look like it’s an obvious high-tech base, if you look at our supply base, there is everything from sandwiches to cryptography. There is lots of good stuff. It’s a question of being there, finding it and using it”.
111;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-05-19T21:22:02Z;BAE’s first lady of defence is riding high;;Stealth submarines or super-fast jet fighters usually capture the imagination of those following the defence industry. BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence contractor, is well known for building these but its more pedestrian armoured vehicles division has stolen the show recently.Armoured trucks and mine-resistant vehicles have been a sweet spot for the defence industry, with the ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan driving demand for better troop protection.Run by Linda Hudson, one of the few women at the top of the defence industry, BAE’s land and armaments division has enjoyed growth in excess of 70 per cent in the past two years, with more to come this year.“We thought 2007 was going to be our peak year: what we find in 2008 is increasing requirements throughout the world. We think 2008 is going to be the peak in terms of requirements tied to hostilities,” the US executive says in an interview with the Financial Times.There will, however, be “a gradual decline in demand” between 2009 and 2010.BAE’s land and armaments division has been one of the main contributors to the company’s recent profits surge, vindicating its expansion through large acquisitions such as Alvis and United Defense Industries. Last year’s $4bn (£2bn) US purchase of Armor Holdings, the maker of Humvee military vehicles, catapulted BAE to the top of the global armoured vehicle market.Armor was Ms Hudson’s first big deal after she was headhunted by BAE from General Dynamics, its biggest rival in armoured vehicles, nearly two years ago.The division is the US Army’s sole supplier of a range of cargo and troop transport trucks. Recently, it has won several multi-billion dollar contracts to build mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicles.The US represents 80 per cent of the division, largely driven by the MRAP vehicles.In a recent speech, Robert Gates, US secretary of defense, noted that there have been 150-plus attacks so far on MRAPS and all but six soldiers have survived. The casualty rate, he added, is one-third that of a Humvee, and less than half that of an Abrams tank.The big question is how BAE can find sustainable growth once the MRAP windfall tails off next year.Steve East, an analyst at Credit Suisse, forecasts that BAE will generate earnings before interest and tax of £1.73bn in 2008, with land and armaments generating a third of that.“MRAP is a big programme but it is very short-term,” says Mr East. “It is a one-off profit and not sustainable”. The task facing Ms Hudson will be to find orders to plug that gap. Mr East estimates the division’s ebit will drop from £553m in 2008 to £526m in 2009, though he still expects overall group ebit to rise.International expansion is one answer. Ms Hudson expects non-US sales to rise from 20 per cent of divisional turnover to 30 per cent. “We are doing business in 35 countries around the world, there is an ageing fleet of vehicles …that countries will have to replace or upgrade,” she says.In the UK, which accounts for most of the international sales, BAE is seeking a role on a £16bn programme to provide a new generation of 3,000 armoured vehicles to the Army.Today’s armoured vehicles or tanks are nothing like their predecessors, coming equipped with complex electronic and optical systems. Ms Hudson bristles at any suggestion that BAE is simply involved in a higher form of “metal bashing”, a sensitive issue for a company looking to prove itself equal to Lockheed Martin and Boeing in the most lucrative parts of the US defence market.“There are those that consider today’s fighting vehicles and tanks from a complexity point of view to be equivalent to a fighter jet,” she says.Since joining the company, BAE has become subject to an investigation into allegations of bribery by the US Department of Justice over arms sales to Saudi Arabia. BAE denies any wrongdoing. Ms Hudson insists the investigation has “never been an issue” in her business dealings and that not “a single customer” has raised it.In spite of working in an industry still dominated by men, Ms Hudson says after 36 years she has grown used to be being the only woman in a room.After studying engineering, she began her career at Harris Corporation where she helped design satellites and high-tech electronic devices.Like every good salesperson, she has road-tested products.In Sweden last winter she drove the BvS10 armoured all terrain vehicle over snow, hills and through forests. “The most dramatic ride I’ve ever had,” she says.
112;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-05-19T16:27:15Z;New aircraft: Buoyant demand prompts jet launches;;Manufacturers will deliver 13,200 business aircraft in the light to corporate-airliner sectors over the next 10 years, worth $300bn, according to a forecast this month from Bombardier Aerospace.That is a hefty rise from the 10-year forecast of 9,950 aircraft in Bombardier’s Business Aircraft Market Forecast a year ago, and helps justify a rash of new designs announced over the past year by leading manufacturers.There are concerns over a US downturn, but sustained demand in Europe and buoyant trends in orders from emerging markets such as the Bric nations – Brazil, Russia, India and China – shore up a collective order book worth, the Bombardier forecast says, 29 months of production.Expected deliveries from 2008 to 2017 averaging 1,320 a year are more than double the average annual rate of 620 during the past 10 years, putting in context decisions by aircraft makers to pour millions of dollars into filling gaps in their line-up.Bombardier itself recently announced the all-composite midsize Learjet 85, which is intended to seat up to eight passengers, cruise at up to Mach 0.82, and have a maximum range of 3,000 nautical miles (Mach 1, the speed of sound, is 662kts or 761mph in standard conditions at sea level). Price has not yet been announced but it is expected to be competitive with the Cessna Citation Sovereign’s $17.07m.First delivery dates have not been announced either – though 2012 or 2013 seem most likely. But the route to gaining the benefits that composites offer has been unveiled – Grob Aerospace, the Swiss-headquartered manufacturer of smaller aircraft, will develop and build the first three airframes at its German manufacturing plant.Niall Olver, Grob chief executive, says the company has gained considerable experience developing Grob’s SPn light jet, which is expected to win certification at the end of this year. He says its low-pressure carbon fibre airframe has shown that the material is not only light and fatigue-free, but also more environmentally sound than the alloys it is replacing, especially when the energy and materials consumed in smelting aluminum are taken into account.Makers of large civil aircraft have been seeking to capitalise on the benefits of using composites for structural components, which can include lower weight, larger interiors and lower-drag fuselage panels, but the pace of adoption of the technology has been stepped up by Boeing with its 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus with its A380 and A350.Among big makers of business jets, Hawker Beechcraft already uses composites for its Hawker and Premier fuselages. But the Learjet will be the first all-composite business jet of its size.Cessna is still wedded to the traditional building methods and its large-cabin 850 Citation Columbus will be made, like all other Citations, from aluminium alloy. The Pratt and Whitney Canada PW810 turbofans it has chosen, however, are claimed to be much more fuel-efficient and much less polluting than current-generation engines. The intercontinental Columbus, Cessna’s biggest and most capable business aircraft yet, is expected to run up development costs of $780m.Both the Learjet and the Columbus will use the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics system, a cutting-edge suite which includes features such as synthetic vision that will delight not only the pilots who fly these aircraft but also those passengers whose main focus is on safety.Embraer’s midsize MSJ and midlight MLJ business jets, approved by the Brazilian company’s board just a few weeks ago, will also have the Pro Line Fusion avionics suite as standard. The side-stick, fly-by-wire aircraft will cost Embraer $750m to develop, but the company will reap benefits of commonality similar to those from its smaller Phenom 100 and Phenom 300 jet.Gulfstream, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics, will spend an estimated $1bn developing its ultra-long-range, ultra-large cabin G650, which will have a maximum range of 7,000 nautical miles, the capacity to carry 16 passengers – and a top speed of Mach 0.925 that will allow it to wrest the civil aircraft top-speed crown from the Mach 0.92 Cessna Citation X.Dassault Aviation also has an aircraft in the pipeline – a super midsize jet to which it has given the working designation Falcon SMS. Apart from the fact that it will have Rolls-Royce engines Dassault is saying little, except that it is definitely committed to the programme. Deliveries could start as soon as 2014.A theme common to a number of these business jet concepts is a spreading of manufacturing burden across the industry – although this has given problems to some who have already moved in this direction, from the large such as Boeing with its Dreamliner, to the small such as Eclipse Aviation with its very light jet.One of the winners of this trend is Spirit AeroSystems, which is a risk-sharing partner with Gulfstream for the wings and engine housings of the G650, and a supplier to Cessna for the Citation Columbus. Fokker is also a risk-sharing partner with Gulfstream, on the tail structure and fuselage panels.
113;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-05-08T14:55:44Z;MoD contract goes to US group;;The Ministry of Defence on Thursday awarded the first big contract on Britain's most important military programme, in a sign that the recent deadlock over significant procurement decisions is easing.The MoD is asking General Dynamics of the US to provide the vehicle design for a new generation of armoured vehicles for the army.Future Rapid Effects System, or Fres, is a programme aimed at replacing some of the army's ageing vehicles, including the Saxon 430 armoured vehicle. Fres will see Britain spend up to £16bn on 3,000 vehicles over the next few years. General Dynamics has been named provisional preferred bidder for Fres.The announcement could end the scramble for one of the most hotly contested procurement programmes in recent years.General Dynamics had been competing for the contract against Nexter, a French company, and Artec, a German-Dutch consortium. Nexter mounted a fierce campaign to win the deal and promised early delivery of the vehicles.A decision on the winner of the design phase was expected last year but was held up after the resignation of Lord Drayson, then procurement minister. Industry analysts said the speculation at the time was that Lord Drayson wanted to award the contract to Nexter, while the army favoured General Dynamics.The award will be welcomed by the defence industry as the first sign of movement from the MoD on the programme. The department has been grappling with an estimated budget shortfall of £2bn in its current two-year budget cycle.Although the cycle ended in March, ministers and officials have yet to make a significant number of procurement decisions. One likely option involves deferring several decisions by launching a further planning round in 2009. The MoD is also considering launching a wider equipment review.Industry executives have privately expressed their frustration that the continued delays could lead to increased costs on programmes and potential job cuts.The MoD has yet to award a manufacturing contract for two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy but an announcement on this could be made within the next two weeks.
114;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-03-21T19:34:23Z;Sarkozy to press UK on military co-operation;;Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, will push for closer defence ties with the UK when he meets Gordon Brown, British prime minister, next week in a move that could influence Britain’s most important military procurement programme.Mr Sarkozy is understood to have written to Mr Brown in recent days, highlighting defence as one of the areas where he believes the two countries could benefit from co-operation. Nuclear energy is another area that Mr Sarkozy is expected to flag up as offering scope for closer links.In the letter, Mr Sarkozy is thought to have cited Future Rapid Effects System, the British army’s biggest procurement programme, which will give it a new generation of armoured vehicles, as one area where co-operation would help both countries. The programme will see Britain spend up to £16bn (€20.21bn, $31.73bn) on 3,000 vehicles.Industry sources say they expect Mr Sarkozy to press Mr Brown to select a vehicle designed by Nexter, the French state-owned company, when they meet in London next week.Nexter is competing against a bid from General Dynamics of the US, and the Americans are widely seen as the frontrunner. In a last-ditch attempt to influence the decision, the chairman of Nexter recently wrote to the UK defence ministry offering to provide the vehicles by 2011 – one year before the date set by the government.“France is very keen to see this joint interest on co-operating on defence. Fres is one of the items France sees as potentially one of the biggest for co-operation,” confirmed one French source.Industry sources said Mr Sarkozy was ready to offer the UK the chance to participate in a wide range of French army modernisation projects if it chose Nexter’s vehicle.Analysts say Nexter needs to find an industrial partner in the next few years if it wants to be able to take part in European competitions for the next generation of medium-armoured vehicles.Defence sources in Britain said they were doubtful the talks would influence the outcome of the Fres competition and that General Dynamics was still regarded as the favourite.Additional reporting by Alex Barker…………………………………………………………………………………..Euro and global slowdown hit expected French growthForecast rates of French economic growth were cut on Friday by Insee, France’s national statistics office, a day after Christine Lagarde, finance minister, conceded the government would have to lower its 2008 forecasts, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu in Paris.The economy will grow by 0.4 per cent in 2008’s first three months, instead of 0.5 per cent as earlier forecast, and by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, down from a previously expected 0.4 per cent. Insee said growth would be affected by the global slowdown and exports would be hit by the euro’s record highs against the dollar. Business investment would grow more slowly than last year because of wariness in the face of financial market turbulence.Ms Lagarde said on Thursday the government would publish “slightly lower” growth forecasts in mid-April. It had previously predicted growth of 2 per cent this year. She indicated ajump in consumer spending was evidence that the French economy was “fundamentally sound”.Household spending on manufactured goods rose by 1.2 per cent in February after January’s 1.3 per cent drop, compared with a 0.5 per cent rise expected by analysts. The rise was driven by stronger car sales.Insee said it expected consumer spending to remain resilient in the first half of 2008 despite rising food and energy prices. But it cut its overall 2008 growth forecast to 1.4 per cent from 1.7 per cent.
115;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-02-06T00:17:01Z;Franco-US group signs armoured vehicle deal;;"A Franco-American consortium has signed a contract to oversee management of a programme to provide the army’s new generation of armoured vehicles.Thales UK and Boeing signed the contract at the end of last week, the first to be agreed for the £16bn equipment procurement programme.The initial stage of the contract will last for six months and is worth £4m.The Ministry of Defence named the Thales-Boeing team as the preferred bidder last year, dealing a blow to British rivals BAE Systems, Qinetiq and Ultra Electroncis. All three were in the running for the role as members of different consortiums.The Thales-Boeing consortium will take on the role of the “system-of-systems integrator” (Sosi), responsible for co-ordination of the programme, including system management.The Sosi will be part of an alliance being put together for the Future Rapid Effect System (Fres) programme aimed at building and supporting a fleet of 3,000 vehicles. The alliance will include the MoD, the vehicle designer and a vehicle integrator.The contract signing comes amid speculation that delivery of the first set of vehicles could be delayed by up to two years from an original – but informal – date of 2012. This would be a huge blow to the army; General Sir Richard Dannatt, army chief, said last year that Fres was the priority after support for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Industry executives had expected the MoD to announce the winner for the next stage of the programme, to provide the vehicle design, last month. Three consortiums – General Dynamics of the US, Nexter of France and Artec, a German-Dutch consortium – have been competing for the role.A recommendation on the winning contractor has already been made, with industry executives believing General Dynamics to be the victor.However, the delay in confirming this has sparked speculation that the cash-strapped MoD may put back a decision to move ahead on final production, known as Main Gate.The MoD said: “The Main Gate decision is not a point in time. It is a point in the maturity of the programme. We are now in the assessment phase, which aims to reduce the risks in the programme.”Industry executives said last night that General Dynamics might be awarded a development contract instead, which would last for two years up to a Main Gate decision.The situation has been complicated in recent days with a last-minute intervention from the French consortium, which has written to the MoD restating its offer."
116;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-02-02T03:43:56Z;French company moves to salvage army bid;;The French company bidding to provide a design for a new generation of armoured vehicles for the British army has made a last-minute intervention to influence the outcome of the competition, amid rising speculation that its US rival has won.Luc Vigneron, the chairman of Nexter, has written to Baroness Taylor, the defence procurement minister, outlining additional proposals to sweeten his company’s bid.The intervention threatens to overshadow what is Britain’s most important military programme. The Future Rapid Effect System (Fres) deal will see the government eventually spend up to £16bn ($31bn) on 3,000 armoured vehicles.In the letter, Mr Vigneron said Nexter could deliver vehicles designed according to the British specifications starting in 2011, one year before the date set by the Ministry of Defence.Nexter is due to supply vehicles to the French army later this year, and in the letter, Mr Vigneron says that the French authorities have confirmed they would be willing to change their own delivery schedule to make the new date achievable. On Friday, Nexter confirmed the letter had gone out.Nexter is competing against offers from General Dynamics of the US and from Artec, a German-Dutch consortium. A recommendation on the winning contractor has already been made, and industry executives are speculating that General Dynamics has been chosen. The decision still needs to be approved by government, however, and Nexter’s intervention could yet change the outcome.Analysts also noted on Friday that Britain has in recent years been strengthening its ties with France on defence procurement programmes, including on aircraft carriers.A decision on the winner of the design phase had been expected last year but was held up after the resignation of the procurement minister then, Lord Drayson. Industry analysts said speculation at the time was that Lord Drayson had wanted to award the design part of the programme to Nexter, while the army favoured General Dynamics.Nexter added that the company planned to challenge evidence given to the Commons defence committee last week, which appeared to indicate there were no vehicles on the market to meet the army’s requirement.The Ministry of Defence said: “The Fres requirement was always for a bespoke vehicle, which would allow for future upgrades and meet the army’s needs over the next 30 years. The competition has been fair and scrupulous.”On Friday, General Dynamics, said: “The whole competition is predicated on the fact that there is not a vehicle that meets the UK requirement.”
117;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2008-01-23T19:49:18Z;Wall Street stages powerful rebound;;US equities staged a powerful rebound on Wednesday and broke a five-day losing run, led by financials as hopes grew that bond insurers will receive a hefty capital injection.At the close, the S&P 500 index had risen 2.1 per cent to 1,338.60 after falling to a low of 1,270.05 (down 3.1 per cent) in early trade.The recovery in stocks was powered by a 9.7 per cent swing in the S&P financials sector, which closed up 6.8 per cent.The sector gained appreciably during the afternoon when news broke that the largest US banks were under pressure from New York State insurance regulators to provide as much as $15bn in fresh capital to support struggling bond insurers, people familiar with the matter said.JPMorgan rose 11.9 per cent to $45.72, a six-week high, while Citi jumped 8 per cent to $26.36. Bond insurer, MBIA rose 32.6 per cent to $16.61 while Ambac rallied 72 per cent to $13.70.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the the recovery in the main benchmarks and closed 2.5 per cent higher at 12,270.17, and rebounded from a low of 11,644.81, down 2.7 per cent earlier in the day.Among the leading benchmarks, the Nasdaq Composite at one stage entered official bear market territory on Wednesday, down more than 20 per cent from its peak in October. A guarded outlook from Apple hurt sentiment for technology stocks.The Nasdaq closed up 1.1 per cent at 2,316.41, after falling 3.9 per cent to a low of 2,202.54 earlier in the day.Although Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profits on Tuesday, its lower outlook sent the shares down 10.7 per cent to $139, but up from an intra-day low of $126.14.Ahead of releasing results after the closing bell, Ebay rose 6.5 per cent to $28.90, after it hit a 52-week low of $26.02 on Tuesday.Motorola plunged 18.8 per cent to $10.01, after its quarterly net profits fell 84 per cent. The mobile phone maker also warned that its turnround strategy will take longer than expected.Earlier in the day, a number of big S&P sectors including energy, materials, technology and telecoms fell more than 5 per cent before those losses were completely reversed.There was a sense that investors who had previously sold banks and bought stocks exposed to the global economy and commodities, such as energy, materials and industrials had reversed that strategy.Traders also said that the use of some algorithmic trading systems were curtailed amid higher equity volatility and the breakdown of recent relationships between sectors. Equity volatility as measured by the Vix index rose 11 per cent during the day, before closing down 7 per cent as the market rebounded.General Dynamics said quarterly profit rose 42 per cent, and while the defence contractor projected lower full-year earnings and the stock rosse 0.3 per cent to $79.05.United Technologies reported a 23 per cent gain in quarterly earnings and reiterated its profit outlook sending the stock up 5.6 per cent to $70.98.Pfizer recorded quarterly profit and sales that exceeded estimates. The drugs group’s stock had rose 2.8 per cent to $22.86.Texas Instruments said fourth-quarter profit rose 13 per cent and stock rose 4.6 per cent to $30.30.As the fourth-quarter earnings season swung into a higher gear on Wednesday, investors were rattled by a further reduction in the outlook for profits.According to Thomson Financial, the estimated blended rate for fourth-quarter earnings, after the latest corporate results on Wednesday, projected a decline of 19.6 per cent.It is shaping up to be the worst quarter for corporate earnings since a decline of 21.5 per cent in year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings in 2001.The estimate for first-quarter earnings this year is a rise of 3.7 per cent, but that is down from a projected rise of 5.7 per cent at the start of the month, according to Thomson.Of greater concern for investors is how companies are failing to beat estimates.“In a definite sign that the earnings-led bull run over the last five years has ended, the percentage of companies beating earnings estimates is at 53 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2007, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2001,” said analysts at Bespoke Investments.“We have mentioned in the past that a big decline in the ‘beat rate’ would be an ominous sign, and the data is showing that this decline has come.”In spite of the rebound, sentiment among traders and analysts remains cautious.“Given an awful beginning for stock prices and the unlikely proposition for earnings to provide much relief near-term, we no longer believe that first half-equity-market strength will be achieved,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.He said a second-half rebound was now probable, but cautioned that “trying definitively to call the market’s bottom seems risky”.Citi also lowered its 2008 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 1,550 from a prior estimate of 1,675.
118;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-10-06T02:11:05Z;BAE misses out on army contract;;A contract for overseeing the management of the British army’s biggest equipment project was awarded on Friday to the UK subsidiaries of French and US companies, pushing aside bidders that included BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence manufacturer.The project is for the so-called Future Rapid Effects System (Fres), a medium-weight armoured fighting vehicle set to replace a myriad of different vehicles now operated by the army. Lord Drayson, defence procurement minister, said the vehicles were the army’s top equipment priority.Up to 3,000 vehicles could be built under contracts worth together as much as £16bn, increasing to up to £60bn if the costs of maintaining and upgrading the vehicles throughout their lives are included.The Ministry of Defence contract awarded on Friday to Thales UK with Boeing Defence UK was for the role of “system of systems integrator”, which is responsible for the oversight of the whole programme and ensuring the vehicles can communicate with other military assets.BAE had bid for the contract with a group led by Finmeccanica of Italy. Other losers included groups led by Lockheed Martin of the US and Qinetiq of the UK.BAE has already been eliminated from the contract to manufacture the proposed utility vehicle, the most common Fres variant for which about 2,000 vehicles are expected to be required. The announcement on the winners of that contract – between General Dynamics UK, the Dutch-German Artec consortium and France’s Nexter – is expected next month.BAE remains a bidder for other contracts, including for the vehicle integrator, responsible for integrating communications, weapons and other equipment into the vehicles. The size of the contracts also means that many other companies will be involved in the vehicles’ manufacture.General Sir Richard Dannatt, the army chief, said Fres was the army’s highest priority after support to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.In a speech in June, he said the army would be operating sub-optimally until Fres was introduced – which will not be until 2012 at the earliest.
119;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:29Z;Armoured vehicle revamp offers serious business;;Senior executives from big US defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics (GD), will be out in force at the Defence Systems & Equipment International show in London’s Docklands this week.But unlike the usual combination of glad-handing, schmoozing and tourism that characterises many international arms fairs, this time serious business is on the agenda.The British government is in what it hopes are the the final stages of deciding the future shape of its £16bn Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme, an ambitious plan to overhaul the UK army’s increasingly decrepit fleet of armoured vehicles, beginning in 2012.Across its 40-year life, the 3,000-vehicle programme – Britain’s biggest ever land systems project – could be worth as much as £60bn to contractors. When such serious sums are involved, even US companies, usually buffered by the Pentagon’s vast equipment budgets, sit up and take notice.“I don’t think some people realise that this is massive,” says Iain Burgess, head of aerospace and defence at Ernst & Young in London. “The impact of this programme will far outshadow that of the new aircraft carriers [ordered by the Ministry of Defence this year].”The new carriers have laid the groundwork for the transformation of the British naval ship-building industry, through the merger of BAE Systems’ and VT Group’s yards in Portsmouth and Glasgow. The FRES programme could have an equally profound effect on the armoured vehicle business, Mr Burgess says.As with the carriers, the future role of BAE, Britain’s biggest arms manufacturer, on the armoured vehicle fleet, will be central to the FRES procurement debate in coming months.BAE managed to establish dominance on the carrier project over Thales, its French rival, and saw off a challenge from KBR of the US. But this time it faces an arguably more serious threat from the big guns of the US industry.The MoD has split the FRES industrial roles into four. First, it is seeking a “system of systems” integrator (SOSI) to help provide the government with the expertise to run such a complex project and also determine how the armoured vehicles will plug in electronically with other battlefield “assets”, such as command and control systems, fighter jets and unmanned aircraft.Boeing, with its mixed experience of running the giant US Future Combat Systems programme, has teamed up with Thales to pursue this role, while Lockheed has joined with Ultra Electronics, a local UK supplier.Alison Wood, BAE’s strategy director, has argued that the company needs to play some part in the SOSI role to maintain its leadership in British armoured vehicles, and is thought to be considering an alliance with Italy’s Finmeccanica and possibly GD.The SOSI role has caused concern among interested companies because it remains unclear how wide the responsibilities run or the financial value of the contracts. Regardless, it will be fiercely contested because the winner would be in the box seat for any expanded role leading the entire development of the UK’s battlefield communications effort.Of even greater concern to BAE is the second role, the “vehicle integrator”. This appears to be the most lucrative position on the project, and the one where BAE could wield most power. However, rivals for the role – including GD, unless it teams with BAE, and possibly Lockheed – argue BAE may not possess the right skills to bring together all of the advanced electronic architecture on the vehicle, the key responsibility of the vehicle integrator.BAE rejects such claims and wheels out a familiar “British jobs and skills” lobbying tactic, arguing that failure to secure the role could sound the eventual death knell for its UK armoured vehicle business, also responsible for maintaining the rest of the British land fleet.The British manufacturer has already lost out on the third FRES role, the vehicle’s “design authority”. Its proposed vehicle failed to make a final cut, which will see the Dutch-German Boxer, an updated Piranha from GD and Nexter of France’s VBCI face off in a so-called “trial of truth”.BAE is confident it could still win the fourth and final role on FRES, manufacturing the vehicle at its Newcastle plant under licence from the successful vehicle designer. This “metal-bashing” role would, however, be little comfort if it lost out on the vehicle integration role.This is what makes the keen interest of the Americans so critical. Faced with the possibility of a decline in the mammoth US defence budget towards the end of the decade, Lockheed, Boeing and GD are eager to expand internationally.The UK is one of the most open markets in the world, despite BAE’s dominance, but of even greater interest to US contractors is that an armoured vehicle built in Britain would have excellent access to export opportunities.US companies looking to export are often hamstrung by the country’s draconian technology transfer legislation. A British-built product would offer a neat solution and the potential to sell thousands more FRES vehicles around the world.“As well as potentially opening up a lucrative part of the UK market, this a big reason why you have a lot of Americans queuing up to get involved,” Mr Burgess concludes. This week’s show should be testament to that.
120;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:28Z;Emerging markets to outbid Pentagon;;In the coming years, the global defence market is expected to continue to expand. While the US, the largest defence market, is predicted to remain strong in the short-term, emerging powers such as India are looking to provide new opportunities for the large defence companies.When emergency spending for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions is included, the Pentagon budget for 2008 runs neck and neck with the Dutch economy in terms of size.The top US companies – includingLockheed Martin Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, and, increasingly, European companies, such as BAE Systems and EADS – are still focusing on the American marketplace where the largest contracts are concentrated.But while spending for the “war on terror” should remain high in the years to come, defence companies are expecting tighter budgets overall when the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns start winding down. There is also likely to be a shift in priorities away from weapons procurement as the Pentagon sets aside money to build up the army and the Marines.There is a growing sense inside and outside the Pentagon that the spiralling cost of weapons programmes cannot continue at the current pace. Some companies also believe John McCain, the Arizona senator who has been a fierce critic of the growing cost of procurement, may return to bang the drum if his presidential campaign is not reinvigorated. For all of these reasons, the large companies paying more attention to newer markets – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Dassault and Saab – are among those eyeing the opportunity of supplying India with a new fleet of fighter jets to replace its ageing fleet of Russian-built MiG-21s.While India has traditionally bought from Russia and France, US companies may benefit from the recent warming in US-India relations. The US manufacturers in the fighter jet market – in addition to BAE and possibly Dassault – are also lining up for the battle to provide Japan with new aircraft to replace its ailing fleet of F-4s and F-15s.China’s emergence as a significant military power of the future however, will provide more limited possibilities for American and European defence companies because of restrictions, and concerns, about exporting there.For Europe’s biggest defence company, BAE Systems, its strategic decision to focus on the US, taken at the end of the 1990s, has appeared inspired of late, as the company profits from its position as the Pentagon’s biggest supplier after the big five of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon. At the same time, the potential pitfalls of an essentially “foreign-headquartered” defence manufacturer being too reliant on the US have been highlighted by the US Department of Justice’s decision to pick up the baton on a corruption probe into BAE’s Saudi arms deals.Many in the industry were surprised when the Department of Justice flexed its independent muscles and pushed ahead with the probe (which had been abandoned by the British), given the political cost of the US upsetting two of its key allies in the UK and Saudi Arabia.BAE has done a good job of putting an American face on its US business, which by some measures now accounts for about half of its sales – most notably under the leadership of Mark Ronald, the former head of the US business who maintains a figurehead role at the group. But it is still a British company, with a London headquarters, which may leave it vulnerable if US rivals raise the issue of national security.The strong historic performance of BAE’s US business went some way towards easing congressional or Pentagon doubts about its recent $4.1bn purchase of Armor Holdings, establishing the company as the world’s leading land systems group. Some had thought the Saudi controversy would scupper the deal, though it passed without trouble.Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, uses the deal to prove that it is “business as usual” for his company in the US. But BAE outbid all other parties in the Armor auction and the target company was not deemed strategically important by the US government. And BAE’s Saudi issues could still be used by rival lobbyists on future deals, if it comes into direct conflict with any of its bigger US competitors.BAE’s ambitions to break into the US top-five appear on hold for now, but not particularly because of the Department of Justice probe. As Mr Turner says, there is little appetite at the Pentagon for further consolidation among the top players, though this could change if the defence budget falls back from its record run.Suggestions that private equity buyers could be interested in cash-rich defence companies, which always appeared slightly fanciful given the political concerns, are also off the table as a result of the global credit squeeze.It will be interesting to see how BAE fares in the US if a troop withdrawal takes place from Iraq. It has benefited more than most through its ownership of the Bradley fighting vehicle. Lockheed and Boeing are less conflict reliant.Regardless of BAE’s travails, its European rivals would gladly swap places with the British group, though they lack the advantages of the “special relationship” between the US and UK.Italy’s Finmeccanica has seen some success in selling presidential helicopters and cargo aircraft, but is finding it difficult to secure defence electronic acquisitions.Similarly, EADS has had some helicopter success and is in the running to supply air refuelling tankers, though most experts still believe it will lose out to Boeing.It looks unlikely that continental Europeans will be able to move beyond being mere platform providers to dominant local companies such as Lockheed and Northrop, although the work will still be welcome and offers some evidence that the US is becoming slightly more open to international partnerships.Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, has used this argument to berate the European Defence Agency for looking to establish a unified European defence industry to challenge the US, though the chances of the Europeans getting their act together look as remote as ever.With the industrial crisis at its Airbus passenger jet subsidiary, a heavily weakened and cash-strapped EADS is no longer in a position to pursue its French rival, Thales.Instead, Thales is in the driving seat. It is considering bidding for parts of Safran, the French aeroengines, aerospace parts and telecoms group, and could also pursue Dassault – making Denis Ranque, the Thales chief executive, a surprise French defence industry consolidator-in-waiting.A tie-up between Thales and Finmeccanica on defence electronics appears more distant than ever, as Thales no longer needs the protection to ward off unwanted advances from EADS.The political implications of protecting Italian and French high-technology jobs also make this look like a non-starter. However, in the UK, the most important western defence market after the US, Thales appears to be facing a serious challenge.Finmeccanica has recently emerged as BAE’s biggest rival in the UK through its ownership of Westland Helicopters and an avionics business.Thales’ previous position as the natural counterweight against BAE dominance in the UK is no longer taken for granted.
121;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-04-23T22:17:57Z;Winter calls for more control;;Donald Winter, US Navy Secretary, is well placed to judge the defence industry as a former Northrop Grumman executive.His recent assessment has been harsh.In a blunt speech to a packed audience of naval officers, Pentagon officials and industry executives in Washington this month, Mr Winter berated companies for not investing enough in shipyards and called on his department to re-establish control over shipbuilding programmes.General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are the biggest companies involved in warship-building.The department had developed a bad habit of relying too blindly on its contractors, he said.Though he was happy for companies to make profit margins above 15 per cent, his comments put the navy at the forefront of a trend to wrest back more control of complex weapons projects from the large defence contractors, who dominate the US military landscape.

AT&T rose 4.3 per cent to $36.87 and led gains for blue chips.The group’s mobile unit, Cingular Wireless, reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter profit due to a surge in new customers during the period. AT&T fourth-quarter figures are due on Thursday.McDonald’s was a drag on the Dow as its shares fell 1.5 per cent to $44.16 after earnings met recently upward revised estimates.The restaurant chain’s shares hit a 52-week high last week. Technology companies were in the spotlight as the quarterly earnings season continued, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4 per cent to 2,466.28.It is now up 2.10 per cent for the year and leads the Dow’s rise of 1.3 per cent and the S&P’s 1.5 per cent gain so far in 2007.Yahoo shares rallied 7.3 per cent to $28.94 after the internet group’s fourth-quarter net income beat estimates late on Tuesday. Analysts cheered news that Yahoo would roll out its Panama search technology earlier than anticipated.Yahoo shares have risen 13.6 per cent this year, repairing some of its 35 per cent slide in 2006.Another technology company on the up was Sun MicroSystems, 8.7 per cent higher at $6.15. The maker of server and data storage products reported its first quarterly profit since 2002.Shares in RF Micro Devices jumped 13.7 per cent to $7.82 after the maker of mobile phone chips beat earnings estimates.Citrix Systems rose 6 per cent to $31.65 after the network infrastructure soft­-ware maker’s fourth-quarter profit and sales beat previous estimates and it reiterated guidance for the first quarter.Shares in Corning surged 11 per cent to $20.90 as the maker of glass and fibre optic products beat estimates. In spite of lower guidance for first-quarter sales, the company said it intended to keep prices firm.Shares in Ebay were up 4.8 per cent at $30 ahead of the release of the online auction house’s results after the close of trade.Not all technology shares were in the green. Advanced Micro Devices slid 8.5 per cent to $16.03 after its latest earnings were negative.Further talk of steel industry consolidation boosted the SLX, an exchange-traded fund that invests in steel.It gained 2.5 per cent to $48.86 after touching a record of $48.87.Shares in General Dynamics fell 1.3 per cent to $79.85, after the defence contractor’s fourth-quarter earnings missed estimates.
123;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-01-23T18:12:27Z;Behind the moral DNA of a great enterprise;;"Purpose
The Starting Point of Great Companies
By Nikos Mourkogiannis
Palgrave Macmillan $27.95The relative merits of short- and long-term approaches to running companies have been argued over for many years. Which is best: to focus on operational effectiveness and immediate financial returns or on longer-term strategic positioning? Neither, says consultant and author Nikos Mourkogiannis, in Purpose.What really matters is the even longer-term quality of purpose, which “is like your moral DNA. It’s what you believe without having to think . . . purpose becomes the moral engine of a company, the source of its energy.”Thus Mourkogiannis flatly contradicts Milton Freidman’s assertion that profit maximisation should itself be the purpose of a company. Only a clear – even idealistic – purpose, he says, can provide the direction, unity and mutual respect that binds a company to itself and its customers and creates a truly unique and exciting brand.Mourkogiannis’s early years shaped his outlook and instilled a lifelong quest for purpose. Born and raised in Greece during a vicious civil war, a horrific lesson came early, at the age of six. Communist insurgents visited his family’s village and shot and killed 52 women who refused to denounce the author’s father.After studies at Athens Law School and Harvard, a loathing of communism and fear for his country’s future drove Mourkogiannis to work for Westinghouse’s defence division and, later, General Dynamics. Along the way he helped mastermind the sale of F-16 attack aircraft to the Greek government during the 1980s.Then the Berlin Wall fell and communism died. Mour-kogiannis returned to Harvard to study business strategy and joined Monitor Company, the consulting firm founded by Michael Porter and Mark Fuller, Harvard Business School professors.Since then, consulting experience with hundreds
of chief executives has
convinced him that a
leadership-driven grand purpose is what distinguishes great companies. Purpose can be created only by leaders who take the time, possess the intellect and marshal the courage to posit and defend an overarching ideal, whatever the risks.One of the most interesting themes in the book is the author’s delineation of four essential kinds of purpose and his descriptions of the leaders and companies that have profited from them.The first is the purpose of discovery, which drives innovation and technological breakthroughs. IBM, Sony and Intel have thrived because of their quest for discovery. “A technical lead,” Mourkogiannis says, “can create a near monopoly, which generates high profits, and which in turn pays . . . to maintain the lead.”The second kind of purpose is excellence, inspiring leaders and companies to offer the best products and service possible, such as Berkshire Hathaway, Apple and BMW. In Warren Buffet’s case at Berkshire Hathaway, excellence is manifest in the commitment to invest every penny of shareholders’ money as if it were his own. With Steve Jobs and Apple, the purpose is to provide peerless ease of access to network-based services via iMac, iPod and now iPhone.Third is the purpose of altruism, or a wish to be genuinely helpful to customers, as with Wal-Mart, Marriott and Body Shop. But here is where the author’s arguments start to slip. While we are told that Sam Walton was driven by a burning desire to offer customers the lowest prices, that hardly seems altruistic, especially in the light of the myriad complaints by citizens of US towns whose high streets have been wrecked by Wal-Mart’s predatory pricing.Still, just about so far so good. It’s Mourkogiannis’s fourth category, heroism, that appears startling and ill-defined. He cites Ford, Microsoft and ExxonMobil as championed by heroic leaders. Given Ford’s decline in the face of Japanese competitors that build better cars, and the lawsuits levelled at Microsoft and ExxonMobil for everything from unfair competition to environmental damage, these seem poor examples of heroism.The author also tends to ramble misguidedly into the realm of philosophy in digressions that simply look pretentious.Still, the book is rarely dull and makes some re­freshing points about the value of integrity and having a genuine vision of one’s business. And it offers practical guidelines on how senior executives can identify and promote a sense of purpose.While a clear purpose defines most successful start-ups, it is harder to introduce to older companies that have been adrift for years. In order for business leaders to identify a purpose, says the author, it is crucial “to feel as deeply as you think – if you are uncomfortable with feelings or hostile to information you get from your gut, purpose is going to be a problem for you”."
124;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2007-01-17T08:33:20Z;Global defence outlook;;At a Pentagon dinner in 1993, US defence industry executives were warned to consolidate or die ahead of budget cuts. That “last supper”, as the event became known, seems a long way off now. Since September 11 2001, the FTSE global aerospace and defence industry index has returned almost 90 per cent in dollar terms, beating global equities’ rise of about 60 per cent. From its traditional hefty discount to the market, the global sector now commands a 15 per cent premium on multiples of both earnings and book value.Despite recent outperformance and earnings upgrades, investors should be getting nervous. First, profit levels are becoming punchy. Return on equity for the global sector has risen to 16 per cent, compared with an average since 1993 of 12 per cent. For the biggest stocks, such as Lockheed Martin and the UK’s BAE Systems, return on equity is running at well over 20 per cent. Unlike the stock market as a whole, it is easy to see how high returns might normalise for the defence industry. Most contracts are supposed to be priced at a small premium to cost. Sooner or later, customers – usually companies’ respective governments – may ask questions about value for money.Second, demand could slow if the US, accounting for half of global defence spending, becomes more isolationist after the Bush presidency. Last March, the Department of Defense forecast an 8 per cent real fall in its budget to $463bn for the year to October 2007. But include the huge “supplemental” budgets used to fund Iraq and Afghanistan, and total spending could rise by up to 17 per cent year-on-year to $652bn, says the International Institute for Strategic Studies.The lesson of Vietnam and Korea is that when wars end, spending falls sharply. Today, trophy projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter are hard to abandon. But the size of companies’ secure order books should not be overstated. In December 2005, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon had a combined backlog equal to 24 months of sales. Without a new US war, defence stocks look vulnerable.
125;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-10-29T22:05:48Z;L-3 signals end of acquisition spree;;L-3 Communications, the world’s biggest defence electronics manufacturer, has signalled an end to years of frenetic acquisition activity and indicated it would be open to takeover approaches.In an interview with the Financial Times, Michael Strianese, who was appointed chief executive of L-3 last week, stressed he was not actively marketing the company and had not received approaches but said it was the board’s duty to consider any bids.New York-based L-3 has been the subject of takeover speculation since its 74-year-old founder, Frank Lanza, died in June.Mr Lanza, an inveterate dealmaker and one of the most high-profile executives in the defence industry, built the company from scratch, starting with the acquisition of 10 unwanted defence electronics businesses from Lockheed Martin in 1997. L-3 is now the next largest Pentagon contractor behind the big five of Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.The company now finds itself in a potential sweet spot of military spending, with bigger companies coveting many of its defence electronics units, particularly in the crucial area of battlefield information and communication systems.Military equipment budgets are likely to come under growing pressure in the next few years, with more dollars being spent on maintaining existing weapons or upgrading them with new technology rather than developing new “platforms” such as fighter jets, warships and armoured vehicles.Since its inception, L-3’s sales have grown an average of 35 per cent each year, with about 25 per cent of that coming from acquisitions.Mr Strianese, L-3’s finance director before succeeding Mr Lanza as chief executive, said he expected that growth would slow considerably in the next few years, to about 7.5 per cent a year from organic growth and 7.5 per cent from acquisitions. The company has a $9.7bn market value and expected sales of about $12.4bn this year.“Continuing to grow the company at a rate of $10bn at a time is not going to be productive,” Mr Strianese said. “Growing so rapidly over the past nine years has been a huge success but it also meant that focusing on synergies was not the priority.”L-3 is made up of more than 80 often disparate businesses, one of the reasons that makes it difficult for potential suitors, which include BAE Systems of the UK, to put together a bid.Mr Strianese admitted the company was often perceived as a “loose confederation of companies acting independently. But that has to change at the size we are now.”
126;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-10-22T21:26:25Z;Minister hints BAE could move to US;;Britain would not prevent BAE Systems, the country’s biggest defence manufacturer, from becoming a US company – provided it retained a critical presence in the UK – the minister in charge of Britain’s £16bn arms acquisition budget has signalled.The company, which is seeking to boost its US business, has repeatedly indicated it could shift its domicile across the Atlantic.The comments in a Financial Times interview with Lord Drayson, the defence procurement minister, are the first indication from a government official that the government would not stand in its way.Lord Drayson said such a shift would be a matter for shareholders. The government’s concern was only to maintain British manufacturing capabilities and access to technology.He said the government was determined to keep the skills and capabilities within the country to make sure Britain maintained a healthy defence industry that could manufacture, maintain and upgrade equipment of strategic importance. But where the owners of those companies resided did not matter.Asked whether it would concern the government if BAE moved, Lord Drayson said: “I think questions like that are a matter for shareholders of BAE.“From the point of view of the customer, what we would be very concerned to see is that there would be no negative impact on the company’s ability both to supply us and to support the equipment it already has [supplied],” he said.So we’d be concerned about issues relating to technology transfer, to issues relating to capabilities and skills in the future.”“These are the issues that we are focused on.”The government still holds a £1 golden share in BAE, formerly British Aerospace, and can stop anyone buying more than 15 per cent of its stock.The company has said it is seeking more than 50 per cent of its revenues from the US, the largest defence market in the world, up from 38 per cent in the first six months of this year.Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, has said that if it was earning 60-70 per cent of its revenues in the US, it would be difficult to remain a UK-based company.He has also said that BAE would be interested in exploring a merger with one of the main US defence manufacturers.Lord Drayson’s comments suggest the government would not rule that out, providing there were guarantees about the retention of indigenous capacity in the UK. About 50 per cent of BAE’s shareholders are US residents and the company has been subject to takeover interest in the past from big US defence groups such as Boeing and General Dynamics, though this was when BAE was at a low ebb after a series of problems on big UK weapons programmes.Mark Ronald, head of BAE’s US business, said in an August interview with the FT that he doubted that the UK government cared where BAE had its headquarters. “I just don’t think it matters. There are some companies where nobody knows where the hell their headquarters are. Governments are primarily concerned with national security and jobs. If push came to shove, I am not convinced the [UK] government is really going to care whether we are in Stirling Square [BAE’s London head office], New York City, Brussels or somewhere else.”
127;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-10-16T17:06:49Z;Embraer: Brazilian manufacturer aims to break into big league;;Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, has set its sights on breaking into the established ranks of the world’s leading business jet makers.In the last 10 years it has already become the world’s leading maker of regional jets – commercial aircraft of up to 100 seats – overtaking its Canadian rival Bombardier.“Our vision is to cover every niche of the market, but this is a development step by step,” said Mauricio Botelho, Embraer chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times. “It is progressing on a very firm timescale. In 10 years’ time we will be a very relevant player.”Turnover from corporate jets was forecast to rise from less than $200m last year to more than $600m in 2006, he said Mr Botelho has been the architect of the emergence of Embraer as one of the world’s leading aircraft makers and he is intent on building business jets into a second leg for the group alongside regional jets.The business jet sector is far more fragmented than regional commercial jets, where Embraer and Bombardier are the only substantial players.The Brazilian group faces tough competition from Gulfstream, a subsidiary of General Dynamics, and Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, both of the US, Bombardier of Canada and France’s Dassault.Another player, Raytheon Aircraft, is being offered for sale by the parent Raytheon group, the US defence and missiles concern, which is seeking to concentrate on its core defence business.Raytheon said in the summer that Credit Suisse, the investment bank, had been hired to explore a “potential sale of the business, an initial public offering or spin-off to shareholders or some combination thereof.”Embraer’s first foray into business aicraft has been focused on its Legacy 600, a super midsize business jet derived from its E145 regional jet. Deliveries of the Legacy, priced at $24.7m and with capacity to seat up to 16 passengers, are building up to around three a month. The aircraft was launched at the UK Farnborough airshow in 2000 and first entered service a year later.The group shipped 13 Legacy 600s to customers in 2004 and 20 in 2005. Deliveries are expected to rise to 25-30 a year in 2006 and 2007.It is making another incursion into the market at the top end with the recent launch of the Lineage 1000 jet in the ultra-large class of aircraft based on airliners. Derived from the E190 regional jet, the Lineage 1000 is expected to enter service in the second half of 2008, with 3-4 deliveries planned for 2009.Priced at $40.95m and with a capacity for up to 19 passengers, the Lineage 1000 will have a range with eight passengers of 4,200 nautical miles (7,800kms) allowing it to fly non-stop from London to New York, Moscow to Tokyo or Dubai to Tokyo or Johannesburg.Embraer’s biggest gamble to date, however, in rolling out its corporate jet strategy is the development of an all-new family of aircraft at the bottom end of the market, as it seeks to be one of the leading players in the newly emerging market segment for very light jets.As at the end of June Embraer had a total order backlog of $1.25bn for business jets, and it had already taken 235 orders for the new Phenom 100 and 300 jets announced in the first half of 2005.Deliveries of the Phenom 100 very light jet are due to begin in mid-2008 with production of 15-20 aircraft planned by the end of that year. Deliveries of the Phenom 300 light jet should start in the second half of 2009 with combined production forecast to total 120-150 aircraft.The Phenom 100, priced at $2.85m (at January 2005 economic conditions), will seat four passengers and have a range of 1,160 nautical miles (2,148kms), while the Phenom 300 light jet will have room for 9 passengers and a range of 1,800 nautical miles (3,334kms). It is priced at $6.65m (January 2005 conditions).Embraer’s attempt to break into the very light jet segment was given significant support earlier this year when it was chosen by JetBird, a start up Geneva-based company, that is planning to introduce one of the first pan-European air taxi services.JetBird placed a firm order for 50 Phenom 100 jets with options for another 50 aircraft. The contract allows JetBird to convert the positions into either Phenom 100s or 300s, and it is due to take delivery of its first aircraft in April 2009.Domnhal Slattery, the founder of JetBird and a former head of Royal Bank of Scotland’s aviation capital division, says the group is seeking “to revolutionise the executive travel market in a manner similar to the low-cost airline transformation of the commercial air travel market.”The Embraer Phenom aircraft has been chosen, he says, to achieve high aircraft utilisation and efficient turnaround times in order to keep operating costs low.With the use of the Phenom 100, chosen against US competitors such as the Eclipse 500 and the Cessna Mustang, JetBird is aiming to bring executive jet travel to a market for whom it has previously been too expensive, he says.JetBird is seeking to develop Europe’s first “low cost, on-demand, executive jet service” initially from Zurich in 2009, and subsequently from other major European cities.

129;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-10-05T17:35:40Z;Using IPOs to prove value of M&A targets;;Several years ago, eBay was in negotiations to acquire PayPal in order to boost its payments settled online and obtain PayPal’s antifraud capabilities. At the time, PayPal was privately held, and the two parties were unable to come to terms on price. PayPal opted to go public, the equity market certified the value that the company claimed it was worth, and eBay completed the acquisition for $1.5bn a few months later – at a 20 per cent premium.This deal illustrates the widespread phenomenon of “dual tracking”, whereby a company’s initial public offering (IPO) and sell-out occur in sequence over a short period of time. The PayPal example represents public dual tracking, whereby a company carries out the IPO only to be acquired shortly thereafter. Private dual tracking has become increasingly frequent and involves companies filing to go public and selling out before the equity offering takes place. Recent cases of private dual-tracked businesses include Noveon, Advertising.com, Borden Chemical and Brightmail.These examples challenge some of the received wisdom on IPOs and the decision to go public. Traditionally, IPOs have been viewed as pure financing choices that are independent from overall strategy and “real” investment decisions. IPOs are also routinely portrayed as natural end-states for successful entrepreneurial companies. However, these cases reveal that IPOs have implications for M&A markets, the corporate development decisions of other companies and the strategic direction of entrepreneurial companies. Therefore, rather than evaluating the benefits or costs of going public in isolation, companies need to account for a broader set of considerations, such as how the IPO might affect their future growth plans or even their ability to exit through a takeover.At first glance, the dual-tracking phenomenon is puzzling. Why would businesses work to go public, only to be acquired by another company? Why would they bear all of the direct and indirect costs of going public rather than simply selling outright? In fact, using IPOs to “tee up” companies for sale appears to be a costly proposition. Aside from the direct loss of managerial time, registration and underwriting costs alone average 14 per cent of the proceeds raised. Moreover, the practice of discounting the share price on the day of the offering, or “underpricing,” can also represent a substantial indirect cost of going public.The answer to this puzzle can be found in the intrinsic features of some M&A deals, as well as in the ways IPOs work to address fundamental problems in acquisitions. In this article, we will discuss some of the economic rationales for the dual-tracking phenomenon. Subsequently, we will cover some of the evidence that is emerging on dual tracking and the alternatives that buyers and sellers have at their disposal in conducting M&As.How M&A targets can be like used carsIn 2001, George Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work on information economics. The classic market for “lemons” example offered by Prof Akerlof describes how the market for used cars can fail because of the information asymmetries between a buyer and seller that arise due to the latter’s experience with the vehicle. In the absence of appropriate remedies, such as warranties, reputation and so on, buyers will discount their offer prices for all used cars and, as a consequence, the sellers of high-quality vehicles will no longer be willing to trade.Indeed, information asymmetries crop up in an array of settings, including M&As. During M&A valuation and negotiation processes, an acquirer needs to be able to discern the value of a target, and the parties need to agree on a price for the transaction. The acquiring company collects information on the target during the due diligence process, yet it often still remains at an information disadvantage in M&A negotiations. Buyers, therefore, face the risk of “adverse selection”, or overpaying and winding up with a “lemon”. Because M&A targets can have attributes that are only understood after purchase, costly surprises emerge during the post-merger integration process.For their part, sellers have an incentive to misrepresent the quality of the company and realise higher gains from the deal. In short, the seller has a credibility problem that is rooted in the one-shot nature of sell-outs, and its claims will be discounted accordingly. As a result, sellers of good companies run the risk of not receiving fair value for their assets. Therefore, it is in each party’s interest to address the problems posed by information asymmetries in M&As.Academics in strategic management and financial economics are now using the insights from information economics to understand when asymmetric information can adversely affect the efficiency of acquisitions, what remedies might be available, and how buyers and sellers can design deals to address these challenges.The value of dual trackingTo understand why the IPO process can facilitate M&A transactions, it is important to recognise that the problems noted above are especially likely to be present for entrepreneurial targets. Little historical or codified information tends to be available on privately held targets, particularly younger ones. Moreover, many entrepreneurial companies suffer from the lack of legitimacy that comes with time and the accumulation of business relationships. It is also the case that the bulk of the value of entrepreneurial companies comes from future growth opportunities and intangible assets, which are notoriously difficult to value.Going public can reduce the problem of adverse selection in two ways. First, an IPO can directly reduce the information asymmetries between the company and prospective bidders. This is due to the credible information that becomes available through disclosures made in response to regulations for registration and subsequent listing. Moreover, in valuing companies, the equity market works to aggregate heterogeneous information on the issuer.Second, by going public, a company sends signals to potential acquirers, and these signals reduce the effects of information asymmetries that are bound to remain. For instance, the mere fact that the company is able to bear the costs of going public can suggest to bidders that there is a higher probability that it is of higher quality, compared with companies that remain private. In effect, the new issue market works as a screening device, and it will be tougher for companies to pass through this screen in cold, rather than hot, IPO markets. Targets can also signal value through the underwriter that assists in taking the company public. The market for underwriters’ services is segmented in such a way that the best companies tend to be taken public by the most prominent underwriters, so potential bidders can use these associations to help screen targets.Going public offers many possible opportunities for companies to send signals about their quality. These include choices such as how much ownership to dispose of rather than retain, how to price the offering, and so on. David Langstaff, CEO of Veridian, an IT security company acquired by General Dynamics in 2003, has emphasised the need to make the right “first impression” when going public. He maintains that this is achieved by thinking through which exchange to list on, which investment banker to use for the IPO, and which analysts will cover the company once the offering has taken place.Recent research is offering evidence that IPOs can have important implications for M&A deal-making. This research concerns overall M&A patterns as well as performance outcomes, so it can inform a business’s acquisition policies and tactics on both the buy and sell sides of deals. Below are a few of the conclusions coming out of this emerging work by us and others.■ Dual tracking can offer higher premiums to targets than outright sales A recent study by James Brau of Brigham Young University and Ninon Kohers of the University of South Florida found that public dual-track targets generally earned a 24 per cent higher premium than private companies that sold outright. Private dual-track targets enjoyed a 26 per cent higher premium compared with private targets selling outright.■ Buyers can also benefit from targeting IPO companies Despite paying higher premiums for private companies pursuing IPOs, buyers do not earn lower abnormal returns. A recent study by Qin Lian at the University of Kansas attributes this to the IPO registration process improving the matching of companies in the M&A market.■ Certain companies are better candidates for dual tracking than others Our analyses have shown that companies with substantial intangibles are more likely to go public and then sell out, rather than divest outright. By contrast, companies with modest intangibles are relatively easy to assess and can be sold efficiently while still being closely held.■ Some IPO companies are particularly likely to be acquired Going public can offer signals on company value, but the strength of these signals will vary significantly from issuer to issuer. For instance, companies that are taken public by venture capitalists are more likely to be acquired after they go public than companies that did not have such backing. Also, companies that are associated with prominent underwriters are more likely to be acquired after their IPOs than companies taken public by less reputable investment banks.■ Dual tracking affects M&A deal structures The risk for acquirers of adverse selection will be greatest when they pay for the target using a lump sum cash payment. In contrast, by using stock to finance the transaction, buyers can transfer part of the overpayment risk to the target, since the value of stock received by the target will reflect the performance of the combined entity.Targets can be reluctant to accept the bidder’s stock, since buyers are more likely to pay with overvalued shares, but high-quality targets are able to enjoy higher stock prices, instead of receiving a lump sum in cash. Our research found that the odds of using stock rather than cash to finance M&As are one-and-a-half times greater for outright acquisitions of private targets compared with newly public targets.■ Dual-tracked companies can attract a broader set of acquirers IPO companies that become acquisition targets are more likely to be bought out by geographically distant acquirers when their IPOs are backed by venture capitalists or prestigious underwriters. The likelihood of a newly public company being acquired by a remote, rather than a geographically close, bidder also increases with the offering’s underpricing.Managing adverse selection in M&AsIt is important to emphasise that acquirers will need to find other means of dealing with adverse selection when choosing to acquire privately held targets. Moreover, dual tracking is only one way for sellers and bidders to address the risk of adverse selection in M&As.Our discussion has specifically focused on how IPOs can reveal information on target companies and send signals on their quality, but there are alternative ways to tackle the problem of adverse selection, particularly when conducting deals with privately held targets. One way around the problem is to form a limited alliance before proceeding with the acquisition.A joint venture allows companies to combine assets in a distinct, jointly controlled business which can help the acquiring business understand the target’s resources better. Philips, for example, sold a 53 per cent stake in its domestic appliances unit to Whirlpool, so that the latter could understand the strength of the dealer network before completing the acquisition.If a company decides to proceed with an acquisition of a private company, what might it do to manage the risk of an adverse selection? There are two additional tactics. First, target selection needs to be considered carefully because the risk of adverse selection will be higher for certain closely held targets than others.Companies are less likely to be at an information disadvantage when acquiring companies in their sector or that are geographically close. In particular, acquirers are better positioned to understand and evaluate the resources, products, relationships and claims of a nearby target or direct rival than other sellers. It follows that bidders that are geographically distant or that hail from other industries have the most to gain from the signals a target company sends when undertaking an IPO.Second, deal structuring needs to be given careful consideration. Companies can address the risk of adverse selection by the way they put together M&A transactions. The acquisition of Skype is a case in point. In the summer of 2005, the internet telephony operator contemplated a partial acquisition by News Corp, but the companies could not agree on price. Several months later, eBay acquired Skype for $2.6bn in cash, and Skype would receive an additional $1.5bn by 2009, provided it met performance targets.This deal structure, which is known as a contingent earnout, reallocates overpayment risk from the bidder to the target, and is most often used in acquisitions of private companies. High-quality sellers benefit by being able to obtain a greater total payment and are able to provide a credible signal of their worth. However, earnouts present several important drawbacks, one of which is the need to measure the target’s independent performance after the deal has been completed. This consideration implies that earnouts are not suitable for deals with high integration requirements.The phenomenon of dual tracking and these alternative ways of addressing adverse selection in M&As have important implications for acquisition deal-making. On the sell side, companies need to consider IPOs not as pure financing choices or as natural end-states. Rather, IPOs need to be considered as strategic choices that have consequences for future transactions.On the buy side, corporate development staff and advisers need to add IPOs to their M&A toolkits. IPOs can play important roles in facilitating M&A transactions and reducing costly surprises that crop up during post-merger integration. They are particularly relevant for certain types of transactions (diversifying acquisitions) and they influence the design of M&A deals (cash versus stock versus earnout). By paying attention to the risk of adverse selection in M&As, sellers and buyers alike can improve their odds of capturing value from such transactions.Jeffrey J.

But Boeing has a far smaller presence in the country than US rivals General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.US defence companies have cash to spend and are eager to expand internationally to compensate for an expected flattening of budget growth at the Pentagon over the next few years.Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s $31bn-a-year defence business, said his company had done business with the UK for 50 years but needed to adapt to a radical change in procurement strategy at the Ministry of Defence.The UK has scrapped a 20-year policy of buying most weapons through open international competition.Instead, it will seek to ensure intellectual property for key military systems resides in the UK, though it is relaxed about whether this is through local subsidiaries of US or European companies.“With the new policy, obviously having more Boeing badges in the UK is something we are looking at really hard,” Mr Albaugh said.“We have about 600 people now but I would not be forthright if I did not tell you we were going to respond.”Though potential acquisitions were expensive and Boeing would not overpay, he said the group was looking all the time.“It is really a question of where we have gaps and we clearly have one in how we generate intellectual property in the UK.”Mid-sized UK companies with defence businesses such as Ultra Electronics, Cobham and Meggitt have seen share prices spike recently on speculation they could become targets for larger US or European industrial groups.Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, chief executive of Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group that owns Westland Helicopters in the UK, said recently he would like to buy more British companies.Northrop Grumman, another top-five US defence contractor, is also looking to beef up its UK defence and homeland security operations through deals.An acquisition of an electronics specialist such as Ultra would be unusual for Boeing, which describes itself as a “systems integrator” rather than an acquirer of technology companies.Mr Albaugh would not be drawn on potential targets, other than to say Boeing had relationships with 250 UK suppliers.US acquirers might be tempted by companies that offer support services to the MoD such as Serco or IT systems houses such as Detica, Anite or SciSys.A senior industry adviser said he expected consolidation of the UK defence sector would gather pace in the next “six to nine months”.

Gold miner Newmont Mining fell 3.5 per cent to $44.14, while copper producer Freeport McMoran slumped 4.3 per cent to $52.00.Microsoft announced that its Zune digital music player – a rival to Apple’s iPod – would be available for purchase at Christmas, which helped push its shares up 1.4 per cent to $26.33.Sovereign Bancorp jumped 3.2 per cent to $21.21 after the company’s chief executive said at a conference that he expected to sell the bank.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent, or 1.79 points, at 1,316.28, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 1.06 points, at 2,228.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent, or 15.93 points, lower at 11,527.39.Stocks turned lower after the latest economic data from the Commerce Department. Retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2 per cent in August, compared with most analysts’ expectation of a 0.1 per cent decline in sales.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors, said the retail sales news was still not enough to change investors’ mindsets.“Today, I don’t think we had news that was surprising enough to get the fence-sitters off the fence,” he said. “That big question of whether we are heading towards a hard or soft landing is still very much unanswered. What is needed is news that is going to get investors committed to the bull case or the bear case.”Bear Stearns beat analyst expectations when it reported a 16 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to $139.68. Bear Stearns is the third investment bank this week – after Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers to report better-than-expected results.Defence and aerospacegroup General Dynamics rose 2.4 per cent to $70.88, after it said it would increase aircraft production by 15 per cent next year due to rising international orders.The lower fuel costs were a boon to industrial chemical makers, and DuPont gained 2.3 per cent to $41.43.Genzyme gained 2.7 per cent to $68.35 after it said interim results from a drug trial showed that its multiple sclerosis drug performed better than Serono’s Rebif.XM Satellite Radio leapt 9.4 per cent to $13.69 after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Shares in chipmaker Xilinx fell 4 per cent to $22.41.
132;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-07-06T20:49:46Z;Wall St recovers some poise;;Wall Street finished higher on Thursday, recouping some of the previous session’s losses as tobacco stocks received a boost from a legal decision and interest rate concerns were soothed by weak manufacturing data.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, or 3.17 points, at 1,274.08, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 1.75 points, at 2,155.09.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent, or 73.48 points, at 11,225.30.The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell more than expected in June, giving a fillip to interest rate-sensitive markets.“The economy is showing some level of moderation but not falling off a cliff,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.Tobacco stocks surged after a Florida court rejected a $145bn punitive damages award against tobacco companies.Altria was the most heavily traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange and the biggest gainer in the Dow, jumping 6 per cent to $77.76, its best day since October 2005. The ruling clears one of the hurdles to Altria spinning off its 86 per cent stake in Kraft, which fell 2.5 per cent to $30.37.Railroad stocks came under pressure after an investigation into a train crash encouraged government regulators to prevent railworkers from working irregular hours. CSX lost 3.4 per cent to $68.42, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe fell 3 per cent to $76.36.Peoples Energy jumped 8.6 per cent to $39.06 after it said it was in talks with WPS Resources concerning a possible merger of the two energy companies. WPS Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $48.14.Tie-up news was also behind a bounce for coal company Peabody Energy, which jumped 5 per cent to $57.16 following news that it would buy Australian rival Excel Coal for $1.34bn. Analysts expect synergies to result from the deal.Retail stocks were closely watched as leading stores reported sales figures for June. Costco dropped 1.8 per cent to $55.85 on weaker than expected sales data.Other retailers did better after beating Wall Street forecasts with strong June sales. TJX, owner of Marshall’s and TJ Maxx, rose 5.1 per cent to $23.37, and Nordstrom jumped 3.8 per cent to $37.11.Consumer staples were also in demand. Dean Foods gained 5.1 per cent to $37.82 following an upgrade from Merrill Lynch, which changed its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”.Ebay fell 5.3 per cent to $26.85, its lowest level since November 2003. On Thursday, Citigroup cut its price target on the stock, as Ebay announced a management shake-up.General Dynamics pushed up 3.1 per cent to $67.00. After the bell on Wednesday, it announced it had received a $137m contract from the US Army.
133;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-05-01T21:18:01Z;Netjets Europe adds to its fleet;;Netjets Europe, the biggest operator of business jets in Europe, is adding a further 30 aircraft this year valued at $445m at list prices to expand its fleet by a third to 119 by the end of 2006.The group, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said it would have invested nearly $750m in new aircraft in the two years 2005 and 2006 with large orders placed chiefly with Raytheon and Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron, of the US.It is also purchasing long-range jets from Gulfstream, a subsidiary of General Dynamics of the US, which have the capability to fly non-stop from London to Beijing or to Los Angeles, and from France’s Dassault.Mark Booth, Netjets Europe chief executive, said the group had ended a decade of losses since its launch in 1996 and had been achieving an operating profit since the second half of 2005.He said the European operation would be profitable at an operating level in 2006 and there was a “50-50 chance” of achieving a net profit for the first time this year. “I guarantee a net profit in 2007,” he told the Financial Times.Netjets Europe has been expanding rapidly and claims to be the ninth-largest airline in Europe by fleet size. It has a commercial air operator’s certificate (AOC) through Netjets Transportes Aereos (NTA), based in Lisbon, which is regulated by the Portuguese civil aviation authority. To qualify as a European union carrier it is 49 per cent owned by Netjets of the US and 51 per cent by European investors, whose identity it refuses to disclose. It has become one of the leading recruiters of pilots in Europe with a pilot workforce of 580 in a total European workforce of around 1,200, which includes 380 at its Lisbon operations headquarters and 100 sales, marketing and finance staff in London.Mr Booth, the former News Corp executive and former head of BSkyB, said Netjets Europe had recently signed its 1,000th customer after recruiting 400 new customers in 2005 to its corporate fractional ownership and card membership programmes.It has grown from a base of 89 customers in January 2002, and Mr Booth forecast it would have more than 1,200 by the end of the year.The recent expansion of the customer base has come through the popularity of jet card membership schemes in Europe, which are attracting an increasing number of wealthy individual customers, who prefer the simplicity of buying private jet travel by the hour rather than purchasing a fraction of ownership of an aircraft.Prices for the Netjets card schemes start at £85,000 ($155,000) for 25 hours of occupied flying time of a small private jet.Mr Booth said the business was still chiefly based on fractional jet ownership by big European corporations, however, which accounted for 78 per cent of the flying hours of the Netjets Europe fleet and included 10 of the companies in the Eurostoxx 50 index of leading European corporations.The improvement in the profitability of the Netjets Europe operation has been in contrast with the performance of Netjets in the US, which “dipped far into the red,” according to the latest letter to shareholders by Mr Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report.“I said last year that this business would earn money in 2005,” said Mr Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman, “but I was dead wrong.”Netjets fell to a pre-tax loss of $80m in 2005 from a pre-tax profit of $10m in 2004.
134;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
135;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-04-25T17:16:59Z;Lockheed prospers on US arms build up;;Lockheed Martin profits rose 60 per cent in the first three months of 2006 as the world’s biggest defence company continued to take advantage of growing US military budgets.Northrop Grumman, its US rival, also beat analyst expectations, though first quarter profits fell 12 per cent to $358m, largely because of damage at its Gulf coast shipyards caused by Hurricane Katrina.The strong performance recently by all the major US contractors - Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon - has pushed defence shares to fresh highs. It has also generated huge cash piles at the companies, raising expectations for further consolidation of the industry.Net income at Lockheed rose to $591m, or $1.34 a share, from $369m, or 83 cents, in the same period last year. The higher figure included a $150m contribution for share disposals in a satellite company and the sale of space imaging assets.Sales rose 8.6 per cent to $9.21bn.Operating profits rose across each of Lockheed’s businesses in the quarter, but most markedly in its electronics division, boosted by the contribution from air defence, training and maritime systems. The company also recently won a $2bn contract from the US air force to develop a secure global communications network.Lockheed, like many of its peers, is also pushing into the lucrative provision of IT services to federal government departments. It won a contract in the first quarter to shift the FBI from a paper-based to an electronic case management system.Profits at Lockheed’s space business also rose sharply, to $193m from $153m. This was because of bigger sales of government satellites, ballistic missile systems and missile defence activities.Growth at the aerospace business was held back by lower sales of F-16 fighter jets and fewer C-130J deliveries. But profits still rose from $222m to $240m because of higher volumes on the F-22 and F-35 programmes.Northrop, which makes B-2 stealth bombers and nuclear submarines, managed to lift operating profit at its information systems, electronics and aerospace divisions. But profits fell sharply in naval ship-building because of Katrina and less work on the DD(X) programme to build a new destroyer for the US navy.L-3 Communications, the defence electronics group, reported quarterly profit of $138.9m, compared with $102.4 million, a year ago.
136;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-04-16T19:00:21Z;John Gapper: Investor votes should count;;It is fair to describe Lucian Bebchuk as a corporate troublemaker. Martin Lipton, the lawyer who invented the poison pill defence to hostile takeovers, goes further: he thinks Professor Bebchuk of Harvard university leads “a small band of academic malcontents” with “pernicious” ideas about how US companies should be run.Prof Bebchuk has emerged from his ivory tower and become an activist at US companies including American International Group, Time Warner and General Dynamics. He wants to limit the use of poison pills and give shareholders more power in electing directors. His biggest sin, in the eyes of Mr Lipton and Mark Gordon of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is how he is going about it.Instead of submitting non-binding resolutions to annual meetings, which directors can ignore if they wish, Prof Bebchuk is trying to amend the companies’ bylaws. Mr Lipton and Mr Gordon are outraged by this cheeky challenge to the “director-centric” tradition of US corporate law – the idea that managers have broader responsibilities than simply doing what shareholders want.The lawyers, and others, would prefer shareholders to stick to the customary way of doing things. If they are unhappy about the way a company is run, they can put public pressure on directors or, in extreme cases, sue, which is how a group of News Corporation investors persuaded Rupert Murdoch to give them a vote on the company’s poison pill.There are some good arguments for keeping shareholders in their place, or at least for stopping them exerting day-to-day control over a company’s affairs. But there is a flaw in the traditionalists’ case: investors should at least have the right to select a company’s directors once in a while, even if the directors are then left to get on with their jobs. It is far harder to exercise this shareholder right in the US than in some other countries, such as the UK.Prof Bebchuk’s ambitions do not stop at amending bylaws. He would also like shareholders to have the power to initiate changes in corporate charters, the constitutional documents akin to articles of association in the UK. He thinks that shareholders ought to be able to make “rules of the game” decisions, such as whether to accept takeover bids, and even to fix the level of share dividends.This is not as revolutionary as it sounds, since UK investors have the right to propose, and vote on, changes to articles of association. Nor do they have to worry about poison pills, since the takeover code limits the power of directors to block takeover bids. But there is little chance of this happening in the US, since directors’ exclusive right to propose charter changes is embedded in law.Leo Strine, the Delaware judge, has written a subtle reply to Mr Bebchuk (www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center). Judge Strine sets out the traditionalist view that directors should be allowed to exercise their judgment without “nitpicking” by investors: “The ingenuity and skill of talented managers is what ultimately produces corporate wealth.”Clearly, companies should not be constantly at the beck and call of shareholders. Part of the directors’ job is to adjudicate among investors: a hedge fund may want cash to be distributed while others prefer it to be reinvested. In practice, in spite of the legal differences, UK investors hardly ever try to arrogate such decisions from directors by diktat.But the balance of power between directors and shareholders depends on the latter trusting the former and having some effective recourse if trust breaks down. This is the case in the UK, where shareholders have the right to nominate directors and to vote others off the board if they wish. Both of these are far more difficult for investors to achieve in the US because of its baroque voting rules.US shareholders have no access to official ballots: directors decide who to nominate and disaffected investors must bear the cost of putting up a rival slate (as Carl Icahn threatened to do for the Time Warner board). The Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2003 proposal for a shareholder access rule was flawed but it did at least recognise the problem.More oddly, the fact that a majority of shareholders votes against a nominated director is not enough to stop him or her being elected. Most companies operate by plurality voting, which means that even a nominee who gets only a few votes is safe. “Ultimately, boards can thumb their noses at investors,” observes Pat McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services, an investor advisory group.The traditionalists who dislike Prof Bebchuk’s attempt to shift the balance of corporate power would be on firmer ground if more democratic safeguards for shareholders were in place. Happily, there some signs of progress on the corporate landscape.Efforts by investors to replace plurality with majority voting – giving shareholders the right to vote down directors – are being mounted at 150 companies during the current season of annual meetings. Judge Strine, meanwhile, floats the idea of giving big investors a right to nominate directors once every three years.Until voting rights for shareholders are reinforced, most board elections at US companies will be little more than a sham. Mr Lipton and Mr Gordon excoriate Prof Bebchuk for wanting companies to be run by “shareholder referenda” but even representative democracy would be a change.
137;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-04-07T19:09:21Z;BAE unlikely to pick big US targets;;The prospect of BAE Systems building a £5bn ($8.7bn) acquisition war chest and parking its tanks on the lawns of big US rivals may have a certain appeal to UK patriots.In reality, the US ambitions of Britain’s biggest defence company are likely to be more mundane.BAE broke into the top tier of Pentagon suppliers last year with the $4.2bn purchase of United Defense Industries, maker of the US army’s Bradley fighting vehicles.The possible £3bn proceeds from the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Airbus to EADS provide the firepower to strike similar sized deals. Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, argues that with its strong balance sheet BAE could have more than £5bn to spend.But BAE executives are cautious, and while US deals are wanted, expensive acquisitions are unlikely – for now at least. “They will probably use the money over time on smaller transactions,” says one person close to the company. “And any transactions will probably be smaller than the UDI deal, though things can change.”BAE bought UDI relatively cheaply but since then the values of US defence companies have soared. Big US rivals – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon – also have cash to spend.BAE has said it is not interested in acquiring L3 Communications, a defence electronics specialist with a $10bn market value, because the “numbers do not add up”. But even smaller US defence groups valued in BAE’s £500m-£2bn target range command racy price to earnings ratios.The company is looking to buy smaller defence electronics specialists, but is also building a presence in the more prosaic area of IT contracting for US government departments, an increasingly lucrative business. In 2004, it paid $600m for DigitalNet, a computer network provider to the Pentagon and other federal agencies, and similar low-key deals are probable.“The US targets are not likely to be names which are clearly on our radar screens, in much the same way as the DigitalNet acquisition,” says Ben Fidler, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.BAE executives insist the Airbus disposal was driven by the timing being right for an exit rather than to provide funds for any specific acquisition.But this could leave them with a large unused cash pile unless they identify targets quickly that will not destroy value. That could stretch investor patience.“It will take a little while to spend the Airbus cash and pressure will grow on BAE management to return money to shareholders if it takes a long time,” says Mr Fidler. “If they did return money, they could always launch a subsequent rights issue if they needed cash at a later stage for an acquisition.”The Airbus stake sale will initially dilute BAE earnings by between 15 and 20 per cent. But the positive reaction of the London market on Friday showed investors were expecting the sale and were comfortable with BAE’s strategy to reuse the funds on its US acquisition strategy. BAE’s shares, which have risen 60 per cent in the past year, rose 4½p to 435½p.The dilution could also put on hold any plans by BAE to sell out of more of its European joint ventures.A statement on Friday from Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, highlighted his strategic goal to “be the premier transatlantic defence and aerospace company with a strong footprint in both the UK and US”. He failed conspicuously to mention Europe, where BAE owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, the missile company, and 20.5 per cent of Saab, the Swedish fighter-jet maker.EADS, which also owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, is keen to buy out BAE and Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group that owns 25 per cent of the missile group.However, an industry source says an MBDA deal is now less likely in the short term because BAE will be reluctant to reduce its group earnings any further after the Airbus sale.And while the Airbus sale allows BAE to exit at a good time from a non-core business, MBDA is more central to BAE’s ongoing strategy. Britain’s Ministry of Defence would also be worried about BAE selling out of the UK missiles business.The acquisition of BAE’s Airbus stake could also hold back further any plans by EADS to bid for Thales, the French defence electronics specialist.EADS had €5.5bn ($6.6bn) of net cash at the end of last year, but much of this will be spent on the Airbus stake. While an EADS/Thales deal would not unduly worry BAE because of its own strategic US focus, the prospect of a much enlarged competitor on its doorstep would present challenges.Thales has a strong relationship with the MoD, and BAE would resist any threat to its domestic dominance.BAE had threatened to pull out of the UK because of its troubled relationship with the MoD, but a recent government white paper heralding BAE as the UK’s contractor of choice in “air, land and sea” has repaired the damage.It is considering a joint bid with VT Group for Babcock International, where it could emerge as the owner of most of Britain’s naval shipyards.Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal group, says BAE’s plans to sell its Airbus stake would be received well in the US.“It removes the negative sentiment about BAE being a tool of European government economic policy.”Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
138;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-04-06T23:31:12Z;BAE builds up its dealmaking firepower;;BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence company, has made no secret of its ambition to expand further in the US and the sale of its Airbus stake to EADS, the Franco-German defence company, will give it more firepower to do deals.The company has in recent years been exiting its European businesses and looking to form an ever-closer relationship with the US defence department, the highest-spending military customer in the world.In its annual results presentation in February, Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive and architect of its US-dominated strategy, said he was keen to buy more US companies following last year’s $4.2bn (£2.4bn) purchase of United Defense Industries, the armoured vehicle maker.The UDI deal was the biggest acquisition in BAE’s history and made it the sixth-largest defence contractor in the US - one level below the big five: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.At the same time, it has sold its UK avionics business to Finmeccanica of Italy and a German naval electronics business to ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial group, and EADS.According to Mr Tuner, BAE had even considered pulling out of its home market in the UK because of its unhappy relationship with the Ministry of Defence.But times have changed and a recent UK government white paper has established BAE as the partner of choice for the MoD across “air, land and sea”.Where the UK was the most open defence market in the world to international competition, it will now do more to protect BAE as its national champion.Mr Turner is glad that the new spirit of rapprochement should guarantee his company margins of about 8 per cent from what remains its biggest customer. But this pales by comparison with the 15 per cent defence companies expect to make in the US.Hence, while BAE is happy with its position on the Eurofighter, with a huge new deal expected with Saudi Arabia, it continues to see its most attractive growth prospects in the US.In a meeting with analysts last week, BAE’s US management team said it did not need to make more big acquisitions to gain scale because the UDI deal had provided it with a perfect political “footprint” with the DoD.Through UDI, BAE makes the Bradley fighting vehicle used by US armed forces and is heavily involved in creating the next generation of fighting vehicles.Some speculation has centred on a possible bid for L3 Communications, a US defence electronics specialist. But it has a $10bn (£6bn) market value and US BAE executives said such a deal would be too expensive and not earnings enhancing.Some experts feel BAE is more likely to make further bolt-on acquisitions in the £1bn-£2bn range, but with the Airbus cash in its pocket maybe its ambitions will grow.
139;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-04-04T12:56:28Z;CSC: History;;Two pioneers, Roy Nutt and Fletcher Jones started Computer Sciences Corporation in 1959 with $100.Nutt had forged a reputation as a star programmer and was a member of the small IBM team that developed the programming language Fortran, while Fletcher Jones’ strength was in marketing.The two spotted an opportunity for a company which could provide computer manufacturers with programmes that would make it easier to use computers.In the 1960s the company launched itself into the space business with a contract supporting NASA, which was the start of a long running association.In 1964 it was listed on the Pacific and American stock exchanges, the first software company to be listed on a national exchange.By the mid-1960s, it had annual revenues of $4m and started a drive to expand into the user market rather than just serving manufacturers. It transformed itself into a supplier of IT services, as well as developing software and was started to develop its business in communications-based computer systems.During the late 1960s it expanded into Canada, Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands and by 1968 was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It had also won a contract from General Electric from the US Atomic Energy Commission, strengthening its presence with government departments.The 1970s saw further expansion and the development of Infonet, a network which allowed people from different sites to run jobs simultaneously on the same computer. By the mid 1970s, Infonet was a serving 125 cities and nearly every US government agency.During the 1980s, CSC went on the acquisition trail acquiring more than 200 large and small companies to strengthen its presence in the US, European and Australian markets. It expanded into new areas such as management consulting, but retained its presence in the US government market.At this time it built Europe’s first automated teller machine system for Générale de Banque and CSC engineers built a flight-testing system for the B-2 stealth bomber.In the early 1990s CSC entered the IT outsourcing market with a $3bn contract from General Dynamics, and throughout the1990s it continued to win contracts with companies such as British Aerospace and DuPont. It also has a contract with the NHS in the UK.CSC now employs about 78,000 people in 80 countries around the world. In 2003 it acquired DynCorp, the US private military company, for $950m.
140;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-02-02T18:19:38Z;Raytheon profits up 13% in busy defence season;;Raytheon, the world’s largest maker of missiles, on Thursday announced better-than-expected profits of $276m for the fourth quarter, closing out an earnings season for the US’s largest defence contractors that saw all five of the Pentagon’s leading arms manufacturers post impressive gains.Raytheon’s fourth quarter profits were up 13 per cent on 2004 levels, and its revenues for the quarter were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn. For the year, Raytheon earned $871m on $21.9bn in sales.Although Raytheon is the smallest of the so-called Big Five Pentagon contractors, it has benefited from the continuing rise in US defence spending along with its bigger competitors, all of whom in the last week reported strong revenue and earnings improvement in 2005.The strong performance has pushed shares in all the major US contractors – Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Raytheon – to at least three-year highs, and has generated huge cash piles for several of the companies, raising expectations for another round of industry consolidation.The industry has also been buoyed by the Pentagon’s decision – expected to be confirmed next week, when it unveils its 2007 budget – not to kill any of the large weapons programmes that were subject to intense cost-cutter scrutiny over recent months as part of the departments’ sweeping quadrennial defence review.Although Raytheon was less vulnerable than the other prime contractors since it makes fewer of the large, high-cost platforms that came under scrutiny, it is a leading subcontractor on several programmes that were thought to be at risk, including the US navy’s new destroyer, called DD(X).Raytheon’s gains came in almost all its business divisions, including its high-profile missile unit, which saw revenues jump 11 per cent to $1.1m in the fourth quarter thanks to the rollout of its latest upgrade for the US navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile. Earnings in the unit climbed 4 per cent to $118m.The company’s defence electronics and sensors division performed the strongest, posting $154m earnings on $1bn in sales. The profits were a 29 per cent increase on a year earlier, an improvement the company said was due to sales overseas and improved performance in domestic programmes.
141;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-01-25T13:38:59Z;Armoured vehicles drive General Dynamics earnings;;General Dynamics, the US defence giant, on Wednesday announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter thanks in part to a strong global demand for armoured vehicles.The company said its fourth quarter earnings from its continuing operations hit $406m, up 23 per cent from the $330m posted in 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $5.8bn, up from $5.2bn from a year earlier.Nicholas Chabraja, General Dynamics chief executive, said the growth came in all four of the company’s business divisions, including its civilian aerospace unit, making of Gulfstream executive jets, which increased revenue by 13 per cent in the fourth quarter.But he said the strongest sales growth came in its combat systems division, the unit which makes armoured vehicles including the US army’s iconic Abrams tank, which posted a 23 per cent sales increase to $1.4bn.General Dynamics also announced a substantial cash position for the quarter and the year, much like other US defence groups, including Northrop Grumman which on Tuesday said it had accumulated a $2.5bn cash pile in 2005. General Dynamics said its free cash flow from operations hit $1.8bn in 2005.The accumulation of cash by large defence groups has led to speculation that another wave of consolidation is in the offing. General Dynamics has already announced a $2.2bn takeover of defence technology group Anteon last month.Despite the strong earnings, General Dynamics gave guidance for 2006 which was slightly below analyst expectations, saying it expected to post earnings per share of between $7.80 and $7.85. For the year, the company said it had posted $21.2bn in revenues, up from $19.1bn a year earlier, and $1.5bn in earnings, up from $1.2bn.Like other US defence companies, General Dynamics is awaiting the 2007 Pentagon budget, expected to be unveiled early next month. Although analysts have raised the expectation that a range of weapons programmes could be killed or scaled back, General Dynamics is not expected to be amongst those hard hit.Because it is the US’s leading maker of armoured vehicles, which have been heavily used in Iraq, the Pentagon budget could help the company’s performance, since it is expected to show continued investment in maintaining and upgrading the army’s land systems.The company’s most vulnerable programme, the US navy’s new destroyer called DD(X), has also been given recent contract awards, leading many to believe the programme will be spared the budget-cutters’ knife.
142;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2006-01-24T14:15:34Z;Northrop reports profit rise despite hurricanes;;Northrop Grumman, the Los Angeles-based defence giant, saw its profits in the fourth quarter rise 22 per cent over 2004, despite having its warship building operations hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in October.While its revenues for the quarter were largely unchanged at just under $7.9bn, its net income rose to $331m from $272m thanks largely to improved performance in its fast-growing integrated systems division, which includes the company’s unmanned spy drones like the Global Hawk and Firescout.The earnings beat analyst estimates, and the company improved its earnings guidance for 2006 from $4.10 to $4.30 per share to $4.25 to $4.40 per share. The fourth quarter results helped Northrop deliver record revenues of $30.7bn for the year, up 3 per cent over 2004.Northrop also announced it had generated $678m in net cash in the quarter, more than double a year earlier, finishing the year with more than $2.5bn in cash from operating activities. The pile joins other strong cash positions from the US’s defence companies, a situation that has led to speculation the industry is poised for another round of consolidation.Already, shipbuilding rival General Dynamics has moved to acquire defence technology group Anteon for $2.2bn, and Lockheed Martin took a stab at buying the defence services business from Computer Sciences late last year.Ronald Sugar, Northrop chief executive, said in a statement that the “outstanding cash generation” would help the company proceed with its already-announced $1.2bn share buy-back. “This year’s strong results were achieved despite the charges associated with Hurricane Katrina,” Mr Sugar said.The industry is braced for the Pentagon to announce its 2007 budget next month, which is expected to see cuts in several large weapons programmes. Already, Northrop has been hurt by a slow-down in the navy’s new destroyer programme, called DD(X), but the Pentagon has said it would not kill the ship, as many analysts expected.Still, the slow-down in the DD(X) programme, coupled with damage to the company’s shipyards in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, saw Northrop’s shipbuilding revenues slip from more than $1.7bn in 2004 to just under $1.5bn last year. The hit was particularly hard in its surface ships division, where sales dropped 56 per cent.Northrop also said it took a $65m pre-tax charge because of problems in the upgrade of the F-16 fighter, built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop, which is responsible for the electronic warfare suite for the newest version of the fighter, being built for the UAE, said costs will be higher to complete the system.Some of those charges were offset by the sale of its remaining stake in wireless communications provider Endwave, which it unloaded for $14m.
143;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-12-14T21:55:38Z;Dow up as market continues to mull Fed;;Wall Street moved one step closer to resuming its stalled year-end rally on Wednesday after both the Dow and the S&P 500 overcame initial sluggishness to extend their gains for a second consecutive day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, helped by solid gains from Boeing and Honeywell, rose by as much 93 points in midsession before easing back to close up 0.6 per cent, or 59.79 points, at 10,883.51.The S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent, or 5.31 points, higher at 1,272.74. However, the Nasdaq Composite index missed out on the rally. The index finished 0.1 per cent, or 2.41 points, lower at 2,262.59, weighed down by a slump in shares of Apple Computer.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach said the rally was a follow-through from the Federal Reserver’s dovish statement on Tuesday.With the Fed signalling that further rate rises would depend on economic data, Mr Cardillo said bulls took heart from news of lower import prices and a record trade deficit – data which was interpreted as signalling that inflationary pressures might be lessening.The bond market certainly saw it that way. Bond yields fell sharply as investors began betting more strongly that the cycle of monetary tightening would end sooner rather than later.Shares in rate-sensitive stocks such as homebuilders jumped, with the Philadelphia Homebuilding index gaining 1.9 per cent.Industrial blue chips were the day’s top performers. Shares in Boeing rose to an all-time high after the aerospace giant beat rival Airbus to win a 115-plane order, valued at up to $18bn, from Qantas Airways, Australia’s biggest carrier.After finishing Tuesday’s session at $70.59 Boeing advanced another 1.2 per cent to $71.45. Its shares have risen 40.6 per cent this year, taking strength from steady plane sales.Fellow Dow component Honeywell International jumped 4.5 per cent to $37.50 after it reiterated its profit outlook for 2005 while raising its sales guidance for fiscal 2006.Technology stocks, however, were under pressure after two brokers downgraded Apple Computer. Shares in the iPod maker slumped 4 per cent to $72.01 after Bear Stearns and Banc of America both cut their ratings, citing valuation concerns.On the deals front, Anteon International surged more than $13, or 32.5 per cent, to $54.02 after defence contractor General Dynamics said that it would buy the information technology provider for $2.2bn, or $55.50 a share. Shares in General Dynamics declined 0.4 per cent to $111.68.Deal talk also swirled in the utilities sector, with FPL Group reportedly in talks to buy Constellation Energy in a deal valued at more than $11bn.FPL inched up 0.3 per cent to $43, while Constellation jumped 8.6 per cent to $61.10.
144;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-12-14T21:06:43Z;Lex: General Dynamics;;The war on terror has claimed many victims. Defence contractors are not among them. That is especially true for the ones that specialise in information technology to help US government agencies make sense of raw data. Hence the interest by traditional defence companies to beef up their presence in the area through acquisitions.General Dynamics’s purchase of Anteon International is only the latest example. At $2.2bn in cash and assumed debt, the price tag should certainly please Anteon’s shareholders, including Caxton-Iseman, the private equity group that took it public. Based on consensus forecasts for next year, that translates into about 1.3 times sales and 13.7 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That is hefty for what is essentially an IT services business, even by the standards of recent deals.Years of acquisitions have left Anteon with an impressive client list, ranging from the Department of Defense to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose emergency management information system it set up. But while its business is well diversified across different agencies, about 90 per cent of it still depends on the US federal government in one way or another. Despite stringent procurement rules, that has been a boon in recent years. The need to replace aging government infrastructure, procurement reform and the growing prominence of homeland security suggest that there should be scope for further growth.The era of the US government splashing out on defense in general, however, is already drawing to a close. Indeed, budgetary pressures on their traditional businesses are one of the main reasons why defense contractors are keen to expand their services arms. Given that backdrop, it would hardly take a sudden outbreak of peace for General Dynamics own rating at 15.5 times earnings to come under pressure.
145;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-12-14T18:54:19Z;General Dynamics to buy Anteon;;Caxton-Iseman Capital, a mid-sized US private equity group, completed an extremely lucrative buy-out when it agreed to sell Anteon International, an information technology services provider, to General Dynamics, the defence contractor, for $2.1bn in cash.After the deal, Caxton-Iseman’s $32.5m investment will have returned more than $700m to the private equity firm, which took Anteon public in 2002 and has since reduced its stake to about 6 per cent.In recent years, much of the attention in the private equity industry has been centred on the big pay-outs to investors from the largest firms, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone and Bain Capital. But below that level, dozens of smaller firms are battling to secure deals such as Caxton-Iseman’s – which has produced a return of more than 20 times the money it invested.In the late 1990s, Caxton-Iseman joined forces with Joe Kampf, Anteon’s chief executive, to take over the company, at the time a small but promising supplier of IT services to the US government.Mr Kampf and Anteon’s senior management, which also invested in the company early and will become managers at General Dynamics, are expected to make “hundreds of millions of dollars” as a result of the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.Since 1996, when Caxton-Iseman took control of Anteon, the company experienced a surge in revenues from about $110m to $1.5bn as it grew organically and pushed through a series of acquisitions. After the initial public offering, Anteon shares rode the wave of soaring valuations in the defence industry, jumping from $18 at the listing to $54.05 in morning trading yesterday, slightly below the $55.50 offered by General Dynamics. The offer represents a 36 per cent premium to Anteon’s closing share price on Thursday.Fred Iseman, Caxton-Iseman president, said he was “very proud” of the investment and Anteon’s “extraordinary growth.The deal will rank as the most lucrative in the history of Caxton-Iseman, which has about $2bn under management and was formed in 1993 when Mr Iseman secured the backing of Bruce Kovner, the New York hedge fund manager that owns Caxton Corporation.
146;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-06-24T09:18:01Z;BAE wins US approval for United Defense deal;;"The Department of Justice on Friday approved BAE Systems’s $4.2bn takeover of American armoured vehicle maker United Defense, clearing the final hurdle in the largest foreign takeover of a US weapons company to date.The approval was widely expected, particularly after the deal received clearance from US national security regulators in April, but finalisation of the acquisition marks a watershed in the US defence industry. For the first time, a foreign company will be a major prime contractor to the Pentagon, manufacturing everything from the army’s Bradley personnel carriers to the Marine Corps amphibious assault vehicles.With the acquisition of United Defense, Britain’s BAE also becomes the second-largest maker of land-based weapons system in the world, behind only Virginia-based General Dynamics, maker of the US army’s Abrams tank and Stryker fighting vehicle.Last year, BAE acquired Alvis, the British tank maker, and Hagglunds, the Swedish land systems group - combined, BAE’s new land systems group will generate an estimated £2bn, making it just smaller than the $4.4bn combat systems division of General Dynamics.Prior to BAE’s aggressive move into tank making, General Dynamics had been gradually buying up European land systems groups, including Mowag of Switzerland, Santa Barbara of Spain, and Steyr Spezialfahrzeug of Austria. Indeed, it was General Dynamics’s attempt to acquire Alvis last year that prompted BAE’s successful counter-bid, setting the stage for the United Defence offer.General Dynamics was also a suitor of United Defense in the past. In 1997, it lost out to the Carlyle Group private equity fund, which took the company private before returning the company to the public markets in 2001.The two companies are now poised to be the prime consolidators of a still-splintered global land systems business; among the largest land systems groups that remain independent are Germany’s Rheinmetall, maker of the Leopard tank, and Giat of France.Following Justice Department approval, BAE is expected to finalise a corporate reorganisation that will see its entire land systems group run out of the US by United Defence’s current chief executive, Tom Rabaut.In addition, the company, based in Farnborough, south of London, will now generate nearly half of its revenues from the US; revenues from the British ministry of defence, which has long been the company’s largest customer, will drop from 30 per cent to 20 per cent, according to BAE officials."
147;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Thales targets BAE’s Atlas Elektronik;;Thales, the French armament group, hopes to buy the German company, Atlas Elektronik from BAE Systems, Financial Times Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper has learnt.Atlas Elektronik, one of the world’s leading suppliers of electronics for submarines and ships, employs 1600 people and has a turnover of 292m Euro.“We will definitely pursue an acquisition if Atlas Elektronik comes on the market and we are invited to make an offer,” Jean-Georges Malcor, managing director of Thales-Marine told FT Deutschland.But it remains unclear whether Thales will be allowed to bid for the company under German law. The German government recently passed a law that vetoes the sale of armament groups to foreign companies. The German government has recently emphasised not only the importance of the French-German relations, but the need to strengthen its own armament industry. The French government has a 31 per cent stake in Thales.ThyssenKrupp, the steel manufacturers and engineering firm, and EADS, the aeronautic defence and space company, are also interested in buying Atlas Elektronik.Mr Malcor believes that the amalgamation of naval companies is inevitable. “The process has already begun. It is no longer a question of if, but a question of when and how,” he said.In Germany, one dockyard has already been built under ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and in France the state owned dockyard, DCN, which will soon be privatised, joined Thales through a joint venture with Armaris. The French company is one of the main promoters of a naval dockyard network, following the example set by EADS.In contrast to Europe, America only has four main naval groups – Europe has twelve large companies. And two of these groups are full-range suppliers. Both General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have their own dockyards.“Customers are starting to ask for total solutions to cater for certain needs that they have,” Mr Malcor said.The industry is on the brink of change. The end of the Cold War has issued in new demands on ships and there has been an increase in the number of electronic parts, according to Mr Malcor. “The ships should have a universal purpose. There is a trend towards a multi-mission-platform,” he added.Thales is well equipped to deal with changes in the market. The naval division has a turnover of 2.04bn Euro and employs almost 7100 workers. And Mr Malcor expects a “possible surge in contracts” from large projects. “There may be contracts worth up to 3bn Euro coming in,” he said.Mr Malcor declined to comment on a possible merger between EADS and Thales, other than to say that different options are being considered. But, at the recent EADS general meeting, Arnaud Lagardere, the co-chairman of the supervisory board, said that a merger between the two groups was a possibility.
148;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-03-31T23:53:34Z;Bush nominates England as Rumsfeld deputy;;"President George W. Bush on Thursday nominated Gordon England, secretary of the Navy, to replace Paul Wolfowitz as deputy defence secretary, according to a government official.The White House was expected on Thursday evening to make an announcement on Mr England, whose appointment must be vetted by the Senate. Mr Wolfowitz was formally approved on Thursday as president of the World Bank. A former executive at General Dynamics, the defence contractor, Mr England has served twice as secretary of the Navy, in addition to holding the number two job at the Department of Homeland Security.He is believed to be trusted by Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary, earning the reputation as his “go-to” man. Most recently Mr England has been responsible for overseeing the combatant status review tribunals that the Pentagon uses to evaluate whether prisoners at Guantánamo Bay still pose a threat to the US.Mr Rumsfeld had previously considered splitting the deputy role into two positions a chief operating officer and a policy position. A senior administration official said that concept had been rejected, but the idea of restructuring the top of the Pentagon was still “in flux”.Whereas Mr Wolfowitz cut a controversial figure on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers questioned his planning for the war in Iraq, Mr England is well respected among lawmakers.Mr Wolfowitz also earned a reputation as a poor manager, although his supporters say Mr Rumsfeld asked him to concentrate on policy and strategy issues, rather than the more traditional management role usually filled by the deputy.The Navy secretary faces many challenges, including running the largest government bureaucracy which is undergoing many changes as Mr Rumsfeld attempts to transform the military from its cold war structure.“It is a super-tough assignment,” said Michael O' Hanlon, military analyst at the Brookings Institution. “He may wind up the only top Pentagon official to serve all of Bush's second term because word on the street is that Rumsfeld is unlikely to last that whole time. So Iraq and other challenges could fall in England's lap even more than one might think.”Mr Rumsfeld recently sent the White House his recommendation for a replacement for Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defence for policy, who has announced his departure from the Pentagon. One of the leading candidates for the number three position is considered to be Eric Edelman, who recently stepped down as US envoy to Turkey.One former senior official said that the appointment of a solid manager such as Mr England could signal that the White House would choose a more policy-orientated leader for the Pentagon when Mr Rumsfeld steps down. One candidate, the official said, could be Scooter Libby, chief of staff to Vice-President Dick Cheney.Richard Armitage, who recently stepped down as deputy secretary of state, is also considered to be a possible candidate to replace Mr Rumsfeld. In recent months, Mr Armitage turned down White House offers to run the Department of Homeland security, the Central Intelligence Agency and to become the National Intelligence Director, according to several sources familiar with his decisions.""Gordon England is the best manager in DoD, bar none,"" said Dov Zakheim, former Pentagon comptroller.""He works well with everyone. The secretary of defence has consistently looked to him to address knotty issues that are nominally outside his sphere as Secretary of the Navy. This is an excellent choice."""
149;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-01-26T14:02:02Z;General Dynamics boosted by jet business;;"General Dynamics, the US aerospace and defence group, on Wednesday said fourth-quarter earnings rose sharply boosted by sales of military equipment used in Iraq as well as from its Gulfstream jet business.The group said earnings during the quarter rose from $279m, or $1.40 a share, to $336m, or $1.66 a share, in the same period last time. Sales were up nearly 10 per cent at $5.19bn. The figures were higher than some analyst expectations.The group has benefited from increased uptake in demand for its military equipment from the US government but has also seen strong gains over the past year in its aerospace division, notably in its Gulfstream business jets unit.On Wednesday it confirmed that demand remained strong, as it revealed a strong order book.Funded backlog, a key measure of unfilled orders, rose to $28.3bn in 2004 and total backlog was $42.1bn compared to $25.1bn and $39.9bn respectively in 2003.Nicholas D. Chabraja, chief executive, said: ?In the Aerospace group, Gulfstream had tremendous order activity in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $586m increase to its funded backlog. Several key programme wins in Information Systems and Technology resulted in an increase of nearly $1bn in its funded backlog; and Combat Systems? funded backlog increased by approximately $200m, not including the impact of a 260-vehicle order from Portugal that remains to be finalised with our European Land Combat Systems group.?He said the group was also set to benefit from recent contract awards, among them was a $586m deal for two T-AKE combat logistic ships received by Nassco, a commercial shipbuilding programme, and a $562m award for the second of two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.Mr Chabraja said: ?In three out of four of our major business groups, earnings and operating margins increased dramatically over the year-ago period, and the growth of funded backlog in all four groups bodes well for our future.?General Dynamics said on Wednesday that it expected a ?continued solid performance? from Combat Systems and Information systems and technology, margin improvement in marine systems and ?continued improvement in Gulfstream?. It is expecting 2005 earnings per share to rise between 11 and 13 per cent.Separately, Rockwell Collins, the US maker of military and commercial communications equipment, said profit for three months to the end of December rose 32 per cent, on the back of strong sales of its commercial and government systems."
150;GD;General Dynamics Corp;2005-01-14T17:28:38Z;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson: Profiting from a waiting game;;There is an old saying: “A profit is not a profit until you take it.”Last year my self-invested personal pension scheme (Sipp) greatly increased its cash pile as I took profits on some of my investments.Three of my largest cash “winners” demonstrated the virtues of patience. Generally, I prefer to buy shares in companies which I hope will out-perform over the longer term rather than trying to make quick “in and out” deals and rapidly churning the portfolio's holdings in the hope of making a profit.I first bought shares in armoured and military vehicles specialist Alvis in December 1993 for 40p each. I was attracted by its strong assets. At the time, Alvis had a market capitalisation, based on its ordinary shares, of £22m. But it had a large stake in technical equipment maker Avimo Singapore which was worth more than £40m.Over the years, Alvis reduced its Avimo stake and built up its own business. In March last year US defence company General Dynamics made a take-over bid of 280p per share for Alvis. This was soon followed by a “knock-out” bid of 320p per share from BAe Systems, so my Sipp accepted the BAe offer.In 1998 my SIPP bought shares for 190p each in Falkland Islands Holdings (FIH). Soon after purchase, the share price fell and, by February 1999, the price was only 58p but I held on. The company had retailing, shipping, port services and other activities in the Falklands which I thought might be useful if any oil companies started exploring the Falklands.In December 1999 FIH shares jumped to 157p on the news that Leonard Licht, a well-known fund manager, had acquired a large stake in FIH and had joined the board.In early June last year FIH's share price was 270p, but it climbed rapidly following FIH's June 23 announcement of the formation of a new oil exploration company, Falkland Oil Gas Limited (FOGL) “set up together with Global Petroleum and funds managed by RAB Capital.”When FIH shares reached 537p on August 26 I sold sufficient of my holding to recoup my entire outlay, so my remaining shares have in effect cost nothing.In October 2001 my Sipp bought shares for 148p each in pharmaceuticals firm Acambis. By the end of that year the shares had climbed to 350.5p as investors recognised the importance of the company's contracts with the US government for the supply of smallpox vaccines.When investor sentiment proved fickle and the share price fell, I greatly increased my holding in July 2002 for 187p per share. By Easter 2004 the shares had recovered to 364p. On April 13 the company said that, as a “precautionary measure” it had “suspended the recruitment of additional volunteers into its Phase 3 clinical trials involving smallpox vaccine ACAM 2000 and Dryvax, the comparator smallpox vaccine being used in the trials.”While I believed these problems might be overcome and had high hopes for the company's research and development projects such as vaccines for dengue fever and West Nile virus I decided to “play safe” as the share price had fallen sharply so sold the shares for 325p each.I used some of the proceeds from these sales to invest in oil minnows Westmount Energy and Falkland Oil Gas and in pharmaceuticals firms Provalis and Oxford Biomedica. However, much of the cash remains on deposit as I am concerned about the increasing influence of hedge funds and the use of derivative instruments which might, one day, end in disaster for the stock market.Kevin Goldstein-Jackson is an active private investor. He may have a financial interest in any of the companies and strategies mentioned.
