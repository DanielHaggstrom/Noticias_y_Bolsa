0;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Worldpay $43bn deal piles pressure on rivals for more tie-ups;Analysts and investors say competition from new digital entrants is driving mergers;When Worldpay was carved out of Royal Bank of Scotland in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it was a small part of a minor unit with out-of-date technology that was largely ignored by its sprawling parent bank.Less than a decade later, the same business is being bought in the biggest financial services takeover since the recession, in a deal worth $43bn — equal to all of RBS’s current market value.The shift, fuelled by a boom in ecommerce and digital payments, marks one of the biggest structural changes in financial services since the crisis, and is now driving a record-breaking run of merger and acquisition activity as companies scramble to take advantage.Worldpay is being bought by Florida-based financial tech specialist Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) barely a year after Vantiv bought it — and took its name — in a £9.3bn deal that closed last January.FIS provides a range of technologies that help banks and other financial institutions. In payments, FIS software processes transaction requests from payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, establishing that funds are available in a valid account, within credit limits and so on.Worldpay operates at the opposite end of the payment chain, helping to connect both online and brick and mortar retailers to those payment networks.Worldpay was only a third of the way into its integration plan, but FIS chairman Gary Norcross said there was no time to wait: “This is such a fast-moving industry you have to grab the growth and move toward where the growth is when you have the time.”Monday’s deal, two months after rivals Fiserv and First Data agreed their own $39bn combination, means 2019 has already become the third successive year to see a record amount of payments dealmaking. Since the start of the year, 30 deals worth a total of $85bn have been announced, compared with $49bn in all of 2018, according to Dealogic data.Analysts and industry experts said they expected the trend to continue, with the latest acquisition putting further pressure on rivals to avoid being left behind or displaced by new entrants.I would not be surprised if we saw another deal in merchant payments technology before long“As predicted, 2019 is turning out to be the year for consolidation in the fintech industry and, in particular, the payments sector,” said Stuart Bedford, a partner at law firm Linklaters.The payments industry was once dominated by traditional banks, but many of them have sold out and since then it has gone from a sleepy backwater of finance to one of its most exciting sources of growth, fuelling a race to become the global leader.A fast-growing crop of upstart financial technology or “fintech” companies — from PayPal in the US to Alipay in China — are lining up to challenge the incumbents, squeezing margins by offering faster, cheaper and easier-to-use payments.Gareth Wilson, global payments lead at Accenture, said: “Consolidation in the market looks set to continue in order for payment companies to grow globally at scale and compete with the competitive threat of new entrants to the industry.”Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research said: “I would not be surprised if we saw another deal in merchant payments technology before long.” Publicly-traded payment companies that could be candidates for a deal include TSYS, Global Payments, Jack Henry, and Netherlands-based Adyen.Speaking to analysts on Monday, Mr Norcross and Worldpay chief executive Charles Drucker were both keen to stress that theirs was not a defensive merger. “This is all about an offensive deal and going to where the growth is happening and looking in the long term”, Mr Drucker said.For FIS, which provides a wide range of services ranging from core banking platforms to asset management software, the deal provides a way to bulk up its relatively small business providing payment services to retailers and ecommerce companies. For Worldpay, FIS’s stronger presence in fast-growing markets like Brazil and India provides an opportunity to speed up its international expansion.The combined company expects to have annual revenue growth of around 6 per cent when the deal is completed and up to 9 per cent in three years, compared to double-digit growth in less developed markets. It expects $500m of annual revenue synergies by the end of the third year, with a further $400m in annual cost savings.The plans echo earlier deals that have entailed once-specialised companies combining to become “one-stop shops” that can provide more of their customers’ payment needs. E-commerce expert PayPal, for example, paid $2.2bn for Swedish group iZettle, which focuses on in-store services. The earlier Vantiv and Worldpay combination, meanwhile, brought together a US-focused business with a dominant rival in Europe.But the relatively small premium being paid by FIS — about 13 per cent compared to Worldpay’s close last week — also reflects the slower growth prospects in both companies’ core markets, and the need for established companies to cut costs.This pressure will only add to the impetus for consolidation. One investor said newly-listed companies could also be part of the dealmaking spree. On Monday, Italy’s Nexi announced plans to be one of Europe’s largest initial public offerings of the year, while UAE-based Network International is preparing to list in London.A person close to Nexi said: “If you ask me is Nexi going to be only Italian in five or 10 years’ time, I don’t believe so — consolidation is happening and Nexi will be part of it.”
1;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-04-02T07:31:19Z;CVC and ValueAct quit bidding for Misys;;CVC Capital Partners and ValueAct Capital have pulled out of the race to buy Misys, leaving Vista Equity Partners in pole position to take over the banking software specialist.The two private equity groups on Monday declined to submit a counter offer to the £1.27bn cash bid tabled by Vista, which has been recommended by Misys management.The withdrawal of US activist investor ValueAct, Misys’ biggest shareholder with 21.5 per cent, and CVC is likely to conclude the drawn-out battle to snap up the perennial takeover target.Although unlikely, the ValueAct/CVC team could still return to the table should Vista’s bid collapse or a third-party approach for Misys emerge.In a note entitled “I have the fat lady on line two”, George O’Connor at Panmure Gordon said the Vista offer for Misys was almost certain to go ahead.“Bulls might well talk up the (outside) chance of some trade buyer creeping out of the woodwork – but we do not see it. As we have said previously this is a good price for Misys,” he said.Texas-based Vista last month agreed to pay 350p a share – a 6 per cent premium to Misys’s closing share price of 329½p the day before the approach – and is looking to combine the group with Kondor, the former Thomson Reuters technology business that it bought recently.Threadneedle and Schroders, two of Misys’s three largest shareholders with 25 per cent of the stock between them, support the Vista takeover, which is likely to result in a fundamental shake-up of the company.In February, Misys agreed headline terms with Swiss rival Temenos in a $2bn merger that would have created the world’s largest provider of banking software.Shareholders were unimpressed with the all-share deal, however, and the merger fell through after Temenos refused to add a cash element to sweeten its bid. On Monday Temenos declined to comment on the ValueAct/CVC withdrawal.All the recent approaches have been substantially less than the 400p offered in 2011 by Fidelity National Information Services, a US rival, before talks collapsed.Potential suitors may have been put off by a 12 per cent fall in Misys’ sales in the three months to the end of February, as the eurozone crisis weakened banks’ willingness to invest in software.But Misys attributed the slip to customers delaying but not cancelling orders pending the outcome of the takeover battle.Furthermore, Misys is without a permanent chief executive after Mike Lawrie left to head up Computer Sciences Corporation, the troubled IT services company.Misys shares had fallen 2.5 per cent to 349p by the close.

Will another suitor appear?;With all the dedicated effort of a Jane Austen heroine, banking software group Misys has finally found itself a marriage partner. After many months of would-be, could-be suitors, the UK company is saying yes to a 350p a share cash offer from private equity firm Vista. This puts a £1.2bn pricetag on Misys, but is well shy of the 400p-a-share talked about when Fidelity National Information Services was in the hunt last year.Even so, it does not look unreasonable. As Misys points out, its average closing price in the three months to early-February – when the latest bout of marriage proposals erupted – was 265p. The exit multiple is 19 times 2012 consensus estimates (to end May). And the ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is just under 12, so at the top end for recent deals in the sector. Two key institutional shareholders are willing to accept. The big question, then, is whether a rival suitor will intervene.The jump in Misys shares to 356p suggests that, while the market is not ruling this out, it does not think it likely. That looks sensible. Vista has the advantage of being able combine Misys with Turaz, the former Thomson Reuters trade and risk management business it acquired recently. With that in mind, ValueAct Capital Partners, holding one-fifth of Misys, seems more likely to cash out than attempt a rival offer. Industry rival, Geneva-based Temenos, which terminated talks with Misys last week, could re-enter the fray. Estimates have put synergies from that combination as high as $80m-$100m. But these savings would not come quickly or assuredly, and some Misys investors would plainly prefer a cash deal. So the Swiss firm would be stretched.The sooner marriage bells ring, the better: Misys customers are delaying purchases – and who wants a bride with faded looks.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
3;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Vista plans Misys revamp after £1.27bn bid;;Vista Equity Partners has agreed a £1.27bn cash bid for Misys, an agreement likely to see the ageing British software company radically revamped if it goes through.The bid has been recommended by a battle-wearied Misys management, which revealed on Monday that the company’s sales had stalled since bid talks began in February.“The uncertainty is very real for our customers, who want to know who will own a business before they commit to spending millions on a very critical banking system,” said Tom Kilroy, acting chief executive of Misys. “This announcement removes that uncertainty.”Texas-based Vista has agreed to pay 350p a share – a 6 per cent premium to Misys’s closing share price of 329½p on Friday.It is less than the 400p discussed last summer when Fidelity National Information Services, a US rival, was looking at a takeover of the company.However, with the eurozone crisis weakening banks’ willingness to invest in software, Misys’s prospects are less rosy than nine months ago.“The world has changed since last year,” Mr Kilroy said. “This is a good deal.”At 350p a share the company is £200m to £300m more valuable than in 2006, when big shareholders such as ValueAct bought stakes, installing a new management team to turn round what was then seen as a struggling business.Investors already realised about $1.2bn in cash from the sale of Misys’s healthcare business in 2010.Threadneedle and Schroders, two of the company’s three largest shareholders – holding about 25 per cent of the stock between them – are supporting the bid.Misys sales fell 12 per cent in the three months to the end of February as banks delayed purchases of software because of concerns about financial markets and the takeover battle for the company, writes Maija Palmer.Revenues had been just £89m, compared with £100m a year ago.Tom Kilroy, acting chief executive, said customers were delaying but not cancelling orders pending the outcome of bids for the banking software company.Misys withdrew its medium-term profit forecast for annual revenue growth of 5-8 per cent and adjusted operating margins of 20-23 per cent, citing uncertainty in the market to rely on this estimate.ValueAct, the biggest shareholder with 21.5 per cent, has teamed up with CVC for a possible alternative joint cash offer.ValueAct and CVC said they continued to consider their options but warned there was no certainty they would make an offer. They have until April 2 to do so.Misys shares rose nearly 8 per cent to 355.6p, ahead of the bid price, indicating that some investors are hoping for a higher offer from ValueAct and CVC.If Vista is successful, Misys employees can expect a fundamental shake-up of the company. Vista specialises in buying ageing, underperforming enterprise software companies and putting them through something akin to a bootcamp.Vista has staff coaches who retrain employees and a stable of managers to introduce more efficient software-writing methods.The company has migrated several businesses it has bought on to internet-based software-as-a-service systems that are more efficient to bring them into line with what new business customers want.It also has a record of knitting together many smaller software companies in the market to create one stronger company.It did this with software for the utility industry, buying two listed companies in the sector, Indus and MDSI, revamping them and then selling the combined company, Ventyx, to ABB for $1bn in 2010.Vista plans to combine Misys with Turaz, the former Thomson Reuters Kondor business that provides software for managing treasury and capital markets (TCM) transactions. Together, Misys and Turaz will have about 50 per cent of the market for TCM software. Though not well known in the UK, Vista has some history in the country, having bought Sage’s healthcare business, now renamed Vitera, for $320m last year.The company, founded in 2000 by Robert Smith, a former Goldman Sachs banker, also bought Sunquest, a provider of laboratory software, from Misys for $381m in 2007.Vista had looked at a potential acquisition of Misys itself back in 2006, following a failed management buyout by former chief executive Kevin Lomax. But the private equity business was smaller then and had its hands full with the $3.1bn acquisition of Reynolds and Reynolds, a supplier of software to the automotive industry.Vista, which has about $3.3bn left in its current fund, is raising debt from banks including Bank of America, Jefferies and Credit Suisse to help finance the deal, which will be facilitated through Magic Bidco Group, an investment vehicle owned by Vista.
4;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-03-08T17:43:42Z;Shareholder’s move could lead to Misys sale;;Misys has been engaged many times, but has never quite made it to the altar, despite being up for sale over the past six years.But now, with three potential suitors circling the banking software business, it looks as though ValueAct Capital Partners, the activist fund that is Misys’ biggest shareholder, may have engineered a situation to finally get the business sold.A merger with Temenos would see the Swiss rival’s better software sold into Misys’ big customer base of banks and create about $100m in annual savings for the combined group. However, this nil-premium deal does not appeal to shareholders, who would prefer cash.Vista Equity Partners, the US software-focused private equity company, is mulling a cash bid for Misys, believed to be about 360p a share, or £1.2bn. Vista could combine Misys with the Kondor treasury and capital markets business it bought recently to create some synergies. However, Vista only has about $2.2bn left in its fund and has typically not done deals this big, so investors are wondering how serious it is.Analysts argue this is why ValueAct itself this week made the switch from seller to buyer, teaming up with CVC, the US private equity fund, for a potential takeover offer – the price for which has not been disclosed.Given that ValueAct has been trying to sell its holding up to now, and CVC owns no companies with obvious synergies with Misys, many analysts see this third approach merely as a way to create competitive tension and ensure that Vista makes a reasonably priced offer. There is speculation that CVC and ValueAct might bid about 325p a share, representing not so much a knockout offer, as setting a floor for any offer Vista might make.“I am struggling to understand all the games theory and brinkmanship that are going on,” says Julian Yates, analyst at Investec. “ValueAct have been very canny investors up to now but appear to have ended up in a much more uncertain end-game scenario than we would have expected.”Misys investors are unlikely to get the 400p-a-share price that was discussed last summer when the company was in takeover talks with Fidelity National Information Services of the US, but, says Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, a bid of about 370p or 380p a share “would not be silly money”.Given that Mike Lawrie, Misys’ highly regarded chief executive leaves this month for a new job at Computer Sciences Corporation, Misys is under pressure to secure a deal. Without a deal and a chief executive the stock is likely to retreat back to the 240p level they fell to after the Fidelity talks ended last summer.Founded in 1978, Misys has had a long and bumpy ride on the UK tech market. The company sells software that banks – mainly smaller institutions – use to run everything from printing bank account statements to trading currencies. Its heyday was in the late 1990s when, fuelled by fears of the Y2K virus, banks spent lavishly on upgrading their software. The resulting boom in earnings lifted Misys – albeit briefly – into the FTSE 100 list of largest companies.However, growth has been slower since then. Misys struggled to upgrade its banking software and delivered a spate of poor results. Kevin Lomax, Misys’ founder, made an abortive attempt to take the company private in 2006, before ValueAct and Mr Lawrie stepped in to attempt a turnround of what was seen as a basket-case business.One way or another, private equity companies have been running their slide rules over Misys for the past six years, but no one has quite been able to make the numbers work for the kind of price that ValueAct has been hoping for.Temenos could look at a way of sweetening its deal with Misys with some cash. Temenos may also settle for buying just the core banking system from Misys, if it cannot get the whole business. This is where the key synergies are between the two companies, and, valued at about $550m to $600m it would be affordable for the Swiss company.
5;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-02-20T18:09:35Z;Vista makes rival £1.2bn bid for Misys;;A US private equity group has made a rival £1.2bn offer for Misys, the banking software company which this month agreed a merger deal with Switzerland’s Temenos.Vista Equity Partners is putting forward an indicative offer of about 360p for every Misys share, a 16 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price of 309.6p, people close to the deal said on Monday.The offer, which was first reported on FT.com, is considerably lower than the £1.4bn offer Misys is thought to have received from Fidelity National Information Services, the US banking technology company, last summer.However, some Misys shareholders may find it preferable to the proposed combination with Temenos, as the synergies from that deal have been unclear, and it could take shareholders a long time to see a return.Value Act, Misys’s largest shareholder, has declared its support for the Temenos deal but other shareholders are still considering their options.Misys provides banking software systems to around 1,200 financial services companies, providing them with the technology that helps them run everything from current accounts to capital markets trading.Vista recently completed the purchase of Kondor, Thomson Reuters’ trading and risk management business, which could be combined with Misys to create synergies. A combined Misys-Kondor would control around half the global market for treasury and capital markets software, and Misys itself was one of the companies considering buying the Kondor business when it went on sale last summer.Vista will be under pressure to find a new management team for Misys, however, as Mike Lawrie, the chief executive, has already announced plans to take on a new role at Computer Sciences Corporation. Under the Temenos deal, the key management roles would have been filled by Guy DuBois, chief executive of Temenos, and Andreas Andreades, the Swiss company’s chairman.Analysts said that Temenos may try to improve its deal by offering Misys shareholders cash, and that a final price for the UK software company could be around 400p per share, the same price Fidelity was offering last year.“Around 400p feels like the right price for Misys. It resonates with the Fidelity bid last summer and represents a sensible valuation of the different parts of the business,” said Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies.Other private equity groups are also considering a bid for Misys.The UK-based software maker confirmed the approach from Vista, saying it had received an approach “consisting of a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire the entire outstanding share capital of Misys for cash that may or may not lead to an offer being made.”Vista must make a firm offer by the end of trading on March 19. Shares in Misys closed up 6.6 per cent at 330.1p.
6;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-02-10T20:00:13Z;Good reasons for caution on all-share deals;Tie-ups with echoes of dotcom exuberance;A software maker, its stock pumped higher for months by takeover rumours, uses the puffed-up shares as currency to buy its closest rival. This is the kind of deal that helped inflate the dotcom bubble. Investors, therefore, may not welcome its return.This week Misys and Temenos set out terms of a £2bn friendly merger to create the world’s largest maker of banking software. It was, on paper at least, Misys buying Temenos: the former’s shareholders would take 53.9 per cent of the enlarged company. The ownership split was decided after Misys shares surged nearly 50 per cent since mid-November, largely on hopes of a different predator emerging.Though the takeover terms may have favoured Misys, the change of control went in the other direction. Temenos directors take both of the top jobs in the corporate boardroom, which will remain in Switzerland.It was not the deal investors had been expecting. Both Temenos and Misys have fallen by about 13 per cent since news of their merger leaked last week.So are investors right to be so disappointed?There may be some ruefulness among Misys shareholders, given that its management last year spurned an approach from its US peer Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) as undervaluing the company. At the time, Misys shares were trading 45 per cent higher than where they stood on Friday.But FIS has so far shown no inclination to return, and no alternative offers have emerged in the year or so that Misys has been in play. At the moment, a nil-premium merger is the only deal on the table.It is pointless, the bankers say, to concentrate on nebulous takeover premiums when the argument should be about value creation. No one is being asked to sell out, they argue. The only thing that should matter to investors is their slice of future earnings from what should be a bigger, stronger company.The same argument has been happening elsewhere in the City. Xstrata management has been trying to convince its shareholders to accept an all-stock takeover offer from Glencore. They have faced protests that the offer provided a takeover premium of just 8 per cent to the undisturbed price of Xstrata, rather than the 30 per cent premiums that are the norm in the mining sector.Under the current terms, Xstrata shareholders would receive a 45 per cent stake in the combined entity – too small, some say, given it is Xstrata providing the higher asset quality, balance sheet strength and long-term growth. Most analysts believe Glencore will have to sweeten its offer, if only slightly, to win their approval.We may be seeing such arguments more often. Misys and Glencore have their own unique problems, but their choice of all-share deals hints at a broader uncertainty that has choked dealmaking. With elevated volatility resulting in mergers and acquisitions falling to their lowest levels in nearly a decade, equity funding can be seen as lower risk.“A stock transaction takes the debate about whether or not shares are the right price out of the game,” says a broker. “If one stock is overvalued, the other probably is as well.“When paying with cash, you have to make an absolute call on the value of the company you are buying. To an extent, an all-share deal removes the market risk.”Moreover, an all-share deal gives the market some leeway to decide the right price for itself. “If an acquirer is seen to be overpaying and offers stock, investors will sell until they aren’t overpaying any more,” the broker says.The same arguments were applied to the dotcom bubble. Valuations may have been unjustifiably high but, when equally inflated equity provided the currency to a deal, the risk of overpaying mattered less.These were the excuses used for mistakes such as Yahoo paying $5.7bn for Broadcast.com, and Excite’s $6.7bn merger with @Home. It all appeared to be a zero-sum game. Yet, once the bubble had popped, the shareholders still suffered.The irrational exuberance of the late-90s may have been replaced by a gloomier kind of uncertainty, but investors still have reason to be wary of the argument that a valuation becomes arbitrary when expressed in stock.bryce.elder@ft.com
7;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
8;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-02-07T21:14:59Z;Misys and Temenos agree key merger terms;;Misys and Temenos have reached agreement on the key terms of a proposed £2bn merger that would create the world’s largest supplier of risk-management computer software to banks.The planned merger, one of the biggest between European technology companies, would see Misys shareholders take 53.9 per cent of the combined group and Temenos shareholders 46.1 per cent.The combined group would have about 1,000 banks as customers, making it about four times larger than its closest competitors, the financial services arms of Infosys, TCS and Oracle.Guy Dubois, currently chief executive of Temenos, would hold the same role at the combined group, while Stephen Wilson, the chief financial officer of Misys, would become CFO of the merged company.The combined company would have its headquarters in Switzerland but be listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a potential secondary listing in Switzerland.Andreas Andreades, chairman of Temenos, would become chairman of the combined group. Misys would choose five out of nine board members while Temenos would pick four.Mike Lawrie, chief executive of Misys, will leave the company. His departure was widely expected, given that, during the five years Mr Lawrie has been working to turn around the Misys business, he had never made the UK his permanent home during that time.Value Act, the largest shareholder in Misys, has sad it is strongly supportive of the proposed merger.Misys is closely held by a small group of shareholders, including Schroders Investment Management, Threadneedle and Fidelity. Standard Life is one of the ten largest shareholders in both companies.With no period of exclusivity, some industry analysts still expect a counterbid to emerge for Misys, possibly from Fidelity National Information Services, which had failed takeover talks with the company last summer.Analysts said it remained to be seen whether Temenos shareholders would want to swap their stock for shares in the combined group, given that Misys shares have gained nearly a third in value over the past month on the back of bid rumours.Misys shares fell 2.6 per cent to 326.10p ahead of the announcement by the companies after the close of trading in London. It was valued at £1.12bn at the closing price. Shares in Temenos rose 0.56 per cent to SFr19.25, giving it a market capitalisation of SFr1.38bn.Misys and Temenos are expecting costs savings from combining their back office and research and development functions, although people close to the company said that the two companies’ flagship core banking software systems – BankFusion and T24 – will both be maintained.The companies are under pressure to agree a deal quickly, not just to prevent the emergence of a rival offer, but because of concerns that customers will delay orders while there is uncertainty over the future of the two companies.Temenos has rapidly grown its share of the market for core banking software during the last few years, but experienced a sharp drop in spending last year as banks pulled back on new projects. Misys has had slower growth in the past few years but has withstood the downturn better thanks to repeat revenues from a long-established customer base.
9;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-02-03T20:02:13Z;Misys / Temenos: playtime;Investors should hope for bidding battle for banking software groups;"Once in play, always in play. Misys shares lurch from one bout of bid speculation to the next. When the UK banking software group failed to secure an all-cash takeover by Fidelity National Information Services last year, they tumbled. Yet they are up 38 per cent since the beginning of the year – and not just for fun. Misys said on Friday that it was in preliminary merger talks with Geneva-based Temenos, its biggest rival. A deal – the combined companies have a market capitalisation of about $2.8bn – would be unlikely to create much value. Investors should hope for a bidding battle.Mike Lawrie, chief executive, has always looked as if he was turning around Misys to sell it (he used to work at ValueAct Capital Partners, the activist investor that owns a fifth of the software group). His turnround is working well enough – the 2010 purchase of Sophis, a risk-management software specialist, gave Misys greater heft. But FNIS walked away because the US group was loath to overpay in a downturn – banks have been slow to commit to software projects.Investors pushed up Temenos’s share price by 20 per cent on Friday; Misys was flat. That suggests that the premium is already in the latter’s share price (it is the larger of the two companies). There is some overlap between the two, giving scope for cost synergies. But with Temenos strongest in wealth management and Misys in capital markets, synergies may be limited.The more enticing aspect of the talks is that they could flush out an interloper. FNIS offered cash for Misys, valuing it at about a third more than Friday’s £1bn. The US group could return to the fray, while India’s Infosys and Tata have been mentioned in dispatches. An all-share merger with struggling Temenos is hardly the exit Mr Lawrie should want. Let the play begin.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
10;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-02-03T11:51:25Z;Misys holds $2bn merger talks with Temenos;;Misys and Temenos, its Swiss rival, are in talks about a possible $2bn merger that would create the world’s largest supplier of risk-management software to banks.The UK group on Friday confirmed it was in preliminary discussions with Temenos about an all-share deal following constant market speculation over its future in recent months, which has pushed its share price up by nearly half.People close to the deal said Temenos was likely to take just 45 per cent of the combined company but that Guy Dubois, Temenos chief executive, would become its CEO. Misys would appoint the chairman. The companies said there had been no agreement on terms.A combined Misys/Temenos would have about 1,000 banks as customers, making it about four times larger than its closest competitors, the financial services arms of Infosys, TCS and Oracle.But both companies, which have had a sometimes fractious relationship, have been hit by the squeeze on European banks’ spending amid pressures on profitability and delays to long-term IT investments.At the same time, the financial industry is facing sweeping regulation on both sides of the Atlantic, which will require banks to maintain larger capital reserves, alongside greater transparency and tighter margin requirements for trading. Many banks admit they will need real-time monitoring of capital to meet the new rules, potentially benefiting companies such as Misys and Temenos, which can provide appropriate software.Takeover talks between Misys and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) collapsed last summer, but analysts said the Temenos talks could flush out a counterbid from competitors such as Infosys or TCS.“There is more of a chance of them getting involved than when there were talks with FIS and Misys,” said Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies. “A combined Temenos/Misys is much more dangerous a competitor to them.”Others suggested that Misys had been, in effect, up for sale for six months but had attracted no bids. “Management would be unlikely to entertain talks with arch-rival Temenos unless they felt that other avenues were exhausted,” said David Toms, an analyst at Numis Securities.Both companies have had internal reorganisations in recent months. Mr Dubois became chief executive of Temenos last July just before a profit warning. Misys has been digesting the 2010 acquisition of Irish rival Sophis for £235m but is coming towards the end of a five-year turnround plan under Mike Lawrie, its chief executive. He has been backed by ValueAct, a US private equity firm which is both a 22 per cent shareholder and his former employer.Misys closed up 4p at 329.5p, giving it a market capitalisation of £1.1bn. Temenos rose SFr2.7 to SFr19.9, giving it a market capitalisation of SFr1.3bn. Temenos is being advised by Lazard and Misys by Barclays Capital.
11;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2012-01-26T10:55:51Z;Misys hit by cuts in banks’ spending;;Shares in Misys fell after the software company said banks and financial institutions had slowed spending on IT and announced it would have to make cost savings to keep its final results on track.Misys, which last year was the subject of a failed takeover approach, on Thursday reported adjusted operating profit of £30m for the six months to the end of November, down 9 per cent from the previous year, and slightly below market forecasts. The company blamed “challenging market conditions” and procrastination by customers for the decline.“Our customers took longer over their purchase decisions as financial market conditions deteriorated,” said Mike Lawrie, Misys chief executive. “Banks aren’t stopping, this isn’t 2008 all over again, but there is caution out there.”Misys’s products are used by banks and other financial services groups, and its core banking unit has a 1,200-strong customer base that includes all of the world’s 50 largest banks. Mr Lawrie also said he was looking for new acquisitions to help boost sales at the company’s treasury and capital markets division.He also said the company was cutting back on some of its planned marketing and general administration spending in response to the delays, reducing annual operating costs by £6m-£8m.Shares in Misys fell 20.2p to close at 305.3p.However, Mr Lawrie said that the company was starting to see strong interest in new products, such as its new BankFusion software, which has so far been installed in just 11 banks but which has a growing pipeline of orders. Mr Lawrie still expects 250 banks to be using BankFusion by 2015.For the six months to November 30, Misys swung to a pre-tax loss of £3.6m from a profit of £18.8m in the same period last year, mainly due to the amortisation of goodwill from its £235m acquisition of Sophis in 2010.Turnover rose from £160.1m to £196.9m, the diluted loss per share was 0.8p compare with earnings of 117.1p last time and there was no dividend.FT CommentA 6 per cent fall in share price does not signal a disaster in the technology sector. Tech shares can lose 10 per cent of their value in a blink of an eye and 20 to 30 per cent on truly bad news. Misys was only mildly disappointing. The shares have risen more than 30 per cent over the last month on hopes that the company will once again become a takeover target, putting it at slight premium to European software sector peers, which trade at about 15 times forward earnings. Those gains have now been pared back slightly. Medium-term, however, analysts see potential upside in the shares, if the new BankFusion software takes off with customers. Some are also keeping their fingers crossed that Fidelity National Information Services, the US payment processing group, which was in talks to buy Misys last summer for £1.4bn, could rekindle discussions. It would be free to do so from next month.
12;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UK tech companies: takeover targets;There will be more technology sector takeovers. The question is, which ones?;Right, who’s next? Hewlett-Packard’s $11bn swoop on Autonomy has investors looking for the next UK technology company that might lose its, uh, autonomy. Happily, the deal did not generate the angst that surrounded Cadbury/Kraft – and for good reason: there is no more global industry than technology. The scope for another HP/Autonomy is limited by the relatively small scale of the UK tech sector. But the Cambridge Cluster, for example, has 1,400 companies employing 40,000 people, according to the Institute for Manufacturing.So there will be more UK technology sector takeovers. The question for investors is, which ones? Arm Holdings tops the list – though mainly because so many investors and analysts agree that the UK chip designer’s destiny is to be taken over. That helps explain why its shares trade at 45 times this year’s expected earnings. The shares have risen 150 per cent since Arm joined the FTSE 100 index in February last year. That may have been the moment to invest if one believed in the takeover story. There must be better value in the FTSE 350 technology index, which trades at an average price to earnings ratio of 25.Two words of caution are in order. First, the HP/Autonomy deal ticks a lot of “special situations” boxes, not least an acquirer reinventing itself and a target that looks, at least to the buyer, to be a perfect fit. The deal’s separateness was put into focus by the collapse of two other tentative UK technology deals in recent days: private equity interest in Micro Focus (market value £530m) and Fidelity National’s approach for Misys (£1.4bn). Second, Autonomy was special in both the quality of management, led by chief executive Mike Lynch (what are the odds on him running HP soon?) and the nature of its lucrative technology. Investors who can identify those two magic ingredients stand to gain some nice takeover premiums. E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
13;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2011-08-04T21:54:27Z;One Aviva, but too many unwieldy businesses;;Four years ago Andrew Moss, Aviva chief executive, unveiled his “one Aviva, twice the value” programme in an effort to make the company an easier sell to investors and give the share price a bit of oomph.Thursday’s first-half results demonstrate how far he has come. The group is now a slightly easier sell – with the recent disposals of the RAC and a stake in Delta Lloyd, a Netherlands-based financial services group, Aviva says that for the first time investors have a clear view of what its future looks like. It has decent positions in life and general insurance in the UK and Europe, with access to more exciting markets elsewhere.Unfortunately for Mr Moss, investors do not seem to care. The shares have underperformed both the FTSE 100 and peers such as Prudential and Legal & General in the year to date and over one, three and five years.That is because, while Aviva is tidier than it used to be, it is still a lot less tidy than the likes of the Pru and L&G on the life assurance side, and RSA on the general insurance side. By buying shares in more focused companies, you can pick and choose how much exposure you want to specific markets. By buying shares in Aviva, you’re stuck with Mr Moss’s choice.So is it time for more radical change? The most obvious move would be to split life assurance from the general insurance business. Demergers are this season’s corporate fashion statement and a split would make life easier for investors.There are drawbacks to such a radical move, though. The conglomerate structure has financial advantages, such as allowing the group to use cash generated by general insurance to invest in growing markets elsewhere.But even if a demerger proves to be too difficult, there is scope for a more urgent shake-up. Aviva is still unwieldy, with too many businesses – such as some of its smaller emerging markets operations – contributing little to the overall picture. Their absence would give it a clearer story to tell.RSA springboardOne insurer that had a very clear story to tell on Thursday was RSA, with the news that Andy Haste, chief executive, is to leave after eight years in the job.He has built up quite a record. When he took over, RSA was a sprawling conglomerate in deep trouble. Through a series of disposals, including the UK life assurance operations and the US business, he turned things round and then started to invest in emerging markets. His most notable failure was an attempt to buy some of Aviva’s general insurance operations last year.The gossip in insurance circles will inevitably turn to what Mr Haste does next. The man himself is coy, insisting that he has no specific plans but still has enthusiasm for business challenges.Having proved that he has what it takes to turn round an unloved insurance group, speculation will surely centre on whether Aviva is next in line.Misys half-turnedOn one level, it does not matter to Mike Lawrie, chief executive of Misys, that a potential deal with Fidelity National Information Services fell through. The bid talks elevated the Misys share price above 400p for more than 20 days so Mr Lawrie now looks likely to receive all the share options he was granted when he took the helm in 2006.But there must be frustration at a job unfinished. Mr Lawrie came in five years ago to turn round and sell a UK business seen as something of a basket case. ValueAct, the activist shareholder that owns 20 per cent of Misys, was keen to extract value from the company within about five years. The time is almost up but only half the job is done.Mr Lawrie beefed up the healthcare software business and sold the division two years later for £670m. Most of the money was returned to shareholders.The remaining banking business has been tougher to shift. Analysts cite plenty of potential buyers, from Oracle to Temenos, but Fidelity was the only bidder. It has now looked at Misys twice and decided to walk away. The dispute this time was over price.Misys still has to prove its business has truly turned round. It has introduced a new software platform, BankFusion, but so far has just 40 customers. The acquisition of Sophis, an Irish rival, still has to be bedded in. In another year or so, if growth continues, Misys could be in a stronger position to ask for the 450p a share it is thought to have been looking for. The company will undoubtedly try again to find a buyer.
14;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Fidelity severs takeover talks with Misys;;Fidelity National Information Services, the US payment processing group, has walked away from its takeover approach for Misys, sending shares in the UK software provider tumbling almost 19 per cent.The two companies had been in talks since late June when Misys confirmed that it had received an all-cash preliminary approach from Fidelity that valued the British group at £1.4bn ($2.27bn).On Thursday, Misys said that the bid talks had been severed by Florida-based Fidelity, which provides technology services to roughly 14,000 clients in the financial sector across more than 100 countries.Fidelity said it would instead begin buying back its own shares under an existing repurchase programme.Frank Martire, Fidelity chief executive, said a buy-back would be a “very attractive use of capital at this time”.Misys shares closed down 18.7 per cent at 291.3p – well below the 384.5p that they were trading at before Fidelity’s approach. Fidelity shares were flat at $28.72.Analysts said the withdrawal of the bid reflected tougher trading in the financial software market in the past few months.Temenos, Misys’ Swiss rival, was forced to issue a profits warning last month as banks grew cautious on spending.Milan Radia, an analyst at Jefferies, said Fidelity might have been looking to renegotiate the price as market conditions grew tougher, and its ability to raise money from the deal may also have been constrained by tougher debt markets.Last week, Misys received a revised non-binding offer from Fidelity, which its board unanimously rejected as “materially undervaluing the company”, prompting it to withdraw from further discussions.However, Fidelity refused to increase its offer and did not offer a reason for walking away, but reserved the right to reinstate its offer should the board of Misys reconsider.“There are no other bidders for Misys at this stage, and we expect this process would have flushed out any other interest,” said Rajeev Bahl, analyst at Matrix.Misys on Thursday shrugged off the offer withdrawal, telling the Financial Times: “We are confident about the future of the company. It’s back to business as usual.”Last week Misys, whose core banking unit has a 1,200-strong customer base, announced a 4 per cent increase in full-year revenues to £370m, and a 12 per cent increase in underlying profit to £72m. Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profit fell from £45m to £32.2m.In spite of being the target of a takeover approach, Misys has continued to look for bolt-on acquisitions itself, considering a possible bid for Kondor, the Thomson Reuters trade and risk management software business.
15;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2011-07-28T21:19:11Z;Misys seeks bolt-on acquisitions;;Mike Lawrie, chief executive of Misys, said the banking software company was continuing to look for bolt-on acquisitions, even as the group itself is in talks to be acquired by Fidelity National Information Services.Mr Lawrie said the company was considering a bid for Kondor, the Thomson Reuters trade and risk management software business, and would look for other deals to extend the reach of its treasury and capital markets business, which is considered by many analysts to be the growth engine of the company.The company strengthened its treasury and capital markets business at the end of last year when it bought Irish rival Sophis for £235m ($384m) .Mr Lawrie said talks with US-based Fidelity were continuing but he declined to comment on the progress of the discussions.The company confirmed in June that it was in bid talks and investors had expected a deal to be announced by this month.“We are running the Misys business as business as usual, and we have a lot of confidence in the business after a strong set of results,” Mr Lawrie said.Misys reported a 4 per cent increase in revenues to £370m for the year to the end of May. This included a return to growth for the banking division, which had gained 40 customers for the BankFusion software it launched 18 months ago. Mr Lawrie is aiming for 250 customers over the next few years.The TCM business, however, suffered a setback in the second half as a new product, Opics Plus, had to be temporarily withdrawn after problems were discovered with the software. The TCM business had grown 11 per cent in the first half, but full-year sales rose just 3 per cent.Pre-tax profit fell 28 per cent to £32.2m as Misys faced a number of exceptional charges and fees related to the acquisition of Sophis and the disposal of Allscripts, the company’s healthcare software business, last year.Plans for more bolt-on acquisitions and solid sales growth are good to have, just in case talks with Fidelity don’t come to fruition. Misys’ valuation recently has been all about a possible take-out price, expected to be somewhere in the 420p to 450p a share range. Misys shares briefly reached 430p in June after the talks were confirmed but have drifted down since then to less than 400p as concerns have grown that macroeconomic uncertainty could disrupt the deal. At 19 times estimated earnings for next year, Misys’ valuation is fairly full. However, the revenue growth shows that its turnround strategy is finally working, and there is a sense among investors that this is a reasonable business, and even if Fidelity doesn’t buy it, someone else will.Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui
16;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2011-06-22T20:35:04Z;FIS Global revealed as Misys bidder;;FIS Global, the US listed payment services provider, has made the preliminary bid for UK software company Misys, according to people familiar with the situation.Misys, which provides software for banks, said on Tuesday that it had received a preliminary bid approach, following recent speculation, and while it declined to name the bidder, its share price rose nearly 9 per cent giving it a market value of $1.4bn.Talks over the possible offer – which would be for the whole of the business – are progressing and could be resolved within a month. However, the terms of the US provider’s bid are still unclear and Misys warned on Tuesday that the approach “may or may not lead to an offer being made”.FIS has lined up Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank to advise it, while Misys is being advised by Barclays Capital and JPMorgan, according to the people.All parties involved declined to comment.FIS, which is also known as Fidelity National Information Services, is based in Florida and provides core banking technology and card payments processing to banks. For example it processes some foreign exchange payments for the UK Post Office.It was formerly a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial, but was spun off into a separate, publicly traded and NYSE-listed company in 2006.FIS had revenues of $5.27bn in 2010 and net earnings of $404.5m, dwarfing Misys, which had revenues of £782m last year. FIS has a market value of $9.57bn, compared with £1.4bn for Misys.FIS is no stranger to large acquisitions, having bought Metavante, a Milwaukee-based banking technology company, in 2009 in a $2.94bn stock deal. Last year it made a smaller purchase of Capco, a banking technology consultancy.Last year it became the subject of a potential takeover itself, as US buyout groups Blackstone, Thomas H Lee and TPG considered a $15bn approach.However, the talks broke down over price, in the wake of the Greek debt crisis. Instead, FIS repurchased $2.5bn of its common stock in 2010 in a leveraged recapitalisation.Analysts on Tuesday said an offer for Misys could reach 500p a share, implying a £1.8bn value. At more than 20 times next year’s expected earnings, this makes Misys more expensive than peers such as Temenos, the Geneva-headquartered software company, at 16 times forecast earnings.FIS had cash of about $384.1m at the end of March this year, and about $5bn in outstanding debt.Shares in Misys closed down 2 per cent on Wednesday at 410.4p, a 40 per cent increase year on year. FIS Global, whose shares are listed on the NYSE, were trading at $31.10 late Wednesday, up 15 per cent year on year.

One person familiar with the auction said Emirates NBD was valuing the payments processing business at $1bn to $1.5bn.Morgan Stanley is advising on the sale.“The business has attracted serious international attention,” said one person close to the auction. “It’s hard to say where the valuation will end up as other businesses worldwide are being sold at a premium, so haggling is going to go on.”Network International has operations across the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait and Lebanon.Payment processing companies are particularly attractive in emerging markets, where there is more scope for expansion into online and mobile payment services.Emirates NBD is one of several UAE banks moving to shore up its balance sheet after the credit crunch and the Dubai property crash put regional banks under pressure.The sale would raise cash for the bank, but it would also allow Network International to expand into more third-party contracts by becoming more independent from Emirates NBD.TPG has been in the running for RBS’s payment processing unit and was part of a consortium preparing a $15bn take-private bid for FIS. The Emirates Investment Authority is a sovereign wealth fund created in 2007.Abraaj is the Middle East’s biggest private equity group and has kept its powder dry since the economic downturn. Silverlake is the world’s biggest technology-focused private equity group based in California with $14bn of assets under management.

Shares were up 5.9 per cent at $27.73.US stocks struggled for direction as investors cycled out of financial and technology shares and into companies tied to the physical economy.Homebuilder shares were higher after the US commerce department reported that seasonally adjusted April housing starts rose 5.8 per cent over March, topping expectations. Permits for new homes fell 11.5 per cent versus March, though they had jumped sharply higher in previous months.Lennar gained 2 per cent to $18.78, while KB Home declined 0.5 per cent to $16.27. The sector is broadly up 19 per cent year-to-date on a rebound in new home sales.“The starts and permits data offer encouragement that the worst of the housing downturn is over,” said Thomas Simons, market economist at Jefferies.After opening higher, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 1,135.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was flat at 10,629.98. Nasdaq shares were 0.5 per cent lower at 2,341.55.The worst performing sector on the day was information technology. The dip was led by financial technology providers after Visa and MasterCard, which own payment networks, saw further regulatory scrutiny.A proposal was introduced on Tuesday to allow states to cap credit-card interest rates. That comes after an amendment to the financial reform package, introduced late last week, to allow the Federal Reserve to more closely regulate debit card fees. A top Discover Card executive described the changes as “volcanic”.Visa dipped 4.4 per cent, to $71.44. MasterCard fell 4.3 per cent to $201.85.

19;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Buy-out activity hampered by financial climate;;The decision by private equity groups Blackstone, TPG and THL to abandon their planned $15bn offer for Fidelity National Information Services comes at a time when the favourable financing conditions that have stirred buy-out activity in recent months may be coming to an end.In recent weeks, the cost of debt in both the loan market and the bond market has started to move up.Rates in the high-yield bond market have increased from lows of about 8 per cent to levels of about 8.75 per cent, while rates on leveraged loans have gone up 25 to 50 basis points.Bankers and private equity executives said buy-out deals of up to $10bn in value were still under discussion and could happen in the next few weeks.But they cautioned that further deterioration in financing conditions could scuttle some deals.“Investors are walking on eggshells now,” said the head of capital markets of one bank involved in the Fidelity National Information Services bid.“They don’t want to pay par today [for debt used in a buy-out deal] if they think it is going to 96 [cents] tomorrow.”The three private equity firms walked away from Fidelity National Information Services, a payments processor that is known as FIS, mainly over the issue of price, according to several people familiar with the matter.The bidders were also concerned by financing issues, these people said. One problem came in the form of a demand from the banks involved in the deal that they be able to change the terms of loans if the credit rating for FIS worsened.Banks typically seek these kinds of protections when markets turn volatile, as has been the case in recent weeks as investors have grown more worried about instability in Europe.The head of capital markets for one of the banks in the FIS deal said the issue of ratings flexibility alone would not have scuttled the transaction, but did concern the bidders as the talks proceeded.“If the board had accepted a $32-per-share bid, we would have been there,” the banker said.“We would have been nervous, but we would have been there. We just need to compensate for the risk.”There are a handful of announced buy-out deals seeking financing in the market today, including American Tire and SkillSoft.Planned deals to borrow money to pay private equity owners dividends had been cut back or postponed, bankers said.
20;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Blackstone-led consortium drops bid for FNIS;;Private equity firms Blackstone, TPG and THL have abandoned their planned $15bn bid for Fidelity National Information Services after the board of the payments processor sought a higher price, people familiar with the matter said late on Monday.The deal, though never announced, would have been by far the biggest leveraged buy-out since the financial crisis began. “The board thought they could push them, but the premium was already huge,” said one person familiar with the situation.Another private equity firm, Warburg Pincus – which owns 10 per cent of Fidelity National Information Services and has representation on the company’s board – opposed the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.A spokeswoman for Warburg Pincus could not be immediately reached for comment. Spokesmen for the potenial private equity bidders declined to comment.During the bubble years, private equity firms often formed groups that bid for big public companies and took them private, using mountains of debt and only small slivers of their own capital. Following the financial crisis, many private equity executives said their investors wanted to see buy-out firms exercise more discipline.However, in recent months, the high-yield debt markets have been increasingly willing to finance buy-outs. The Fidelity National Information Services deal would have been financed with almost $10bn of debt.It is possible that the private equity firms’ decision to walk away from their bid partly reflects an assessment that interest rates are going up as the continuing uncertainty in Europe spooks investors.Fidelity National Information Services, which provides banking and payment technology to more than 14,000 financial institutions worldwide, last year had net income of $105.9m.
21;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2010-05-06T22:58:41Z;Private equity groups plan $10bn bid for FIS;;Three of the world’s leading private equity groups are teaming up to attempt the biggest buyout since the financial crisis, eyeing a bid for payments processor Fidelity National Information Services that would easily exceed $10bn, people familiar with the deal said.The groups, Blackstone, THL and TPG, would all invest equally in an offer for the company, known as FIS, that could be launched within two weeks.Blackstone and THL initially approached FIS, according to the people familiar with the situation, and were later joined by TPG.They cautioned, however, that there were numerous challenges facing the deal, including potential fallout from the European debt crisis, and that the talks could fall apart.FIS declined to comment. All of the private equity groups declined to comment.The talks, first reported in the Wall Street Journal, began in recent weeks against the backdrop of recovering bond markets and a growing willingness by banks to back buyout deals.Private equity groups, meanwhile, are aiming to spend the billions that they raised before the crisis. According to Preqin, a research provider, buyout funds globally are sitting on more than $500bn in so-called “dry powder”.Sources close to the deal suggested the financing package could reach $10bn. It would be led by Bank of America and JPMorgan, with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital and Credit Suisse also likely to participate, the sources said.The lead banks would take up to $2bn each to syndicate, these people added, with the private equity groups contributing as much as 30 per cent of the deal value in equity.In recent deals, buyout funds have been asked to contribute more equity.FIS shares on Thursday rose 10.3 per cent to $28.68, giving it a market value of $10.8bn. The company had about $3.1bn of debt at the end of the first quarter. FIS, which last year had net income of $105.9m, provides banking and payment technology to more than 14,000 financial institutions worldwide.Five years ago, THL and TPG failed in an attempt to buy FIS, later investing $500m for a 25 per cent stake before the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The two groups sold part of their stakes a year later, but THL still owns 4 per cent of the company, said people familiar with the matter.
22;FIS;Fidelity National Information Services;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
