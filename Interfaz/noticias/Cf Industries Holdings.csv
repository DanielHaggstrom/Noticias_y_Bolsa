This is exactly the kind of tax scheme I wanted Treasury to crack down on, and here’s proof that the new regulations are working.”CF will pay a break fee of $150m to OCI, which is run by Nassef Sawiris, Egypt’s richest man and the company’s chief executive. Shares in OCI fell almost 10 per cent to €12.22, giving it a market value €2.6bn. CF shares rose 6.3 per cent to $30.40 just after midday in New York.The OCI deal was Mr Will’s second failed attempt to clinch a tax inversion transaction. An earlier attempt to combine with Norway’s Yara International was also unsuccessful.Under a complex deal first agreed in August, CF would have set up its headquarters in the UK after buying OCI’s North America and Europe businesses. By doing so, the Illinois-based company would have been able to reduce its corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent.The move prompted fury from some US lawmakers including from Dick Durbin, the senior US senator from Illinois, who called CF’s plans “simply wrong”.After Treasury took some steps to crack down on inversions last year, CF and OCI modified their planned transaction and said the new company’s headquarters would be in the Netherlands.But the Obama administration further roiled the international mergers market in April by announcing a series of additional and unexpectedly aggressive steps to thwart inversions. The Treasury declined to comment on the decision by CF and OCI.I’m glad to see American taxpayers won’t have to foot the bill for another giant company that wants all the benefits of doing business in the United States while skipping out on its taxesThe administration’s moves made it harder for deals to qualify as inversions — and gain the attendant tax benefits — by changing the way the size of the companies is calculated.They also made it more difficult for inverted companies to minimise their US tax bills using a technique known as “earnings stripping”, which involves using internal loans to American subsidiaries to reduce taxable income.Sander Levin, a senior member of the House of Representatives, told the Financial Times: “Today’s announcement from CF Industries shows that Treasury’s actions are already having their intended effect of protecting the US tax base and stopping corporate tax inversions.”Rosa DeLauro, another House Democrat who welcomed the end of the fertiliser deal, said: “Every year, hardworking Americans fulfil their civic duty to pay taxes and it is completely outrageous that corporations exploit the US tax code to avoid doing the same.”The deal’s collapse will be a blow to CF, which has been facing lower margins because of lower fertiliser prices. Grain prices remain relatively low and China is flooding international market with lower-grade nitrogen fertilisers, pushing down the price.The sharp fall in natural gas prices had prompted new players into the nitrogen market, threatening margins at leading nitrogen fertiliser players such as CF, Koch Industries, PotashCorp and Agrium“The deal’s collapse will mean that CF has a weakened position . . . An independent OCI can only increase competition among suppliers for business, pushing prices and margins lower for all North America producers as a wave of new US capacity comes to market,” said Alistair Wallace, principal at consultancy CRU.A deal would have allowed CF to gain control of OCI’s new plant in Iowa, in the heart of the US corn belt. It will produce urea ammonium nitrate, a high-quality nitrogen fertiliser.

The continued struggle for manufacturers underscores the complexity of the decision faced by policymakers on when the Fed should raise interest rates.In commodities, US crude oil prices dipped by 0.7 per cent to $48.08 a barrel.The US dollar slipped by 0.1 per cent against a basket of six global currencies, but the greenback is set for its biggest monthly rise in half-a-year.
2;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2016-05-23T06:10:22Z;CF Industries-OCI deal nixed in tax inversion crackdown;;CF Industries’ proposed $8bn takeover of the European and North American assets of Dutch rival OCI has fallen apart amid the latest US government crackdown on so-called tax inversion deals, whereby companies seek to cut their tax bill by acquiring a foreign company.Last August the US agricultural fertiliser maker said it had agreed to acquire the assets in a deal that would have made it one of the largest nitrogen fertiliser makers in the world. As part of that agreement, the Illinois-based company would have redomiciled in the UK to benefit from a lower tax regime.However in April the US Treasury announced it was taking additional steps to curb inversions, saying they are draining billions of dollars from the US tax system.On Monday Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, said that “changes in the regulatory and commercial environments” had forced a rethink. From the groups’ joint statement:The Treasury announcement on April 4, 2016 materially reduced the structural synergies of the combination. Since that time, both companies have worked together collaboratively to explore alternative transactions and structures that would be attractive to their respective shareholders. However, the companies were unable to identify an alternative acceptable to both parties and, therefore, agreed to terminate the combination.CF will pay OCI a termination fee of $150m. Nassef Sawiris, chief executive of OCI, added:Despite not having been able to reach an agreement on an alternative transaction or structure, we have the utmost respect for CF’s management and I would like to thank Tony and his team for all the effort.The level of goodwill and collaboration between the two companies has been positive at all levels of management since our discussions started last year, which leads me to believe that in the future we can explore alternative ways of collaboration or structures to create value for our respective shareholders.
3;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2016-04-05T18:06:15Z;Washington slams shut Pfizer’s tax loophole;Rule tweaks are not the answer to a dysfunctional system;"When a public outcry greeted the announcement of Pfizer’s tax-driven $160bn takeover of Allergan last year, Ian Read, the US pharmaceuticals group’s boss, expressed astonishment that anyone might want to frustrate such a bounteous transaction.Far from a scandal, it was, he said, “a great deal for the US, given that it frees us up to invest in American science”.Even then, this was an eccentric interpretation and it is one that Washington has now comprehensively rejected. A number of US Treasury rules, announced on Monday, place fresh obstacles in the path not only of so-called inversions whereby US companies cut their tax bills if they move their domicile to another country. They also put a barrier directly in the path of Mr Read’s tax-inverting Allergan deal.The administration has tightened the rules that require the non-US party to such a transaction to own at least 20 per cent of the combined group for the new entity to invert and move offshore. These now ignore any shares issued by that company to buy US businesses or assets over the previous three years, thus reducing the “qualifying” stake that determines whether it can obtain the tax benefits from the deal.The change will specifically catch Allergan, which has more than doubled in size through two US deals since 2014, and thus cut — or even eliminate — the fiscal benefits of putting the two sides together. The market has delivered its verdict: Allergan shares have fallen by more than 15 per cent.Few will mourn the upsetting of Mr Read’s latest attempt at fiscal Houdini-ism disguised as an industrial transaction. Politicians from all parties have lined up to attack the unseemliness of a publicly supported pharmaceuticals industry gleefully exploiting tax loopholes.But Washington is not depending on this surgical strike alone to deter the practice of inversions. The Treasury has also ordained another rule of more general application. This will remove the debt interest shield in situations where a non-US company lends to its American subsidiary not to fund specific investments, but primarily to cut its 35 per cent corporate tax rate.This not only makes it harder to achieve the benefits of inversion; it also serves a wider anti-avoidance purpose. It will make it much trickier for multinationals to “manage” their US corporate tax liability by using inter-company loans to carry their profits off to more easy-going climes.There is nothing magical about debt interest that requires it to be tax deductible. There is much to be said for evening up the playing field between corporations with global operations, for whom such tax arbitrages are possible, and smaller companies that have to pay the full whack.But these short-term fixes will do little to resolve the deeper problems with America’s dysfunctional corporate tax code. The system already is a rolling bonanza for clever lawyers and accountants.It would be far better for the White House to grit its teeth and embark on wider reform. Inversions, after all, do not exist in isolation. They are the consequence of an ill-designed tax regime.At 35 per cent, US corporate tax is among the highest in the developed world. Yet while Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, talks about the need for legislative action, the White House has disdained expending political capital on wider measures. This cannot be the final answer. Constant rule tweaks cannot deliver both fairness and simplicity. The corporate world keeps throwing down the fiscal gauntlet. One day politicians need to pick it up."

West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, fell as low as $26.21 on February 11 but has since rallied hard, rising 42 per cent. On Monday it was up 5.6 per cent at $37.94.The advance comes as the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has dropped to the lowest level since 2009 and as Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to freeze crude output at January levels.The materials sector, whose fortunes are shaped by the outlook for the Chinese economy, also had a better showing with a 1.2 per cent increase. CF Industries was the biggest gainer in the materials sector, advancing 6.6 per cent to $36.88, while shares in Alcoa gained 4.9 per cent to $10.04.The sector was helped after China’s Premier Li Keqiang laid out a plan to target growth of between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent this year — more ambitious than many economists had forecast.Anxiety about the Chinese economy is enduring a significant retreat from the double-digit growth that marked much of the last two decades and has been one of the several drags on the US stock market in 2016.Monday, though, proved a calmer day for the wider stock market. By the close of markets in New York, the S&P 500, the broadest gauge of large-cap US stocks, had edged up 0.1 per cent to 2,001.76. After a three-week rally, the index has trimmed its loss for the year to 2 per cent from 10 per cent.The relative lack of direction was echoed by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.4 per cent at 17,073.95, and the Nasdaq Composite, down 0.2 per cent to 4,708.25.Elsewhere, gold miners advanced on Monday as the precious metal advanced ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy setting meeting next week. Expectations for a rate rise in March remain low and that has bolstered sentiment for the non-yielding precious metal.Gold prices have advanced more than 19 per cent so far this year and hit a 13-month high in the previous trading session.Shares in Barrick Gold advanced 1 per cent to $13.86, while shares in Newmont Mining climbed 1.6 per cent to $26.53. Shares in Kinross Gold advanced 0.8 per cent to $3.02 and AngloGold Ashanti shares rose 3.7 per cent to $13.40.Shares in Celldex Therapeutics fell 53.7 per cent to $3.79, after the biopharmaceutical company said it would discontinue a late-stage study of its brain cancer treatment, Rintega, after an independent interim analysis showed disappointing results.Meanwhile, shares in Dunkin’ Brands, the company behind Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, fell 2.4 per cent to $46.97 after analysts at Guggenheim Securities downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”.
5;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2015-10-30T17:51:49Z;Pfizer deal provokes further anger over tax inversions;Obama administration eyes measures to crack down on domicile-shifting mergers;The Obama administration is moving towards finalising measures to deter mergers designed to slash US companies’ taxes as further outrage over the deals is stoked by Pfizer, the drugmaker.After a 13-month wait, the US Treasury could announce a second round of action to deter the inversion deals before the end of this year, say well-connected Washington tax experts.Pfizer thrust the deals back into the spotlight this week by confirming it was in talks with Allergan over a $120bn takeover.Acquiring Allergan would allow Pfizer to complete a tax inversion by switching its domicile from the US to Europe, in a move that would slash the amount of American corporation tax it pays. Allergan paid an effective tax rate of 4.8 per cent last year versus 25.5 per cent for Pfizer.The talks triggered more condemnation of the deals from politicians in Washington, where Democrats and Republicans have railed against them for hollowing out the US tax base.Senator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat and leading critic of inversions, said: “When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab. That isn’t right.”Policymakers, however, have struggled to find a way to put a stop to them.In September 2014 the Treasury announced a first round of anti-inversion measures— which sought to make the deals more difficult and reduce their economic appeal — and promised more.A Treasury spokeswoman said: “We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action.” She declined to comment on the timing of its impending measures or the Pfizer-Allergan talks.Although the Treasury’s steps last year initially chilled inversions, the deterrent effect soon faded.At least six companies have successfully struck inversions since it acted, including large transactions this year by Coca-Cola Enterprises, one of Coke’s main bottlers, and CF Industries , the fertiliser maker. And a handful of others have been attempted.Talks to create world’s largest drugmaker face US tax and price hurdlesRead moreThe Treasury spokeswoman said “there is a limit to what we can do administratively” and repeated the administration’s longstanding call for Congress to stop inversions by changing the law, which was unlikely in the near future due partly to bad blood on Capitol Hill.Steve Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a think-tank, has discussed anti-inversion measures with Treasury officials and said the conditions for further action had fallen into place.“Treasury had laid the groundwork, the need for those measures is clear as more companies migrate abroad, and the political impediments have now disappeared, so everything is aligned for them to do something,” he said.The Obama administration had been waiting to see if Paul Ryan’s chairmanship of the House of Representatives’ tax committee this year would spur legislative reform, but turmoil in the Republican party and his elevation to House speaker this week have upended things.In addition, Mr Rosenthal noted, the buzz of the 2016 presidential election is increasing and President Barack Obama’s remaining time in office is shrinking. “I expect [Treasury action] is only a matter of political will now. The technical people are well informed.”The Treasury measures are expected to curb the attractions of “earnings stripping”, a process of loading up US subsidiaries with debt owed to foreign head offices so that the interest payments — often substantial — can be deducted from their US taxable income.Sandy Levin, the top Democrat on the House tax-writing committee, said: “Congress must realise that while the administration’s [initial] actions to curb tax inversions have had some impact, as companies continue to contemplate possible tax inversions, it is our responsibility to act to address this loophole once and for all.”Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi

The transaction consolidates CF Industries’ position in North America while giving it an international distribution network.An Obama administration crackdown to stop US businesses pursuing takeovers that let them escape the country’s high corporate tax regime was dealt a sharp rebuke on Thursday, after two deals paved the way for more companies to move their domicile to Europe.Continue readingCF Industries will own about 72 per cent of the combined company and move to the UK as part of the deal. By doing so, it will in effect be able to reduce its corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent.Mr Durbin has singled out other inversions, often involving companies in his home state of Illinois, as the pace of these deals has increased markedly in the past two years. At least 15 inversions were reached in 2014 before the US Treasury took specific actions to reduce the attractiveness of these deals.But the Obama administration and senators such as Mr Durbin have failed to muster support to pass legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress to further inhibit these deals.Deal advisers have said that interest in such deals has picked up once again and that more tax inversions are being attempted, including Monsanto’s $45bn pursuit of Swiss agribusiness rival Syngenta. Mr Durbin has also urged Monsanto’s leadership not to pursue an inversion as part of its bidding efforts.At least one large inversion collapsed last year; Illinois-based AbbVie’s $53bn takeover of UK drugmaker Shire, owing to the crackdown by the US Treasury. Walgreens, another Illinois-based company that Mr Durbin has criticised, also decided not to pursue an inversion last year as part of its deal with Alliance Boots.CF Industries said it would respond to Mr Durbin when it was ready.Start rewriting the archaic US tax laws, Sen Durbin / From Christopher S Buckingham"

The merger brings to six the total of tax inversion deals struck since the US Treasury sought to crack down on the practice.More are being discussed, dealmakers have said, including Monsanto’s $45bn pursuit of its Swiss agribusiness rival Syngenta.Last week, the US Treasury said in a statement that it is continuing to review a broad range of options for further anti-inversion measures. But the Obama administration has failed to muster the support it needs to pass legislation through the Republican-controlled Congress to clamp down on the practice.US companies have regained their appetite for foreign takeovers that allow them to move overseas and escape US taxes, in spite of a White House crackdown to restrict tax inversions last year. According to several senior corporate advisers in the US and Europe, demand for such deals has picked up and raised the expectation that more transactions will be announced this year.Continue readingBilled as “merger of equals”, the Terex deal will involve its shareholders receiving 0.80 Konecranes shares for each of their existing shares.They will own 60 per cent of the combined company, with investors in the Finnish company holding the remaining 40 per cent.Konecranes chairman Stig Gustavson will take up the same role in the new company, while Terex will pick a chief executive. It is unclear whether Ron Defeo, Terex chief executive, will stay with the combined company.Terex will nominate five directors to a new nine-member board, while Konecranes will elect the remainder.A share buy-back programme worth up to $1.5bn will be launched after the deal closes in the first half of 2016.Both groups are seeking cost savings and aim to cut $121m within three years. An additional $35m boost to post-tax income is expected “from financing, cash management and structure optimisation, implemented within first year after closing”, they said.Shares in Konecranes rose 19.3 per cent to €33.43 while Terex climbed 22 per cent to $26.67 in premarket New York trading.Perella Weinberg Partners and Skadden Arps advised Konecranes.
8;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2015-08-06T19:19:40Z;Deals challenge US inversions clampdown;Revival in tax-driven transactions show limits of Treasury efforts;An Obama administration crackdown to stop US businesses pursuing takeovers that let them escape the country’s high corporate tax regime was dealt a sharp rebuke on Thursday, after two deals paved the way for more companies to move their domicile to Europe.In separate transactions, three of Coca-Cola’s European bottlers agreed a $27.5bn merger to form the region’s largest distributor of Coke products, while fertiliser maker CF Industries acquired assets from rival OCI for $8bn including debt.Both will create new UK-based companies in so-called tax inversion deals, highlighting corporate America’s desire to move its tax base overseas.The deals are a further indication that efforts last year by the US Treasury — and backed by President Barack Obama who labelled inversions as “unpatriotic” — have failed to stem interest in the manoeuvre.At least 15 companies successfully struck inversions last year before the Treasury took action to limit the attraction of such deals.Including Thursday’s activity, five large inversions have been agreed in 2015 and several more attempts are under way, including Monsanto’s $45bn pursuit of Switzerland’s Syngenta.Advisers said that the appetite for inversions has been at fever pitch again in recent months, as the Obama administration failed to gather congressional support to pass legislation intended to further stymie these deals with important tax components.Frank Aquila, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, said: “US companies will continue to seek opportunities to level the playing field until Congress and the president recognise that the US tax code disadvantages US businesses.”Dealmakers believe more large inversion deals are coming, given the reluctance of a Republican majority in Congress to clamp down on deals without an agreement for broader tax reform.Three of Europe’s main bottlers of Coca-Cola products are to combine in a $27bn deal to simplify manufacturing at the world’s largest drink maker as it seeks to cut costs at a time when consumers are shifting away from its fizzy drinks.Read on . . .Christopher Cox, chairman of the corporate practice at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, said companies were still able to navigate the Treasury actions to complete beneficial inversions.“The new regulations removed the benefits of so-called ‘hopscotch’ loans, which allow trapped offshore cash to be used to finance inversion transactions,” said Mr Cox. “But the door to do tax inversions is still wide open and for many companies it is still a very effective way to cut tax costs.”The Treasury pledged last year to introduce a second round of anti-inversion measures and a spokeswoman said on Thursday: “We are continuing to review a broad range of authorities for further anti-inversion measures to close loopholes that permit some taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and we expect to issue additional guidance to further limit inversion transactions in due course.”The revival in inversions is helping to accelerate the pace of dealmaking since inverted companies have tax advantages over their non-inverted US rivals when seeking further acquisitions.Foreign-domiciled companies have spent $315bn since January to buy US-domiciled targets, according to S&P Capital IQ, close to the record for the whole of 2007, the previous peak.Many of these acquirers have been assisted by a lower tax rate, allowing them to compete more aggressively against would-be US acquirers. That is putting pressure on US companies, who complain that the US tax code is hurting their ability to compete globally.$315bnSpending on US-domiciled targets by foreign acquirers since JanuarySteve Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank said the Obama administration had been distracted by efforts on Capitol Hill — so far fruitless — to overhaul tax laws as part of an infrastructure bill.“But who’s to say Congress will do anything? We’ve been waiting for a decade. It behoves Treasury to write [more anti-inversion] regulations on their own to the extent they can,” he said.The White House would not comment on specific companies, but a spokeswoman said President Obama had made clear that Congress needed to act to close “one of the most unfair tax loopholes that allows” inversions.“Our organisation will be driven by marketing concentrate, not by bottling”, said a Coca-Cola Company executive at a recent investor event. Alas the Coke supply chain is not as simple as the soda’s formula of high fructose corn syrup and water.Read on“While [Treasury secretary] Jack Lew has announced steps that the Treasury department is taking to reduce the benefits of this loophole, only Congress can close this loophole entirely, and the president continues to call on Congress to act,” she said.While Coca-Cola Enterprises has not operated in the US since 2010, the US-based company with the exclusive licence to bottle Coke products in several western European countries has built a large overseas cash pile.It will be able to access its non-US profits at a much lower rate than if it were to repatriate the funds. Coca-Cola Enterprises will own 48 per cent of Coca-Cola European Partners, which will be formed from a combination with its Iberian and German counterparts.Meanwhile, CF Industries has the highest tax rate among its peers at 35 per cent. The deal for OCI will allow it to lower that rate to 20 per cent, the company said.
9;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

Last year Yara and CF tried to merge but the deal fell apart after they failed to win shareholder support for the transaction.The deal comes as farmers around the world have seen their incomes fall due to plentiful harvests. Lower grain prices have meant that their ability to spend on agricultural “inputs” such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides has declined sharply.The agricultural backdrop has led to squeezed profit margins for agribusinesses and increased the pressure to seek growth and higher margins through mergers and acquisitions.In the fertiliser sector, PotashCorp of Saskatchewan has been pursuing K+S of Germany, while Monsanto, the US seeds and pesticide group, is wooing Swiss rival Syngenta after its overtures were rebuffed.“This is a terrific opportunity for the shareholders of both companies, with mid- to high-teens cash flow accretion,” said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer of CF. “This is also a great outcome for US farmers as we have another supply point that will ensure our critical products are delivered reliably and in time to meet our customers’ needs.”CF’s profit margins are among the highest in the fertiliser industry. However, it has a limited international network at a time when the US market is rapidly reaching saturation point. OCI, which used to be an Egyptian-based company, will provide them with the opportunity to expand globally by providing them access to new markets.The companies said the deal included OCI’s nitrogen production facilities in the Netherlands and Iowa as well as the Dutch company’s interest in an ammonia and methanol complex in Texas. Also included is OCI’s global distribution business based in Dubai.Once the deal is completed CF shareholders will control about 72 per cent of the new combined company and OCI investors would own approximately 28 per cent.

Sometime fox hunter Stephen Hester finds himself the quarry as Zurich Insurance considers a £5bn-plus bid for RSA, the non-life retail insurer of which he is chief executive. But the former banker will give the Swiss gnomes a run for their money. He has produced strong first-half results as evidence that his turnround plan is working.Zurich, in contrast, announced disappointing quarterly net profits. These were 1 per cent lower at $840m, compared with forecasts of a 12.8 per cent rise, according to Reuters. But the behemoth enjoys greater certainty on capital than RSA because it is based outside the EU. It has a $3bn surplus and would pay cash for RSA.Time is the enemy of Mr Hester, who came in as a troubleshooter 18 months ago. He has promised that RSA will raise returns on tangible equity to 12-15 per cent in 2017. But progress has so far appeared patchier than at Aviva, where Mark Wilson and John McFarlane pulled off a near-perfect turnround, and at motor and home insurer Direct Line under Paul Geddes.Today’s numbers give the bears — and Zurich — something to chew on. ROTE is a volatile number but has risen from about 5 per cent to almost 10 per cent at the half-year stage. Group operating profits, which exclude disposal gains, are almost £120m higher at £259m.Analysts have suggested a Zurich bid at 550p per share — a premium of 27 per cent to where RSA typically trades — could end the group’s independence. Mr Hester and the RSA board could justifiably ask for up to 600p, equivalent to the same premium at the earnings ratio of a better-rated rival.Zurich has the whip hand. But Brer Fox has a habit of bettering his persecutors. Lombard recently installed a high-pitched “scarer” to protect his flower beds from an urban fox. The fox uses it as a handy landmark on which to relieve himself.Bring us the not-so poorA new slew of tax inversion deals suggests that London should erect a Statue of Tax Liberty. How about an effigy of mayor Boris Johnson, one hand raising a champagne glass, the other clutching his Plutarch?The trend is underlined by US and continental groups planning to combine and headquarter in the UK. Corporation tax is falling to 18 per cent here but is over 30 per cent in the US and Germany. The appeal is obvious, even if the difference between effective rates is less stark.There’s already plenty of coke in London, particularly in some West End clubs on Saturday night. But Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bottles the Real Thing, will still relocate here from the US after merging with Iberian and German affiliates, though it is fair to point out initial tax savings will be negligible. Fertiliser, augmenting that talked at the London Assembly, will be supplied by CF Industries, which plans to move to the UK after buying the European and North American assets of Dutch rival OCI.A cynic would suspect CCE and CFI of picking a month when many US lawmakers are frolicking beside a lake or ocean. Bolder Democrat-baiting transactions may follow in the autumn. Forestalling determined inverters would require prohibitive US laws (impractical) or cutting taxes on US corporates and raising those on individuals (unthinkable).Wasn’t the chancellor promising to battle tax havens internationally a few years ago? He is now more likely to be spotted talking defence tactics with the Liechtenstein delegation. Brits who boycotted Starbucks for failing to pay tax on UK losses will not even notice the shift.Super party pooperThe Principal, the shadowy figure who runs the City of London behind the scenes, has directed us to print this communiqué:“The Bank of England’s inaugural Super Thursday has drawn my attention to an unseemly clustering of announcements on the fourth day of the week.

12;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2015-01-08T18:06:31Z;Yara: piece of this;Low natural gas prices and a strong dollar boost Yara;"Oil prices have collapsed. So market pundits and traders scurry around like crazed chickens looking for beneficiaries. Well, look no further than Yara, the Norwegian fertiliser company. Its shares have jumped a quarter in the last month taking its forward price-to-earnings ratio (13 times) towards the higher end of its 10-year range.Crop prices are the usual suspect when it comes to explaining the share price moves in Yara and rivals such as CF Industries in the US. Higher agriculture commodity prices lead to more planting by farmers. These commodities have been tumbling. Corn has been one of the worst performing commodities over the past three years, down 38 per cent. Soybeans, which many farmers plant instead of corn, has fallen too, though by less. Fertiliser companies like it when farmers plant corn; it requires six times more fertiliser per acre to grow than soybeans. So it is good news for Yara and its rivals that corn has rallied 15 per cent in the past few months, more than any other actively traded commodity. No surprise that Yara shares have been doing well.The real boost for Yara, though, has come from lower natural gas prices. Makers of nitrogen-based fertilisers benefit from this because gas is used to make the ammonia, the building block for nitrogen products. According to Yara, a decline of $1 per million British thermal units in the European gas price could lift its operating profit by $145m, more than a tenth of the total. Even better, the natural gas hub price (at Zeebrugge in Belgium) has dropped sharply in the past month due to a warm winter. It is now down a third, the equivalent of over $3, year on year. Currency moves also help. Fertiliser prices are primarily based in US dollars. But most of Yara’s assets are in Europe, so its overhead costs are primarily in euros and Norwegian krone. A weak euro with a strong dollar is therefore an ideal scenario.Add that to the falling oil price and the chance of more corn planting as the price of that commodity rises, and there is plenty to keep traders pecking away at Yara’s shares for a while yet.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
13;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2014-10-17T06:46:09Z;Yara and CF call off $27bn merger plan;Questions raised over conduct of Yara’s board in failed tie-up;Yara International and CF Industries of the US have called off their $27bn merger talks, leaving the Norwegian company’s reputation in tatters after it lost its two leaders over the deal.Questions will be raised over the conduct of Yara’s board following its decision to fire its chief executive, shortly after losing his proposed replacement, all over a tie-up that has failed to materialise.CF said early on Friday that despite identifying significant cost savings the two fertiliser companies were not able to propose a deal to the satisfaction of “all our respective shareholders”.That hinted at a problem in the stance of the main shareholder in Yara, the Norwegian government, which holds a 36 per cent stake.The government is unable to reduce its stake to below 34 per cent without parliamentary support, which the centre-right minority coalition does not necessarily have on ownership questions.Reports suggested that its desire to maintain its stake and keep the headquarters in Norway, combined with CF’s belief that it should have a bigger share of the merger due to its higher revenues, led to the deal’s collapse.Leif Teksum, Yara’s chairman, played down fears about the Norwegian government’s stance to the Financial Times last week, saying that he could convince politicians if the deal was compelling enough.Yara last week ousted Jørgen Ole Haslestad as chief executive after determining that the manager, due to retire early next year, was not the right person to lead the merger discussions.That followed the decision 10 days earlier of Svein Richard Brandtzaeg, who was due to replace Mr Haslestad in the new year, to withdraw his candidature, blaming in part his lack of knowledge of the merger talks. Mr Brandtzaeg will remain chief executive of Hydro, the Norwegian aluminium company.Merger advisers not involved in the deal had already been critical of Yara’s conduct. “It looks a complete mess. To lose one chief executive may look unfortunate but to lose two is careless and reflects poorly on the board,” said one London-based adviser.The deal would have created the world’s largest producer of nitrogen, a crucial crop nutrient, with a combined market capitalisation of $27bn and joint sales last year of $20bn.Norwegian commentators had already compared the goings on at Yara, whose former chief executive Thorleif Enger is facing bribery charges that he denies, as a soap opera. Mr Teksum said last week: “I can see that from the outside it looks a bit chaotic, but I still believe that it’s not as chaotic inside as it may appear from the outside.”
14;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2014-10-07T15:55:41Z;Yara ousts chief amid $27bn merger talks with CF;Chairman of Norwegian fertiliser company rejects image of chaos;Norwegian fertiliser company Yara International has ousted its chief executive in the midst of $27bn merger talks with CF Industries of the US and just a week after his supposed replacement walked away.Yara, in which the Norwegian government has a stake of more than a third, has been through a chaotic period following a corruption probe that led to its ex-chief executive facing criminal charges and then the leaking of early stage merger discussions with CF.That disclosure led Svein Richard Brandtzaeg 10 days ago to reverse his decision to leave aluminium company Hydro to take over as Yara chief executive by February.On Tuesday, Yara fired Jørgen Ole Haslestad as chief executive and replaced him on an acting basis with chief financial officer Torgeir Kvidal in a move some Norwegian commentators dubbed as akin to the plot of a soap opera.Leif Teksum, chairman, said he wanted a chief executive to lead the merger talks with CF who could have a job in the combined company. As Mr Haslestad was due to retire by February the board decided to oust him now.“I can see that from the outside it looks a bit chaotic, but I still believe that it’s not as chaotic inside as it may appear from the outside,” he said.A combination of Yara and CF would create the world’s largest producer of nitrogen, an essential crop nutrient, with a combined market capitalisation of about $27bn and total sales last year of about $20bn.Mr Teksum said talks were still at an early stage as “we have not come very far in the discussions”.One potential problem is the Norwegian government’s stake of 36 per cent. The minority coalition would have to ask for parliament’s support to cut the stake to less than 34 per cent and might not have the requisite votes.Mr Teksum played down those fears, saying that first Yara and CF had to discuss whether the deal made sense.But he suggested politicians could be won over if the potential for savings was compelling: “If we can demonstrate that there is a large value creation potential, I also believe that the politicians are interested in looking at that before they make their decision.”Yara has faced heavy criticism from some shareholders over corruption. The company was given the largest fine in Norwegian corporate history in January of NKr295m for paying or agreeing to pay about $12m in bribes from 2004-09.Thorleif Enger, its former chief executive, was charged with corruption in January but denies the charges.
15;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2014-09-25T08:21:15Z;Shale revolution reshaping crop nutrient sector;Cheap natural gas behind Yara and CF $27bn merger talks;The merger talks between fertiliser groups Yara International and CF Industries to create a $27bn agribusiness is another sign of how the shale revolution is changing the face of industry in the US.Both companies are leading producers of nitrogen fertiliser, of which natural gas is a crucial component. The deal comes as US nitrogen crop nutrient producers are enjoying a huge boost in profits thanks to low-cost shale gas.Chicago-based CF reported gross margins of 52 per cent last year in its nitrogen fertiliser division, compared with a 9.4 per cent margin for phosphates.Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen producer by market share, lost out to CF when they were involved in a bidding war for Terra, another US nitrogen fertiliser maker. The Norwegian company, whose presence in North America is not large, also missed out on the shale boom which followed.US-based fertiliser makers are also benefiting from the export ban on crude and the lack of liquefied natural gas facilities that is keeping oil and natural gas prices depressed in the US relative to international prices.So why is CF looking at a tie-up with Yara if it is reaping the benefits of shale?From CF’s point of view the geographic and product diversification that the Norwegian group brings to the table is certainly attractive. Yara has sales operations in more than 150 countries and is especially strong in South America, a growing agricultural market.Analysts at Rabobank, the Dutch lender, say that the US nitrogen fertiliser market is reaching a point of saturation, with new production expected to come online in the next few years.Rabobank also warns that the US nitrogen fertiliser industry may lose its edge when (and if) the price of natural gas starts to increase.“Various factors could put upwards price pressure on natural gas prices in the short to medium term,” says the bank.Disappointing returns on investments in shale exploration, especially if crude oil prices fall further, will lead to a decline in shale drilling, potentially putting upward pressure on natural gas prices. In addition shale gas exports are scheduled to start in the next few years as LNG processing facilities come online, while a rise in domestic demand as coal power plants switch to gas, will also push up prices.In spite of the possible declines in the future profitability for the US nitrogen sector, CF, known as a well-run company with one of the highest profit margins in the sector, is still an attractive partner.Many shareholders tend to question the efficacy of mergers of equals, and in this case, the largest shareholder in the merged group could be the Norwegian government as Oslo, together with a state investment fund, owns 41 per cent of Yara.As such, it would be hardly surprising if CF’s shareholders welcome other suitors looking to buy themselves into the US market to try and break up the negotiations.The Commodities Note is online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times.

18;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2014-09-23T11:13:52Z;Yara in merger talks with CF Industries;;Yara International, the Norwegian fertiliser group, is in talks with US-based CF Industries about a merger of equals, in a move that would create one of the largest international crop nutrient producers.Both companies are leading producers of nitrogen, an essential nutrient for agricultural crops. A merged group would be the world’s largest producer with a market capitalisation of about $27bn and a key player in the $100bn nitrogen market.Yara said that discussions were at an early stage, “and there can be no assurances that these discussions will result in any transaction”.A possible deal could spark further consolidation in the fertiliser industry. The market came under the spotlight following the 2007-08 global food crisis, when prices jumped along with the value of agricultural markets. Crop nutrient prices collapsed during the financial crisis, but in recent years, the industry, especially in the potash sector, has seen some of the hardest-fought merger and acquisition battles.Tim Cheyne, managing director at Integer Research in London, said: “The deal would create by far the biggest nitrogen producer globally. The companies have very little overlap on production so the savings would be mostly on logistics to market.”A transaction with CF will provide Yara with presence in North America, where it only has a handful of operations. Yara and CF locked horns four years ago in the fight to take over Terra, another nitrogen fertiliser company that in the end was won by the US company.The US has since seen the shale revolution reduce costs dramatically for nitrogen producers, as the fertiliser is produced from natural gas. CF’s profit margins are among the best in the industry, but the company has little business outside North America.Analysts are also pointing to prospects of lower profit margins for the region’s producers in the next few years as new operations come on line and costs rise. A tie up with Yara could provide CF with a global network.“The US nitrogen fertiliser market is now reaching a point of saturation, as announced capacities are expected to come online in the next few years,” says Rabobank, the Dutch lender.Yara’s main owner is the Norwegian government, which together with a state investment fund owns 41 per cent of the company.The merger talks come amid a flurry of activity in Norwegian state-owned companies with fish farmer Cermaq attracting a $1.4bn bid from Mitsubishi, property group Entra being lined up for a flotation, and rumours that oil major Statoil could do a deal to dilute government ownership.Yara has been dogged in recent years by a corruption case that led the Norwegian company to be fined NKr295m ($47m), while its former chief executive, Thorleif Enger, is facing criminal charges over the case. Mr Enger denies the charges of corruption.Yara is in the middle of switching chief executives with Svein Richard Brandtzæg, the head of Norsk Hydro – from which the fertiliser company was spun a decade earlier – due to take over by February at the latest.
19;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2013-10-28T17:48:25Z;Mosaic to buy CF Industries phosphates arm for $1.2bn;;US crop nutrients group Mosaic has agreed to pay $1.2bn in cash for the Florida-based assets of rival CF Industries, cementing its position as the world’s biggest phosphates fertiliser producer.The move will give Mosaic more than a tenth of the global phosphate crop nutrients market.It follows Mosaic’s decision this year to invest $1bn alongside Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation to build a Saudi phosphate fertiliser facility.The agreement, which will add 30 cents a share to Mosaic’s 2015 earnings, comes at a time when production capacity in phosphates – which encourages photosynthesis in plants – has been growing rapidly overseas, especially in Morocco and China.A prominent position in the US will help Mosaic in the Brazilian market, one of the key battlegrounds for phosphate-based fertiliser producers. India, the other leading buyer of phosphates, has become the main market for Middle Eastern and north African producers.James Prokopanko, Mosaic’s chief executive, said: “The addition of these new phosphate assets and securing access to long-term ammonia supplies solidifies Mosaic’s position among the largest and best phosphate producers in the world.”Alberto Persona, analyst at consultants CRU International in London, said that the deal with CF would help secure Mosaic’s place in the global phosphate market at a time when demand for food in emerging markets is growing sharply.“[Mosaic] will keep an eye on markets east of Suez through its stake in Ma’aden, and now this deal will allow it to be the biggest player across the Americas,” he said.The deal would give Mosaic more than 11m tonnes in production capacity, more than 10 per cent of the global market, where phosphate product capacity totals 106m tonnes and 16m tonnes in the US, according to CRU. Mosaic said it was hoping to receive regulatory approval for its acquisition in the first half of 2014.It could raise antitrust concerns over the company’s dominant position in the US market, where it already has more than 50 per cent market share. But Mosaic shrugged off such worries saying phosphates were a global market, so should not be judged on one regional market.Mosaic already mines phosphate rock in Florida, and the proximity to CF’s assets mean that the company would save about $500m by not having to build new infrastructure for $1bn. Mosaic said it would invest some $500m to develop phosphate rock reserves and improve existing mines.Mosaic will also pay $200m for CF’s pension liabilities, while the deal also includes a supply agreement, where CF will supply Mosaic with up to 1m tonnes a year of ammonia, a source of nitrogen, another key crop nutrient.The agreement will allow CF to focus on nitrogen-based crop nutrients, which is produced from natural gas. The shale gas revolution has lowered production costs for CF providing a boost for profit margins.Mosaic shares rose slightly to $46.16, while CF shares jumped 5 per cent to $220.29

The S&P 500 financial sector stocks led all other major sector indices, up 5.9 per cent for the week.The KBW Bank Index, which comprises 24 large and regional commercial banks, has risen 8.8 per cent to 49.76 since last Friday. Bank of America was the leading individual bank stock on the index, up about 19 per cent in that period.The bank, which passed the stress tests but said it would not return capital to shareholders on Tuesday, gained another 6 per cent to $9.79 on Friday.Zions Bancorporation, the Utah-based bank, has climbed 17.3 per cent to $22.28 since last Friday as the bank said this week that it planned to repay part of its $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.But not all analysts were convinced that the S&P’s rise could continue into next week. The Bespoke Investment Group said in a note to clients: “While it’s just a number, 1,400 will probably act as psychological resistance in the near term, especially since the S&P 500 is currently two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average.“A market in an uptrend typically trades in overbought territory for long periods but, once it gets to two standard deviations and above, we usually see some sort of pullback, or at least a pause,” it added. “But while we’re expecting some sort of pause in the short term, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects of this market.”JPMorgan was down 0.3 per cent to $44.57 on Friday but has risen more than 8.3 per cent this week after it announced plans to buy back $15bn of its shares and increase its dividend by a fifth. Other major banks – Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo – added more than 6 per cent each on the week, hitting their highest points in the year to date.Goldman Sachs climbed almost 5 per cent this week to $122.93. The investment bank was slightly behind its competitors in gains after a former derivatives trader resigned from the bank and criticised its culture as “toxic”.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 15.4 per cent to below 15.The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.Those fears abated this week as confidence from the banking sector drove markets up.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down slightly to 13,232.55 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down fractionally to 3,055.26. Both indices rose to cyclical highs this week.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, has retreated by 2.4 per cent since crossing the $600 threshold in early trading on Thursday. The iPad maker was 0.3 per cent higher at $585.57. IBM, the information technology company, hit an all-time high on Friday, gaining more than 3 per cent on the week to $206.01. The company has surged since Warren Buffett revealed that he took a stake last November.BlackBerry maker Research In Motion added 6.9 per cent to its gains from Thursday to reach $14.38. The company has recovered some of its losses for the year to date but is still down about 1 per cent.Sears Holdings, parent company of the department store chain, was down 1.1 per cent to $82.55 as it reported that it would close 62 retail stores in the first half of the year to reduce expenses.Fertiliser producers were among the day’s best performers. Mosaic, the potash and concentrated phosphate nutrient maker, climbed 4.1 per cent to $57.51.Vincent Andrews, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he envisioned “a supportive backdrop for agriculture equities”. He added: “February North America potash producer inventory declined for the first time since October 2011 as production cuts were in excess of demand deferral. We expect a very strong US spring and [about a] 10 per cent relief rally as potash sentiment inevitably flip-flops once product inevitably moves in the US.”Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, one of the world’s largest fertiliser producers, rose 7.1 per cent to $45.91. While another fertiliser maker, CF Industries, gained 1.7 per cent to $184.21.
21;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2012-03-15T18:13:28Z;Glencore poised for joint bid for Viterra;;Glencore is in advanced talks with two Canadian companies to launch a joint bid for Viterra, the Toronto-listed grain trader now at the centre of a takeover battle.The London-listed commodities trading house is preparing a bid with Agrium, a fertiliser producer, and Richardson International, a privately owned grain trader. A formal offer is expected as soon as early next week, industry executives said.New York-listed grain traders Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge are also planning to bid for Viterra, industry executives said. However, Cargill, the world’s biggest food commodities trader, does not plan to bid. ADM is seen as the top rival to Glencore, executives said.Glencore’s attempt to expand in agriculture comes as Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive, is trying to merge his trading house with Xstrata, the London-listed miner, to create a $90bn natural resources champion.Viterra said on Thursday it had started a formal sale process, providing potential bidders wanting to carry out due diligence with access to its financial information. The company said it was aware of speculation of interest at C$16 a share, although it said “there can be no assurance that a transaction will occur” or at what price.Viterra shares jumped 9 per cent after the announcement to C$16.07, valuing it at more than $5.5bn. The shares have risen more than 45 per cent since the grain trader disclosed on Friday it had been approached.The price tag would remain a challenge for the bidders because leading shareholders are asking for C$15-C$19. Amit Wadhwaney, at Third Avenue Management, the third-largest shareholder in Viterra, said a deal would be only possible in the “high teens”.The interest on Viterra comes as the lucrative Canadian grain market, one of the largest globally, opens to private sector competition for the first time since the second world war.The end of the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board is set to boost the profitability of the commercial traders. The CWB, with sales of $5.1bn in 2010, has had exclusivity in the marketing of wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservative government introduced legislation late last year to end the monopoly by August.Glencore is planning with its partners to split Viterra into three parts, with the trading house taking the grain business, Agrium buying the retail fertiliser business and Richardson taking over the food processing business.Mr Glasenberg met investors in the US this week and made no secret of his desire to bulk up Glencore’s business in asset-heavy agriculture trading in North America. However, people who met Mr Glasenberg in New York suggested that Glencore had limited interest in retail assets.Glencore would also be likely to sell Viterra’s stake in the Medicine Hat fertiliser complex, the people added, with its partner CF Industries seen as a likely buyer for the stake. Viterra owns 34 per cent of Canadian Fertilizers Limited, which built the Medicine Hat plant in the 1970s, while CF Industries holds 66 per cent.Glencore, Viterra, Bunge, ADM and Cargill declined to comment. Agrium and Richardson did not immediately return calls seeking comment.Additional reporting to Anousha Sakoui in London
22;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2012-03-08T22:50:49Z;Wall St rises on Greek optimism;;US equities continued to recover following losses sustained earlier in the week and shrugging off economic data on Thursday that showed first-time claims for jobless benefits came in above analysts’ estimates.The US labour department reported initial jobless claims rose 8,000 to 362,000 in the week to March 3, higher than analysts’ expectations of about 351,000. Markets will watch Friday’s release of non-farm payroll figures closely.“It's a bullish sign that the S&P 500 has rebounded immediately off the lows this week and volatility [as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index] barely moved above 20,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It suggests the market could test post-crisis highs again.”Cyclical material stocks led the S&P 500 as all main sectors climbed on the day. The benchmark index closed up 1 per cent to 1,365.91 as the materials sector gained 1.6 per cent.Owens-Illinois, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of glass bottles, climbed 4.4 per cent to $23.68.Fertiliser maker CF Industries gained 4 per cent to $183.22.Financial stocks built on gains from Wednesday after reports that investors holding well over three-quarters of Greece’s private debt had agreed to participate in the country’s €206bn debt restructuring.Wells Fargo led the major banks, up 3.3 per cent to $31.40.Morgan Stanley gained 1.6 per cent to $18.18. Bank of America crossed the $8 mark, up 0.5 per cent to $8.06. Online share trading broker Etrade went up by 3 per cent to $9.68.AIG dropped 3.9 per cent to $28.41 after the US Treasury said it planned to sell up to $6.9bn in shares of the insurer rescued by the government during the financial crisis.This is the latest stage of a gradual sell-down of the 77 per cent stake the Treasury still owns in the insurer after the bailout in 2008.AIG said on Wednesday that it would buy back up to $3bn of Treasury shares.Shares in Coach, the luxury leather goods retailer, climbed to an all-time high, rising 4.6 per cent to $76.79, among the top gainers on the S&P 500.The company said its sales continued to gather momentum.American Eagle Outfitters climbed 1.4 per cent to $15.75 as Nomura updated shares in the clothing retailer to “buy” from “hold” on confidence in the company’s new chief executive.Paul Lejuez, retail analyst at Nomura, said: “American Eagle has had its challenges over the past several years, some self-inflicted and some a function of the competitive landscape.“New chief executive Robert Hanson is addressing these challenges with a focus on return on invested capital, and we believe American Eagle can beat consensus earnings per share of $1.06 in [its] 2012 fiscal year.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.6 per cent to 12,907.94.Gains were led by Alcoa as the aluminium manufacturer rose 2.3 per cent to $9.77. Cisco, the world’s largest seller of networking equipment, climbed 1.4 per cent to close at $19.68.McDonald’s was the biggest loser on the Dow, down 3.2 per cent to $96.96, after the company’s like-for-like sales in February fell below analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The world’s largest restaurant chain said severe winter weather in Europe last month was partly to blame for its disappointing figures.The Nasdaq went up 1.2 per cent to 2,970.42 on the day. Apple rose 2.1 per cent to $541.99, as analysts began interpreting the implications of its latest products, including a third-generation iPad, unveiled on Wednesday.Richard Gardner at Citigroup said: “With the addition of so many new features at the same prices as iPad 2, Apple has once again made it nearly impossible for competitors to undercut iPad on price and still earn a profit.While there are cheaper tablets on the market, they do not offer the screen size, screen resolution, ease of use or wealth of apps – both Apple-branded and third party – that iPad does. iPad 3 leaves us convinced that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet market throughout 2012.”The Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks went up 1.5 per cent to 418.36. The index has gained over 3 per cent since Tuesday’s close. Among chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.2 per cent to $7.47, while Intel Corp dropped 0.3 per cent to $26.84.
23;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2012-03-07T22:19:58Z;US stocks recover on jobs news;;US stocks rose on Wednesday as signs of a labour market recovery helped shake off jitters that had sent shares to their worst performance in almost three months.The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,352.64 after ADP, the payroll processor, reported the private sector added 216,000 jobs in February, slightly ahead of expectations. That comes ahead of the official monthly non-farm payroll report on Friday, which will be closely watched by markets.“The fundamentals in the market continue to surprise on the upside and beat expectations. Today’s ADP numbers add to that. There are two drivers in the market, primary are the fundamentals and global risk is a secondary consideration in our forecasts. Clearly, the attention is getting back on the fundamentals where it should be,” said Doug Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management.He added: “We think this market continues to run. Friday’s non-farm payrolls are forecast at 210,000 but are we projecting 280,000.”The S&P 500 index had dropped 1.9 per cent on Monday and Tuesday as global economic growth concerns and Greek debt worries crept back into the markets, taking away investors’ appetite for risk.The US Treasury department late on Wednesday said it would sell $6bn in shares of AIG. Shares of the insurer that was rescued during the financial crisis in 2008 were down 1.2 per cent to $29.45 in after-hours trading.The financial sector led the S&P 500 during the day, closing up 1.3 per cent as Greece inched nearer to a successful debt restructuring agreement with private sector bondholders as a deadline approached. Morgan Stanley, the worst hit among the major banks earlier this week, rose 3.2 per cent to $17.88. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $33.24, Bank of America went up 4 per cent to $8.02 and Goldman Sachs rose 2.4 per cent to $116.40.After having spiked on Tuesday, investor expectations of volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, dropped back below 20. The Vix was down 7.8 per cent to 19.25 points, but still has risen 13 per cent for the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 2,935.69. Apple – now the most owned stock by US mutual funds according to Citigroup – see-sawed throughout the day as Tim Cook, chief executive, unveiled the latest iterations of its popular products, including the iPad. Apple closed up 0.1 per cent at $530.69.Netflix, the video streaming and DVD delivery service, rose by up to 4 per cent after announcing it would enter into partnerships to stream content for cable companies. But the volatile shares in the company were sent down by as much as 4.3 per cent after Apple debuted the latest version of Apple TV in the afternoon. Netflix shares recovered a bit to close down 1.8 per cent at $105.19, as it assured customers that it services would be available on Apple TV.Pandora, the internet radio company, slumped 23.9 per cent to $10.86, erasing nearly all of its gains for the year. The company reported widening fourth-quarter losses compared to the same period a year ago and lowered future earnings guidance to below analyst consensus. Mark Mahaney, an internet analyst at Citi, downgraded the shares to “neutral”.“We initiated [Pandora] with a ‘buy’ last July with the stock at $18. That call clearly hasn’t worked. As a speculative ‘buy’ – with no profitability track record and no near-term profitable outlook – [Pandora] always carried very little margin for error. And now there’s error,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 12,837.78. The earthmover Caterpillar gained 2.2 per cent to $108.28, the third highest riser on the blue-chip index.The consumer goods maker Kraft was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling 1.2 per cent to $37.83 as the company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by Scott Mushkin, analyst at Jefferies.“2012, however, appears to be a year of investment and we expect limited upside for the next two to three quarters until the focus shifts to the post-separation outlook,” he said, adding that he still believed in the company’s longer-term prospects.Cyclical materials stocks recovered slightly, up 0.4 per cent, but have been the hardest hit sector on the S&P 500 this week, having dropped 3.4 per cent. The fertiliser maker CF Industries was up 4.1 per cent at $175.84. Eastman Chemical and Dow Chemical were up 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent to $51.17 and $33.12, respectively.Energy stocks were up 0.6 per cent led by a 7.3 per cent jump in shares of Valero Energy at $27. First Solar continued its losses, falling another 6.6 per cent to $25.80 as a report said the renewable energy company was cutting production at its operations in Germany and Malaysia.The Philadelphia Gold and Silver index was down 0.1 per cent, having fallen 8.3 per cent since Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week disappointed markets with a downbeat statement on the likelihood of a third round of quantitative easing.
24;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2012-03-05T22:01:27Z;US cyclical stocks fall on China warning;;"US equities fell as China cut its growth forecast for the year, weighing on cyclical raw material stocks and miners in particular.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan dropped 3.8 per cent to $40.45, and Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies metallurgical coal to China for manufacturing steel, fell 6 per cent to $16.35. US Steel Corp shed 4.7 per cent to $26.21.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,363.44 as analysts sought to temper pessimism.“This should not have been a surprise for the markets [and] the full report released last night showed [the Chinese] are offering further measures to stimulate their economy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.Stocks had fallen during the morning session on tepid US economic data, as a gauge of factory orders fell for the January period, but recovered slightly in afternoon trading.“This is a continuation of the market needing strong data from the US to show the economy is self-sustaining,” Ms Krosby said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,962.81, as blue-chip material stocks were also hit by China’s growth warning. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, lost 3.6 per cent to $9.87; earthmover Caterpillar shed 2.1 per cent to $110.09; and Dupont fell 1.1 per cent to $50.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,950.48, slipping further from the psychologically important 3,000 benchmark, which it breached intraday for the first time in 11 years last week.Apple shares opened higher, to within $2 of its record high of $548.21 set last week. But the iPad-maker declined 2.2 per cent to $533.16.First Solar was the biggest loser on the S&P, dropping 6.5 per cent to $28.08. The world’s largest maker of thin-film solar panels continued to reel from its disappointing fourth-quarter results released last week, while reports suggested natural gas producers are as likely to benefit from clean energy subsidies as renewable energy companies.WPX Energy climbed 2.8 per cent to $18.33, as analysts speculated that the natural gas producer could be subject to a takeover bid, after its shares sold off, as natural gas prices fell last year.Big bank stocks dropped as attempts continued to secure participation in the planned private sector exchange of Greek debtBank of America was down 2 per cent to $7.97, Morgan Stanley was off 3.1 per cent to $18.48, Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $33.68 and Goldman Sachs was off 1.1 per cent to $119.95.AIG gained 2 per cent to $30.39 on news that it would sell $6bn worth of shares in AIA Group. The insurer, which was bailed out by the US government during the financial crisis, said it expects to use the funds to pay down debt it owes to the US Treasury.Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries fell 5.5 per cent to $177.98 as Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that the company’s comprehensive natural gas price hedging strategy, reduces the potential for the company to benefit from low prices for the commodity this year .“While hedging adds visibility to CF’s margins, it may have left some profit potential on the table with [year to date] average [natural gas] prices near $2.60,” PJ Juvekar told Citigroup clients.Advanced Micro Devices lost 5.2 per cent to $7.07 as the semiconductor manufacturer said it would pay at least $150m to break an exclusivity agreement with one of its clients.Micron Technology also fell 5.2 per cent to $8.20 as the Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks fell 2.6 per cent.Micron, which manufactures dynamic random access memory for computers, had rallied strongly last week after a Japanese rival filed for bankruptcy, raising hopes of consolidation in the sector.Zynga shares fell 4.9 per cent to $13.97, after Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan removed his “buy” recommendation on the stock, after it briefly topped his $15 target last week.“We believe Zynga shares are fairly valued and could be range-bound in the near-term until we see greater clarity around the strength of newer games and their ability to increase both users and payers,” said Mr Anmuth.Groupon, the e-coupon company, dropped 5.6 per cent to $18.13.MetroPCS shares slumped 5.7 per cent to $9.96 as Sanford Bernstein analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on shares in the wireless network.“[The company’s] long term prospects are more pedestrian,” Craig Moffett told clients in a note. “Competition is greater in their core markets than it once was – due partially to the shifts down-market from Sprint and T-Mobile.”Polypore International, the plastics manufacturer of a key lithium battery component for the Chevrolet Volt, dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.91 after reports late Friday said Chevrolet would temporarily suspend production of the electric vehicle.Computer Science Corp rose 2 per cent to $31.93, as the company signed a letter of intent with the UK’s National Health Service, as it attempts to rescue a lucrative contract."
25;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-12-06T21:59:31Z;US stocks steady despite warning on EFSF;;Shares in Darden Restaurants tumbled 12.4 per cent to $41.82, as steep discounts failed to attract customers to its flagship Olive Garden chain in November.Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden, which brings in almost half of Darden’s total sales, fell 5.7 per cent in November, a third straight month of declines, triggering a reappraisal of the stock by analysts.“When concepts lose their resonance with customers it doesn’t come back quickly,” said Rachel Rothman, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial, who had a “buy” recommendation on the stock before Tuesday’s announcement.“Turnrounds generally take not just a few quarters, but over a year,” she added.Restaurant stocks have benefited from solid consumer spending so far this year, and analysts stressed Darden’s woes were company specific, as other consumer discretionary stocks escaped unharmed.Elsewhere, US indices were broadly flat, despite Standard & Poor’s warning that the eurozone’s bail-out mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, could face a rating downgrade, once a review of eurozone sovereigns is complete.The S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,258.47, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,150.13. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,649.56.“The tape doesn’t lie,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “A knock to the EFSF rating had already been discounted by the market. If anything it’s a further catalyst for a positive conclusion to the eurozone summit at the end of the week.”MetroPCS was the standout performer in the S&P 500, gaining 7.8 per cent to $8.87, as Braxton Carter, the mobile phone network’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference that the company was considering bidding for new spectrum to meet the growing demand of a data-hungry customer base.“Store traffic has been very strong for MetroPCS so we expect good gross customer additions for the quarter,” said Kevin Smithen, telecom analyst at Macquarie. “The unknown is what the churn rate is going to be, its impossible to estimate how many customers are leaving.”Rival Sprint Nextel fell 1.5 per cent $2.61, as its wireless network provider Clearwire said it would issue new shares to raise $595m in new capital.Last week Sprint had committed to maintain its 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, meaning it must stump up around $300m of the capital raise.The dilution impact of the new share issuance sent Clearwire shares tumbling to as low as $2.09, but the stock closed up 11.1 per cent to $2.50.“Clearwire shares trade around the probability of bankruptcy, and that has been alleviated incrementally by the funding component,” said David Dixon, telecom analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Fertilisers were among the other big movers, after Norway-based Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertiliser producer, said demand would be strong next year, as high commodity prices provided farmers with an incentive to apply.CF Industries, the second largest nitrogen-based fertiliser company, climbed 4.3 per cent to $146.82. Potash producers Mosaic and PotashCorp were up 3.4 and 3.9 per cent to $53.19 and $43.54 respectively.Yara’s guidance comforted the industry, which has been rocked in recent weeks by fears that the weak rupee would lead Indian farmers to cut back on fertiliser imports or demand price discounts.Petrol refiner Tesoro lost 6.1 per cent to $23.31 after Credit Suisse analysts changed their guidance on the stock to “neutral”.Analyst Edward Westlake remained upbeat on the refining sector, but said other companies such as Marathon Petroleum offered more compelling value.“A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012,” he told clients.Marathon shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.64.Halliburton was rocked by BP’s allegations that the oilfield services company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The stock slipped 3.9 per cent to $35.57.Regional banks took a hit after Deutsche Bank said they may need to cut costs by as much as ten per cent to meet efficiency targets if revenues do not meet targets. SunTrust Banks fell 6.4 per cent to $18.03, Regions Financial declined 3.5 per cent to $4.16 and First Horizon was off 4.4 per cent to $7.43.LinkedIn Corp climbed 4.7 per cent to $73.20 after Morgan Stanley recommended clients buy shares in the professional-networking website, arguing its valuation was compelling, after steep falls in the share price in recent weeks.Eli Lilly climbed 3.9 per cent to $38.86 after Sanford Bernstein analysts said the current valuation assumed “extraordinarily low” expectations for the success of the group’s Alzheimer’s treatments. Tim Anderson, an Sanford Bernstein analyst said Eli’s market capitalisation could double if its latest Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, proved successful.3M climbed 1.5 per cent to $82.13 after the maker of Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes forecast 2012 earnings would be $6.25 to $6.50 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.27.
26;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-12-02T22:58:23Z;US luxury retailers lose some lustre;;"US equities enjoyed their best week since March 2009 but chinks appeared in the emerging market consumer thesis that has given luxury retail stocks strong support so far this year.The S&P 500 closed the week up 7.4 per cent to 1,244.28, after the market surged 4.3 per cent on a Fed-fuelled Wednesday, and held on gains, as the US unemployment rate dipped below 9 per cent for the first time since spring.“The Fed-ECB action to lower borrowing rates for European banks shows officials understand the magnitude of the problem,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.“As long as European news flow improves incrementally, we think this rally can run another 7 or 8 per cent beyond 1,350, as investors refocus on positive domestic data.”Amid the rally, it was a tough week for luxury retailers, whose exposure to emerging market consumers has made them stars in a poor year for equities.Tiffany closed the week down 2.7 per cent to $67.60 after warning of soft fourth quarter sales in Europe and the north-eastern US.Investors took fright, despite continued strong growth in China.""No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high end consumer spending.”Ralph Lauren and Coach both fell on Tiffany’s guidance before recovering to end the week in positive territory, and the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, which normally outperforms in rallies, lagged behind the broad index.Other retail stocks were propelled in different directions as November sales figures revealed winners and losers from the start of holiday shopping on Black Friday.Kohl’s slipped 2.5 per cent to $50.51, after the department store saw same-store sales fall 6.2 per cent compared with November last year, despite opening at midnight on Thanksgiving to draw in Black Friday bargain hunters.That helped rival Ross Stores climb 8.2 per cent to $92.42 on year-on-year same store sales growth of 5 per cent.Elsewhere the rally was strongly cyclical. Metal, mining and energy stocks soared on rising commodity prices, and hopes that monetary easing in China would offer support to the country’s resource-intensive construction industry.Steel stocks performed particularly strongly with Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, rising 28.2 per cent to $24.11, AK Steel Holding rose 16.8 per cent to $8.22 and US Steel climbed 24.9 per cent to $27.81.“The Policy accommodation may support Chinese steel consumption, reducing the chances of oversupply, which would depress prices and hurt US companies,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie.But other analysts said the rally had more to do with trading patterns than fundamentals.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and shorts are buying shares to cover their positions,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.Some energy stocks sat out the rally, as investors remained wary of companies carrying debt.Transocean fell 3.9 per cent to $42.76, after announcing plans to issue 29.9m new shares and raise up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 9.5 per cent, led by Citigroup, which climbed 19.2 per cent to $28.17 and Morgan Stanley, up 17 per cent to $15.52.Hospital owners and medical device manufacturers had a tough day on Friday after Wells Fargo said Medicare carriers in 11 key states will perform pre-payment audits for inpatient hospital linked to certain cardiovascular and orthopaedic conditions from the start of the new year.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 10.7 per cent on Friday to end the week up just 0.2 per cent to $4.18. Device manufacturer St Jude Medical tumbled 7 per cent, to end the week up 3 per cent to $35.83.Western Digital Corporation rose 25.8 per cent to $31.44, hitting levels not seen since flooding forced the hard disk drive manufacturer to close production facilities in Thailand more than a month ago.The company raised its current quarter revenue forecast to at least $1.8bn from a previous maximum of $1.25bn, as supply chain pressure eased.Fertiliser companies underperformed broad markets, as concerns mounted that Indian farmers will import less nutrient.Mosaic and Potash Corporation suffered losses early in the week as Indian farming co-operatives pushed for discounts on potash imports of up to 35 per cent in dollar terms, to reflect rupee weakness.Mosaic ended the week up 3.8 per cent to $51.78 and Potash Corporation up 4 per cent to $42.29.CF Industries, which supplies India with nitrogen-based fertilisers, had fared better earlier in the week, but fell Friday to close the week up just 0.7 per cent to $140.73, as reports suggested Indian orders for urea declined significantly in November compared with October."
27;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-12-01T21:40:41Z;US stocks steady after strong rally;Yahoo rises on renewed takeover rumours;November sales data sent department store stocks spinning in different directions, though analysts were reasonably upbeat about overall trends.Kohl’s led fallers in the S&P 500, down 6.4 per cent to $50.37 after same-store sales came in 6.2 per cent lower than November 2010. It had been expecting a 2 per cent year-on-year rise, after it opened stores at midnight on Thanksgiving to draw in Black Friday discount hunters.Sears Holdings slumped 4.7 per cent to $57.48, on reports of weak Black Friday sales, and claims that its biggest shareholder, an investment fund linked to chairman Edward Lampert, has been selling shares.Discount department store rival Ross Stores climbed 3.6 per cent to $92.28 after year-on-year November same-store sales increased 5 per cent.“We’re still seeing year-on-year growth overall, but the holiday season is shaping up to be very competitive,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.“Companies are discounting to attract traffic, while the cost of inputs like cotton and Chinese wages are rising, and that’s going to continue to eat into gross margins.”Broad US indices dipped slightly, though they held on to most of their gains from a Fed-fuelled Wednesday. The S&P 500 was off 0.2 per cent to 1,2443.59, still up more than 7 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,020.03 but still in positive territory for the year following a 500 point gain on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and rose 0.2 per cent to 2,626.2, helped by Google. Shares in the group rose 2.4 per cent to $613.77. Google was catching up with the market after sitting out Wednesday’s rally, but was also helped by reports it would launch an online shopping service with low delivery costs to rival Amazon’s Prime. That did not stop Amazon gaining 2.6 per cent to 197.35.Fertiliser producers continued to be volatile as the weak rupee increased tension between Indian consumers and North American producers.On Thursday Indian farming co-operatives threatened to cut potash imports after a Russian producer refused to consider discounts.Mosaic shares rose as much as 3 per cent in the morning session on hopes it would resist demands to discount as well. But shares ended flat at $52.77. PotashCorp also pared early gains to close up 0.4 per cent at $43.51.CF Industries rose 5.1 per cent to $146.98, for the best performance in the S&P 500. CF is more active in the nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser markets, where Indian customers have negotiated prices that take account of the weak rupee.Shares in wireless network provider Clearwire rose as much as 25 per cent before closing up 14 per cent at $2.03. Clearwire’s main customer, Sprint Nextel agreed to extend up to $1.6bn in conditional revenues and funding to allow the company to make a $237m interest payment.Sprint initially tumbled on the arrangement, but closed flat at $2.70.Yahoo climbed 3.3 per cent to $16.23 as investors appeared to grow more confident that a $16.50 per share takeover bid led by Silver Lake Partners might end the internet portal’s long-running takeover saga.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, more than any other sector, with investors remaining nervous about bank stocks.Citigroup fell 1.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent to $30.46, as they were named among five banks in a case brought by Massachusetts for foreclosure malpractice.But market watchers were struck by an overall lack of bearish sentiment.According to data from Birinyi and Associates, in the past two years a 3 per cent rally in the S&P 500 has almost invariably been followed by losses in early trading on the next trading day. “What’s interesting about this is that Wednesday’s huge moves haven’t attracted a massive wave of short selling or profit-taking,” Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told clients.Netflix recovered from steep falls against the market on Wednesday, belatedly participating in the rally. Shares in the DVD delivery and video streaming website were up 4.1 per cent to $67.17.Lululemon Athletica fell 5.1 per cent to $47.17. The yoga and athletic clothing retailer disappointed with third-quarter results.Fibre optic maker Finisar slid 12.6 per cent to $16.12 after missing analyst estimates of earnings per share.
28;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-11-17T21:44:11Z;Jefferies sells off on funding concerns;Investors cheered by positive economic data;Jefferies plumbed new year lows on Thursday as bond traders sold the investment bank’s debt. Shares closed down just 2.2. per cent to $10.09 but earlier fell as low as $9.50, the first time the stock has fallen below $10 since November 10, when analysts highlighted the size of the bank’s exposure to eurozone sovereign debt.Jefferies has since taken steps to show its eurozone positions are manageable, halving its exposure in a single morning of trading at one point. But Thursday’s sell-off appeared to be linked to concerns about how the company funds itself.At 4pm, Jefferies’ benchmark bond, expiring in 2018, yielded 856 basis points more than US Treasuries of similar maturities, an increase of the spread by 135bp over the course of the morning, according to MarketAxess data.Better than expected unemployment data – new claims fell to their lowest in seven months– kept the S&P 500 steady in the morning session despite a renewed spike in eurozone bond yields. But just before 12.30pm, the benchmark index tumbled 25 points in a matter of minutes, with traders variously blaming a breach of technical levels or deadlock in Congress’ budget super committee.The S&P 500 closed off 1.7 per cent to 1,216.15, once again dashing bullish investors’ hopes that US markets can break free from eurozone shackles.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent, with investment banks hard hit. Goldman Sachs fell 3.5 per cent to $92.30, and Morgan Stanley was off 3.6 per cent to $14.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 11,770.80, but the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2 per cent to 2,587.99, as poor results from data storage company Netapp weighed on tech stocks.Netapp slumped 12.3 per cent to $35.64 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.But fears of falling demand for storage products hit related stocks, with hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital off 5.8 per cent to to $25.26 and semiconductor supplier SanDisk Corp off 3 per cent to $49.52.Applied Materials fell 7.5 per cent to $11.53, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Stephen Chin at UBS said Applied’s recent acquisition of Varian, another semiconductor manufacturer, could lead to a spike in implanter sales offsetting lower solar and display sales in 2012.Sears Holding Corporation dropped quickly after the bell, as the department store chain announced third-quarter losses, excluding some items, of $2.57 per share, an increase of almost 50 per cent compared to the loss for the same period in 2010.Shares recovered slightly but closed down 4.6 per cent to $65.19.Perry Ellis International saw its market capitalisation fall by more than one-third to $13.70 after it slashed full-year earnings per share guidance to $2 per share, compared to analyst expectations of around $2.50. The fashion retailer blamed heavy spending on promotions, which had not resulted in the expected increase in sales.MeadWestvaco was the stand out performer in the S&P 500, up 5.9 per cent to $29.51 after announcing it will spin off its consumer and office products unit and merge it with ACCO Brands in a transaction valued at about $860m. Shares in ACCO rose 26. 4 per cent to $8.80.CF Industries Holdings fell 10.2 per cent to $149.96, and Mosaic tumbled 7 per cent to $50.76, as falling corn prices raised fears that demand for fertiliser will far.“The perception among investors is that as the price of corn drops farmers cut back on fertiliser use,” said Colin Isaac, chemicals analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Although that does not always turn out to be the case, but fertiliser stocks are highly correlated to the corn price.”AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 5.5 per cent to $1.72, after hitting an 8 year intra day low of $1.63. Bankruptcy fears spiked again, on reports that American did not plan to restart negotiations with its pilot union, and chances recede of a deal to rein in costs.
29;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-09-20T18:47:01Z;Netflix hit by investor confidence;;Netflix shares slumped 9.5 per cent to $130.03 on Tuesday, as the combined impact of a corporate restructuring and an unexpected fall in subscribers continued to weigh on the movie-streaming company.The stock is down 13 per cent this week, after Netflix announced on Monday that it will hive off its physical DVD delivery business into a separate company called Qwikster. Last week shares fell 24 per cent after the company revealed a pricing change introduced in July had cost it 1m new subscribers.“In the long run, it makes sense to separate into two companies because the growth profiles and future prospects of the DVD and streaming businesses are dramatically different,” said Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. “But the brand has been tarnished because they didn’t communicate the pricing change to customers well. We don’t know how much subscriber churn there is going to be as a result.”George Askew, the Netflix analyst at Sitfel Nicolaus, said the company’s decision to set up Qwikster is a first step to selling the DVD delivery business altogether.Netflix’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than half in just over two months, from a share price peak of $304.79 in mid-July.The wider market had a see-saw day. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, but ended the day in negative territory after a late sell off.The benchmark index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,202.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,590.24. But the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 11,408.66.“The S&P 500 has always pared gains on reaching 1,220 during the past month,” said Colin Cieszynski, a market strategist at CMC Markets. “There are a lot of resting sell orders which kick in at that point, so this is a normal technical correction.”Other analysts pointed to investors paring risk ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy announcement tomorrow.Barry Knapp at Barclays Capital suggested financial stocks might sell off in anticipation of “Operation Twist”, an expected move by the Fed to lower long-term interest rates, which would in turn impact on the margins banks can charge on lending.Citigroup fell 2.8 per cent to $26.93 after RBC Capital Markets reduced earnings expectations, citing “lower than expected capital markets revenues and a lower net interest margin [on lending]”.But the worst performing sectors in the S&P 500 were industrials and materials, which fell 1 and 0.7 pe cent respectively, although companies in those sectors would stand to benefit from cheaper long-term loans.CF Industries fell 6.5 per cent to $163.67 and Cliffs Natural Resources 6.4 per cent to $70.60.Defensive stocks, including utilities and healthcare companies, were the best performers.Pharmaceutical company Celgene Corporation rose 7.1 per cent to $65.56 on expected resolution of an ongoing European review of its Revlimid product.Watson Pharmaceuticals gained 3.8 per cent to close at $72.01 on the unexpected approval of its generic Lovenox drug by US regulators.Newmont Mining jumped 5.5 per cent to $69.90 after the gold miner promised to pay out higher dividends with the price of gold at historically high levels.Newmont said it would increase its gold price- linked dividend by 7.5 cents a share for gold prices above $1,700 an ounce and 2.5 cents a share for gold prices above $2,000 an ounce.Advertising group Interpublic was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, up 8.3 per cent to $8.13, in what appeared to be a reaction by statistical traders to a sell-off in the stock on Monday.The stock had fallen more than 5 per cent on Monday and it remains well below its 50-day moving average of $9.45.Apple shares hit an all-time high of $422.86 before slipping back to $413.45, a gain of 0.5 per cent.Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse said emerging markets penetration could result in extra $68bn in sales and $18 in EPS,” for Apple by 2015.“Apple is only at the cusp of unleashing its vast EM potential”, Mr Garcha said in a note to clients.Goodrich Corp, which jumped by 15.8 per cent on Monday on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation was preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer, rose another 4 per cent to $111.82 on conflicting reports of a possible sale price.In US data news, new home construction fell 5 per cent in August to 571,000, according to numbers released on Tuesday.“The further fall in housing starts in August adds to other evidence, such as the recent drop in consumer confidence and fall in mortgage approvals, suggesting that demand for new homes remains close to rock bottom,” said analysts at Capital Economics.“This goes some way to explaining why equity prices of homebuilders have recently fallen by more than the wider market.”But homebuilder stocks took the news in their stride. PulteGroup was up 2.9 per cent to $2.85. Lennar fell 1.1 per cent to $14.31, although it remains in positive territory for the week after it revealed an increase in orders in quarterly results on Monday.
30;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-09-19T16:04:25Z;Shale gas boosts US manufacturing;;The shale gas boom that has transformed the fortunes of energy companies is also giving US manufacturing a shot in the arm.The price of natural gas in the US has been cut in half from three years ago after new drilling techniques uncorked extra output. In Asia, where markets are pegged to oil prices, gas costs three times more.The supply trend has begun to reverse the fortunes of energy-hungry US industries. Factories mothballed as prices broke records in the past decade have begun to reopen and some manufacturers are breaking ground on new plants.Dow Chemical plans to open new US ethylene and propylene plants later this decade, and restart a Louisiana ethylene cracker closed in 2009. Royal Dutch Shell announced a chemical plant in the gas-rich Appalachian mountain region to make ethylene and petrochemicals. Sasol of South Africa last week unveiled a plan to convert gas into diesel fuel in Louisiana.In the fertiliser industry, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan is investing $158m to restart a Louisiana anhydrous ammonia plant shut in 2003, when gas prices were climbing. Aluminium company Ormet is dusting off a nearby plant shuttered in 2006.“When the price of gas comes down, it certainly ripples through our economy,” says Mike Eades, president of the economic development corporation in Ascension parish, near the PotashCorp and Ormet facilities in Louisiana.The investments come as the US gas market faces regulatory challenges. Extracting gas from shale rocks involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressures thousands of feet underground, raising concerns it will pollute drinking water. Some states have imposed moratoria or restrictions on the technology, while the Environmental Protection Agency is studying potential impacts. A government advisory panel last month urged disclosure of what is in fracturing fluid.The US government has also authorised the first major exports of liquefied US gas, potentially narrowing the gap between cheap domestic and foreign markets. When the first project won preliminary approval in May, an industrial energy consumers’ association objected, saying: “Natural gas is not like other exported products such as manufactured goods.”Cheap gas is no panacea for high US unemployment. Manufacturers employ 9 per cent of the non-farm workforce, and chemicals manufacturing employs only 0.6 per cent, or 781,000 people.The new gas economics are favourable for industries that use a lot of it. Gas is the main input for nitrogen fertiliser, such as urea. North America shut down half its nitrogen production capacity early in the last decade, and imports now satisfy half its demand.Stephen Wilson, chief executive of fertiliser producer CF Industries, says: “For the first time in decades, American manufacturers of nitrogen fertiliser and other energy-intensive products are in a position to contemplate building new plants and hiring new employees if the regulatory environment accommodates it.”Gas is also a key petrochemical feedstock. “It’s probably the single greatest factor for the US petrochemical industry in terms of our competitiveness internationally,” says Cal Dooley, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council.The chemistry council, an industry group, says trends in US thermoplastics exports show a strong correlation with the ratio of oil and gas prices. Outside the US, many producers rely on naphtha, an oil derivative, to make basic chemicals. Companies able to use cheap natural gas liquids have gained an edge as oil trades at a historically high multiple to gas.“Given the forecasts for US natural gas, on the back of abundant shale gas reserves, we feel that gas-based feedstocks will be advantaged over oil-based feedstocks in North America for the foreseeable future,” a Dow spokesman says.New supplies have kept US gas in a narrow trading range between about $4 and $5 per m British thermal units. But the fuel’s history of volatility may give companies cold feet.Nucor, a steelmaker building a $750m factory to convert gas and iron ore pellets into iron in Louisiana, has a novel approach. The company has an agreement with an energy driller whose production will be sold to offset the factory’s gas price risks.“You better have a long-term supply of low-cost natural gas. We’ve been able to achieve that,” John Ferriola, Nucor president, told investors recently.
31;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-08-12T20:54:54Z;US stocks end week on a high note;;US stocks ended an historically volatile week on a high note, paring their losses from Monday’s session, which saw the biggest one-day drop in share prices since 2008.In focus on Friday were retail groups, which gained initially on strong earnings and macroeconomic data. But those gains were cut when the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly sharply, to its lowest in three decades.Nordstrom, which was up as much as 7 per cent at the opening bell, was up 4.6 per cent to $44.27 at midday on Friday. The high-end goods retailer topped earnings forecasts and brought its full-year profits projection back to where it began the year, after lowering it earlier. Polo Ralph Lauren, which reported strong earnings earlier this week, was up 5.5 per cent on Friday to $137.70.Kohl’s, the department store chain, also beat forecasts and opened higher, jumping 5 per cent. However, executives said they “weren’t happy” with their sales, and the stock ended just 0.1 per cent higher on Friday, at $47.54.It was reported on Friday that US headline retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, while June’s increase was revised from 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent, with notable improvements in electronics goods sales that do not simply reflect rising gas and food prices.“The consumer is at the centre of the weak economy debate,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Even a modestly better than expected number provides us with some level of relief.”By the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,178.80, with industrials and consumer groups advancing, but financials declining.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent higher at 11,269.40, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,507.98.The S&P 500, despite extraordinary volatility– the index moved 50 points each session from Monday to Thursday for the first time – lost just 1.8 per cent this week, and the Dow just 1.6 per cent.That pales in comparison with last week’s S&P decline of more than 7 per cent, the market’s worst five days in two years. The index is down 6.3 per cent on the year.But buyers began to emerge as the week wore on. Factors in their favour included resistance to falling below 1,100 points on the S&P 500 index, as well as some timely and unexpected economic data, such as a fall in jobless claims.There were also tempting bargains such as Apple, which at one point fell into “correction” territory, down more than 10 per cent from the year’s peak price. Apple was up 0.9 per cent on the week to $376.99. The biggest gainer on the week, MEMC Electronic Materials, maker of solar panel wafers, was rebounding from its lowest price since the dotcom bust in 2002. It added 17.8 per cent to $6.53.Financial groups were the worst performers of the week, haunted by concerns ranging from a slowing economy to spillover effects from European bank troubles and the impact of near-zero yields on their deposits. The KBW Banks index fell 8.9 per cent on the week, adding to its 10 per cent decline the previous week.Bank of America, fell 12 per cent over the week, bouncing back somewhat from a 20 per cent drop on Monday. It was the worst performer in the Dow, however, and was trading at $7.19 on Friday – below the $8 level for the first time since early 2009.Citigroup fell 10.7 per cent on the week, to $29.85. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were among the better performers, with analysts citing them as potentially better able to weather the storm, falling 4.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.Despite the rout, analysts continued to recommend that investors buy or hold their shares. “We struggle to find the source of another US banking crisis: liquidity is high, capital is high and changes in asset prices are more subdued,” said Brian Foran at Nomura.“The big risk, we believe, is re-rating for limited growth and low rates,” he added, terming it “the ‘Japan-isation’ of US banks.”Stocks that offered dividend yields higher than Treasuries did well on the week. Mortgage-buying real estate investment trusts, which return their cash flows directly to investors, were up for the week. Annaly Capital Management added 2 per cent to $17.88, and Capstead Mortgage rose 5.6 per cent to $12.90.Materials was the only sector to rise this week, up 0.2 per cent, amid expectations that it would benefit from higher commodity prices – which many believe the Fed’s low rates could bring. CF Industries, the fertiliser group, added 14.7 per cent to $168.20 on the week. Newmont Mining, the gold miner, added 5.6 per cent to $57.44.News Corp, the media group headed by Rupert Murdoch, jumped 10.6 per cent on the week to $16.23, after it promised share buy-backs and Mr Murdoch said he would remain in charge. Analysts at Citigroup recommended selling the stock, citing how much it had risen.
32;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-08-11T20:53:32Z;US stocks gain on lower jobless claims;;Stocks continued a historic week of volatility with a sharp upward swing after an unexpected drop in jobless claims eased fears about the US economy.The S&P 500 index was up 4.6 per cent at 1,172.32, and the The Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 3.9 per cent, at 11,141.80. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.7 per cent to 2,492.68.It was the first time that the Dow had swung 400 points in four consecutive sessions, and the first time the S&P 500 had swung 50 points more than four sessions, according to S&P Valuation Research.The banking sector led Thursday’s turnround, which erased the losses on Wednesday, with the KBW Banks index adding 6.1 per cent, and the S&P financial sector up 6.3 per cent.Bank of America, which has seen its share price halved since the beginning of the year, gained 7.1 per cent to $7.25 after a robust defence of the company by its chief executive, plus supportive analyst comments.Citigroup added 6.3 per cent to $30.29. Capital One, which rose even on Wednesday thanks to its announcement of adeal to acquire the US card business of HSBC, added another 7.5 per cent, to $44.14.The sector was boosted by the discussion across Europe of potential short selling bans on banking shares, which some traders believed might relieve some of the pressure on the continent’s banks.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said that the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to low interest rates could shave about 30 per cent off forecast bank earnings in 2012 and 2013.They said that Wells Fargo was among the banks best able to weather a decline in the economy. Wells Fargo’s price-to-book ratio, which fell below 1 on Wednesday, again rose above that level. The other largest banks, including Bank of America and Citi, are still below that level. Wells’ shares were up 6.2 per cent to $24.29.Investment banks were also stronger, after two initial public offerings priced on Wednesday night, suggesting some thawing of capital markets. Goldman Sachs added 7 per cent to $118.10, and Morgan Stanley was up 10.7 per cent to $18.21.A surprise decline in weekly US jobless claims, which fell to 395,000, their lowest weekly level since April, helped turn sentiment round. Though not a main economic indicator, it was welcomed by traders.“In an environment where investors are panicking, their expectations are very low, and this lower bar creates room for surprises,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Technology stocks gained 4.5 per cent just after the opening, thanks to Cisco Systems’ strong gains following an upbeat earnings report in which sales of equipment held up much better than expected. The shares jumped 16 per cent to $15.92.“The doomsday scenario did not unfold and Cisco managed to top expectations and deliver in-line guidance,” said analysts at BMO Capital Markets, who raised their full-year revenue and earnings forecasts.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, however, lowered their price target on the stock to $17 a share. “Fundamental risk remains high, particularly in the federal, Europe and service provider [segments],” they said, citing the end of government stimulus, the eurozone crisis and weak consumer confidence.Apple, the largest company by market capitalisation in the US, returned from 10 per cent “correction” territory reached on Wednesday. It was notable to investors who consider it among the US’s strongest companies. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $373.70, now down just 7.6 per cent on the year.TrimTabs, the investment research firm, said that buying of shares by company insiders was at its highest daily average in August since June 2008, as company executives and owners snapped up discounted shares of their own companies.“This tells you insiders consider valuation is at least fair or cheap at the moment,” said Minyi Chen, vice president at TrimTabs.Closely watched News Corp shares jumped 18 per cent to $16.19 after reporting earnings of 35 cents a share, topping forecasts of 31 cents. Rupert Murdoch, chief executive, also said he would remain at the helm of the company, citing support from his board despite the ongoing scandal involving the company’s newspapers. The company also committed to further share buy-backs.Analysts at Nomura raised their price target from $19 to $20, citing higher profits and a higher multiple, describing the strong earnings as a “collective sigh of relief”.Materials groups that would benefit from rising commodity prices, which some believe could follow the Fed’s move to keep monetary policy ultra-loose until 2013, were also up. CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, added 10.1 per cent to $164.19, extending gains from Wednesday despite the market rout.
33;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
34;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-06-21T21:08:28Z;Techs and materials lead Wall St higher;;US equities gained for the fourth session in a row, helped by manufacturing and technology groups, though conviction in the broader rally remained mixed.Materials shares led gains in the S&P 500 index, rising 2.6 per cent as the dollar weakened. International Paper was up 4.9 per cent, to $28.78. Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 4 per cent to $15.37, finding support after closing below its 200-day average on Monday.Caterpillar, the equipment manufacturer, saw some of the strongest gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, adding 3.3 per cent to $101.39. It is the sharpest two-day rally for Caterpillar since April.Technology shares also broke recent decline trends. Apple and Cisco both saw the biggest gains in three weeks. Apple added 3.2 per cent to $325.30 and crossed back into positive territory for the year.Cisco jumped 2.4 per cent to $15.51, though it is still down more than 20 per cent so far in 2011, leading a broad turn away fromtech groups that are tied to consumers and businesses spending more.“It’s a relief rally for those shares, with trend reversals for Cisco and Apple, which takes up the Nasdaq on its own,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The indices were enjoying a reversal of recent trends, in which smaller growth companies that comprise the Nasdaq were down the most and large, defensive companies in the Dow were showing the biggest gains.But on Tuesday, the Dow was up 0.9 per cent to 12,190.01 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.2 per cent to 2,687.26.However, the internals of the rally were mixed. Volumes were trailing those on the heavy selling days of the past two weeks but the ratio of volumes for advancing shares versus declining shares was among the strongest of recent sessions.The S&P 500 index rallied throughout the morning until it hit 1,295, a key support level, then began paring gains. But the index then closed up 1.2 per cent to 1,295.52. “This is not a barnburner rally by any stretch,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap. “Real money investors are still cutting back exposure and raising cash on the uptrends.”The early focus was on May existing home sales, which exceeded expectations. Mr Polcari said that with Wednesday’s rate decision from the Federal Reserve and Friday’s US gross domestic product figures still to come, traders were unwilling to make a strong move on the data.CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, was up 5.9 per cent to $146.78. Fertiliser groups have been in favour with analysts after Agrium, a Canadian group, on Monday raised its projections for the second quarter, citing strong retail demand.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, added 2.7 per cent to $32.38 after it announced a $5bn share buy-back programme, among the largest so far in 2011.Whole Foods saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P 500 index, adding6.2 per cent to $60.41. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets had upgraded the shares to “outperform”, sending the shares on a two-day gain of nearly 10 per cent. On Tuesday, the chain said it would expand to as many as 1,000 stores.Shares in Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, dropped 4.2 per cent to $43.28 after it said it was ending a $5.3bn contract with Express Scripts, the prescription drug benefit services provider. Jefferies, the investment bank, was up 0.4 per cent to $21.34 after it reported earnings of 39 cents per share in the quarter, matching expectations. Investment banking revenues were a bit stronger than expected, as capital markets rebounded, but fixed income trading was slower than had been hoped.“We are confident that in a better environment Jefferies has solid earnings power,” wrote analysts at Ticonderoga Securities.Tower Bancorp was up 31.6 per cent to $26.80 after Susquehanna Bank said it would buy its fellow regional bank for $343m. Susquehanna shares were down 7.6 per cent to $7.70.American depository receipts of Sino-Forest, the Canada-based Chinese timber group, fell another 28.9 per cent to $1.97 after Paulson & Co, the hedge fund, said it had sold its position in the company. The company has been plagued by accusations from short-sellers that it does not reliably audit its Chinese assets, though it has vigorously denied the charges.X-REF BUYBACKS STORY ON MARKETS
35;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
36;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2011-03-09T23:28:43Z;Wall Street falls amid turmoil in Libya;;Wall Street marked the two-year anniversary of the bull market with a whimper, edging lower on continuing concern over the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and some disappointing earnings forecasts in the technology sector.Technology stocks were shaken after Finisar gave a worse than expected earnings forecast.The maker of fibre-optic cables fell 38.5 per cent to $24.61 after announcing that demand for its product in China was slowing and forecasting a quarterly profit of 31-35 cents a share, short of the expected 48 cents a share.The weak estimate prompted sharp losses in related stocks. JDS Uniphase, another maker of optical communications, was down 16.7 per cent to $21.14, while Oclaro declined 18.6 per cent to $13.53. The technology sector was down 1.4 per cent, one of the worst performing S&P subindexes.The optical communications sector has been volatile in the past few years. JDS Uniphase is up 827 per cent since March 2009. It has put on 46 per cent this year and is one of the biggest gainers on the S&P in the last six months.Finisar is up 999 per cent in two years, and was up 35 per cent this year before Wednesday’s losses.Also weighing on the wider technology sector was Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales, which issued a current-quarter earnings target slightly below estimates, citing slower-than-expected demand for chips used in personal computers. Shares were down 3.1 per cent to $34.74.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1,320.02 as reports that an oil storage facility had been damaged in Libya led energy prices higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,208.55 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,750.03.Many strategists were asking whether the 1.8 per cent losses on the S&P since mid-February due to the elevated oil price was the start of the long-awaited correction in the US markets.“There will be a correction at some point, and this could be it if oil prices continue to march higher,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.Sharper losses on the S&P earlier in the day were pared, however, after economic data showing that US wholesale inventories had risen higher than expected in January.Inventories were up 1.1 per cent to a seasonally-adjusted $436.88bn, its highest since November 2008, which was ahead of the 0.9 per cent increase predicted by economists.Still, the higher oil price dampened risk appetite and weighed on material and industrial stocks on Wall Street.In the materials sector, Cliff Natural Resources was down 5.3 per cent to $91.56 while US Steel declined 3.4 per cent to $53.85.The S&P materials index was down 1.5 per cent.Industrial stocks fell 0.4 per cent with Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, falling 1.7 per cent to $102.36 and Deere, the tractor maker, down 1.9 per cent to $89.82.Elsewhere on Wall Street, fertiliser companies lost ground after Citigroup cut its investment ratings on PotashCorp and Mosaic to “hold” from “buy”. Citigroup’s note said it was “time to harvest profits” from the North American fertiliser companies.Shares in Potash were down 4.2 per cent at $55.82 while Mosaic was 3.3 per cent lower at $78.84.Also in the sector, CF Industries was 1.9 per cent softer at $126.52 while Monsanto declined 3.3 per cent to $69.39.Elsewhere Walgreen, the drugstore chain, agreed to sell its pharmacy benefit management unit to Catalyst Health Solutions for $525m. Shares in Walgreen were up 0.5 per cent to $42.61, while Catalyst Health Solutions added 18.6 per cent $52.80.Suntech Power Holdings, one of the world’s largest solar groups, was up 2.8 per cent to $9.25 after reporting strong fourth-quarter profits. The company earned $383.4m, or $2.02 per American depositary share, in the quarter, up from $44m, or 24 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, was up 1.8 per cent to $41.88 after Barclays raised its investment rating on the stock to “overweight” from “equal weight”.It is now exactly two years since the post-crisis nadir for the S&P 500 when it closed at 676.53. Since then the index is up 95 per cent, led by the autos and components sub-index, which is up 360 per cent from the bottom.S&P 500 stocks have been outperformed, however, by their smaller rivals in the past two years. Both the S&P 400 mid-cap index and the Russell 2000 small-cap index are up about 140 per cent.In the same time period, the FTSE-All World index has more than doubled, while emerging markets have gained some 145 per cent.
37;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-12-30T22:21:47Z;US stocks fall despite positive jobless data;;US energy shares saw a slight lift after BHP Billiton was said to be considering a $90-a-share bid for Anadarko Petroleum, the US-based oil-and-gas explorer.Anadarko shares closed 6.9 per cent higher at $75.59, their highest level since June 2008.Anadarko recently announced the opening of its Ghanaian “Jubilee”field, the first major international expansion for the group, which has substantial assets in US shale.Gas trapped in shale rock in the US has been a sought-after asset this year. As a sector, oil and gas saw the most $1bn or larger deals in 2010, with 65 deals for $220bn globally, according to Dealogic.The market is expected to continue to expand, with some $90bn of oil and gas assets said to be for sale in 2011. Reliance Industries, the Indian energy conglomerate, said it is still seeking expansion in the US.Other independent US shale exploration groups were mixed. Cabot Oil & Gas was up 0.9 per cent, to $37.69, but Denbury Resources was down 1.4 per cent to $19.Energy shares overall were up fractionally at the end of the session, as US indices slipped back from their highest levels since September 2008 in extremely light end-of-year trading volumes.The S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,257.88. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.1 to 11,569.71, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.2 per cent to 2,662.98.Sentiment was softer in spite of a sharp decrease in weekly US jobless claims. Claims fell by 8 per cent, with 388,000 unemployment insurance claims filed for the week ending December 25. The figures were adjusted for the typical jump in holiday hiring.“We would advise taking the result reported today with a very large grain of salt. The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, saw shares rise 2.1 per cent to $24.12, at one point seeing their highest since June 2008.The Chicago region purchasing managers’ index also improved, rising from 62.5 in November to 68.6 for this month. A reading over 60 indicates expansion.Materials groups, closely tied to economic growth, were down only slightly. Alcoa led the Dow, rising 0.5 per cent to $15.21, though AK Steel fell 1 per cent to $16.11. CF Industries, which produces fertiliser, was up 1.4 per cent to $136.67.The financial sector lagged, falling 0.3 per cent. Asset managers were lower on weaker fund sales. Janus Capital Group was down 1.2 per cent to $12.91, and Legg Mason fell 1.7 per cent to $36.17.US investors pulled almost $8bn from municipal bond funds in November, the Investment Company Institute said on Thursday.Consumer credit groups were lower after US mortgage foreclosures were revealed to have risen sharply in the third quarter, up 31 per cent, according to US regulators. That hurts consumers’ willingness to take on debt. American Express was down 0.8 per cent to $42.51, and Discover Financial fell 2.2 per cent to $18.17.Expedia, the travel website, dropped 1.2 per cent to $25.28. The group has been locked in a dispute with American Airlines over whether the carrier will continue to advertise its flights on the site.Sears Holdings was down 0.5 per cent to $74.15 a day, Its shares rose more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after it said it would launch an online film service. Shares in Netflix, the market leader, were down 0.3 per cent to $179.80.Cephalon, the drugmaker, continued to fall after news that it would not seek approval for its jet lag remedy. Its shares fell 0.8 per cent to $62.16.Retailers were mixed as traders judged the post-Christmas holiday season.Gap, the clothing retailer, rose 2.4 per cent to $22.46. Apparel group Limited Brands also added 1.6 per cent, to $31.19.Tiffany & Co, the jeweller, dropped 1.4 per cent to $63.11. GameStop, the video game retailer, and RadioShack both added 2 per cent to $22.95 and $18.82, respectively.
38;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-12-03T22:20:35Z;US stocks edge up despite jobless data;;US stocks edged up in spite of a worse-than-expected non-farm payroll report, as investors chose to focus on the stronger economic data released earlier in the week.The government employment report disappointed as the unemployment rate rose to a seven-month high of 9.8 per cent.Non-farm payrolls rose by 39,000, far below the 150,000 extra jobs that were expected to have been added in November.“If you look at the overall economic data over the last couple of weeks, it’s surpassed consensus fairly consistently,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, citing retail sales and other reports on employment and manufacturing.He said the market might think the data was inaccurate and could be revised later, adding some details of the report were not as bad as the headline figure.“The aggregated hours worked are still up, the wages on a three-month average are still up,” he said.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,224.67 and was higher by 3 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,381.56, up 2.6 per cent over the five days.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.5 per cent higher at 2,577.77 and higher by 2.2 per cent over the week.A separate release showed the US services sector continued to expand but new factory orders fell.The materials sector rose the most in the wider indices.

Zions Bancorp added 1 per cent to $21.29 and Regions Financial rose 0.3 per cent to $6.08.Deals were also in focus. Amazon.com edged lower by 0.5 per cent to $175.68 after it invested $175m in LivingSocial.com, a daily coupon website.There has been increased interest in the surging popularity of discount websites and it was reported earlier in the week that Google was interested in buying the daily discount website Groupon for $5bn-$6bn. Shares in Google nudged up 0.2 per cent to $573.There were two more deals in the energy sector.Chevron edged up 0.5 per cent to $84.89 after it sold an 18 per cent stake in its deepwater Indonesian gasfields to Chinese group Sinopec for $680m.Chevron owned 80 per cent of the project with Italian company Eni and Indonesia’s state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina holding the rest.Walter Energy sealed a $3.25bn deal for Canadian Western Coal in an acquisition that will create a leading metallurgical coal producer.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent lower at 2,518.21 and fell 2.1 per cent over the week.Energy and materials stocks led the fallers as commodity prices dropped. Range Resources lost 3.1 per cent to $42.07, Newmont Mining declined 2.3 per cent to $61.55 and CF Industries fell 6.3 per cent to $119.65.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were lower, with six down more than 1 per cent.But the semiconductor index was a fraction higher after an increase in Intel’s dividend and better results from Nvidia than expected.Intel shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $21.53 after it raised its dividend by 15 per cent to 18 cents per share.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said the company’s strong cash flow and its confidence in the future meant it could return more money to shareholders.Nvidia, which makes chips for computer graphics cards, rose 5.2 per cent to $13.26 after it reported its quarterly earnings. The chipmaker forecast higher sales for the current quarter and said its mobile business will grow significantly in the next year, when tablets and smartphones will use its Tegra chips.“Our Tegra business should be quite large – it’ll be one of our largest businesses over time,” said Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive, who added that it would also increase the company’s gross margins.But the wider technology index continued to fall, down 1.4 per cent.Technology stocks suffered on Thursday after Cisco issued a downbeat outlook, saying that a decline in government spending, especially in US states and in Europe, was hitting sales.Walt Disney shares bounced back after falling when the company accidentally released its quarterly results late in Thursday’s session rather than after the closing bell.The earnings disappointed some investors as income from pay-TV services for ESPN, which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year.But Disney was optimistic, forecasting rising advertising sales, pricing and theme park attendance, which sent shares up 5.1 per cent to $37.75.“While the fourth quarter of 2010 was hard to dissect at best and messy at worst . . . forward trends are robust,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who slightly raised their price target for the company.In retail, JC Penney fell 3.4 per cent to $31.13 after it beat expectations with its quarterly profit, but sales were hit by discounting and the chain’s decision to wind down its “Big Book” catalogue business.In contrast, shares in smaller rival Dillards jumped 9.7 per cent to $30.82 after it reported same-store sales rose 1 per cent in its third quarter.Elsewhere in the consumer discretionary sector, DR Horton, the housebuilder, reported a narrower quarterly loss than expected but said demand was soft after the homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April.

Claims climbed by 19,000 to 479,000 last week, the most since April. Economists had forecast claims would fall to 455,000.Chain stores reported mixed sales figures for July, with 61 per cent missing expectations, 7 per cent in line and 32 per cent beating forecasts. Teen stores suffered from shoppers reluctant to buy before August’s back-to-school discounting season. Wet Seal fell 1.5 per cent to $3.28 and Hot Topic was down 5.1 per cent to $4.99. Also disappointing were drugstore Walgreen, which fell 1.1 per cent to $28.20, and clothing retailer JC Penney, which slid 5.9 per cent to $22.54.But Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy’s beat expectations. Abercrombie and Fitch rose 2 per cent to $39.58 and Macy’s was up 1.3 per cent to $19.69.Also in retail, shares in Limited Brands were weaker by 0.5 per cent to $26.16 in spite of raising its forecasts for second-quarter earnings.Agricultural companies advanced after Russia announced an export ban on grain and grain products because the country is suffering its worst drought in half a century.Archer Daniels Midland rose 5.2 per cent to $30.09, Monsanto increased 4.3 per cent to $61.98 and CF Industries Holdings gained 3.9 per cent to $86.16.In earnings news, News Corporation, owner of the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and Fox News, rose 3.9 per cent to $14.39 after it followed Time Warner and CBS to post quarterly earnings buoyed by an increase in advertising revenue.Reporting after the bell on Wednesday, the media company said it had swung into profit of 33 cents a share compared with a loss of 8 cents a share for the same period the year before, when it took an impairment charge.Clearwire Corporation, the US broadband wireless company majority-owned by Sprint Nextel, fell 5.5 per cent to $6.77 after it announced a quarterly loss of 61 cents per share. Its losses deepened from 38 cents per share a year ago. Revenue of $122.5m missed analysts’ estimates of $131.93m.Regis Corporation, the world’s largest operator of hair salon chains including Vidal Sassoon and Supercuts, said that its board was looking at ways to enhance shareholder value which may include the sale of the company.

41;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-06-03T02:53:45Z;Rothschild to bolster US presence;;Rothschild, the investment bank, is bolstering its senior management in the US as the banking dynasty moves to take advantage of the growing demand for independent advice from companies globally.Jim Lawrence, co-founder of the LEK Partnership, a consulting firm, and most recently chief financial officer of Unilever, will become chief executive of Rothschild North America.He will also become co-head of global investment banking, the first time that role has been based in the US, alongside Nigel Higgins in London and Olivier Pecoux in Paris.Mr Higgins, who earlier this year became the first non-family member to lead the firm in Rothschild’s 212-year history, told the Financial Times that the time was right for a “step change” in the US after almost a decade of gradual expansion.“Over the last couple of years, the market globally has moved ever more towards recognising the benefits of truly independent, high-quality advice from an investment bank with a global footprint,” he said, highlighting the firm’s strength in emerging markets.Rothschild has close to 1,000 investment bankers globally, in more than 35 countries. The 140 bankers in North America currently generate about a fifth of the bank’s revenues.In appointing Mr Lawrence, Rothschild has plumped for a US chief executive with ample corporate experience rather than a traditional Wall Street resumé.After starting his career in management consulting, he held senior executive positions at PepsiCo, Northwest Airlines and General Mills.Mr Lawrence said on Wednesday of his background: “I’ve hired a lot of bankers and had the experience of working with a lot of bankers. I have some understanding of what the competition looks like out there.”He added that he saw a “tremendous opportunity” to leverage the Rothschild brand and build the business in the US.The dynasty traces its roots to 1798, when 21-year-old Nathan Mayer Rothschild arrived in England from Germany to start a textile business.Last year it ranked 14th in providing mergers and acquisitions advice in north America, according to Mergermarket, up from 24th in 2008.Rothschild advised various US government agencies on the bankruptcy of General Motors. It is reportedly advising a special committee of directors at AIG on repayment of the insurance company’s government debts.Other recent mandates include the acquisition of Volvo from Ford Motors by Geely, the Chinese carmaker, and CF Industries’ 14-month, hostile pursuit of Terra Industries.David de Rothschild remains executive chairman in North America and of the global bank. Christopher Lawrence and David Resnick, two of Rothschild’s most senior US bankers, will assume global, client-facing roles within the firm.

February’s blizzards and Toyota’s problems may have hurt vehicle sales, but the rest of the retail picture was strong for the second month in a row,” said Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight. “Today’s data suggest that real consumer spending will rise about 3 per cent in the first quarter, the fastest increase in three years.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,149.99 but up 1 per cent on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 10,624.69 but 0.6 per cent higher on the week. The Nasdaq was flat at 2,367.66 but up 1.8 per cent on the week.“[Thursday’s] warnings about a jump in inflation in China did not scare off the sell side,” said David Allen, director of sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “It continues to be bullish going into next week.”Mr Allen expects the utilities and telecoms sectors to outperform.Acquisitions activity supported the market, with three sizeable deals.Life assurer MetLife rallied 8.2 per cent to $42.11 during the week as it announced its acquisition of AIG’s Alico unit, one of the insurer’s main overseas operations, for $15.5bn. It is AIG’s second divestiture this month.

44;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-03-12T20:21:43Z;CF Industries buys Terra for $4.7bn;;The first battle of the “fertiliser wars” closed on Friday after US-based CF Industries sealed a deal to buy US rival Terra for $4.7bn, only hours after Yara of Norway said it would not increase its $4.1bn offer.In turn, the CF-Terra deal knocked down Agrium of Canada’s more than $5bn hostile bid for CF, closing a year-long bid battle that made the fertiliser business one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street.Industry executives and analysts warned, nonetheless, that the war was not over and predicted that the consolidation of the fragmented sector will continue. The consolidation has gained pace as companies seek size to compete after the arrival in the sector of large mining groups, including Vale of Brazil and BHP Billiton.The battle over Terra, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, is part of a flurry of merger activity in the sector, with deals worth more than $10bn already this year.This is driven by an upward trend in fertiliser prices and a belief that the need to extract greater yields from agricultural land means robust future demand.Stephen R. Wilson, CF chief executive, said the combination of CF and Terra “creates a strong leader in the global fertiliser industry with superior assets”.He said the deal would create annual cost synergies of up to $135m. “Our customers will benefit from expanded availability and flexibility of nitrogen product sourcing as a result of the complementary distribution and manufacturing assets of the two companies.”The transaction is expected to close in about 30 days. The deal was sealed after Yara, the world’s largest fertiliser producer, said it would not improve its merger agreement with Terra.Yara offered $4.1bn in an all-cash bid. CF is offering $4.7bn in a cash and shares bid in which holders of each Terra share will receive $37.15 in cash and 0.0953 of a share of CF Industries.The Norwegian company’s resolution not to enter a bidding war was largely anticipated after it said its bid was “first and final”. The decision reflects Yara’s belief that CF is over-paying, rather than difficulties to raise its bid, people familiar with the company said.Yara shares surged 6.7 per cent as it will now scrap a $2bn-$2.5bn rights issue that it had scheduled for May to finance its bid.Jørgen Ole Haslestad, Yara chief executive, said that the US remained an attractive market.“We will continue to search for opportunities to grow our business in the region,” he said.Yara believes that the fragmented nitrogen fertiliser industry will consolidate further.Morgan Stanley and Rothschild advised CF, while Credit Suisse was Terra’s financial adviser. Citigroup advised Yara.T
45;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-03-04T00:08:01Z;Fertiliser groups to mark rebound;;This year’s spate of merger and acquisition activity in the fertiliser industry is set to continue as companies seek size to compete with the arrival in the sector of miners such as Vale of Brazil and BHP Billiton.The consolidation comes as demand and prices for fertiliser commodities rebound from the industry’s worst year in 2009.“The industry is in recovery mood after last year’s dramatic plunge,” says Oleg Petrov, head of sales at the Belarusian Potash Company, one of the largest exporters of fertilisers.“Demand is coming back.”During the 2007-08 food price crisis, the cost of fertiliser commodities such as urea and potash rose tenfold to above $1,000 a tonne.But last year’s financial woes sent prices back to $300 and dealmaking subsided.As demand recovered and prices climbed above $400-$450 a tonne, easing the difficulty of financing deals, the sector had seen a flurry of deal activity in the first two months of this year totalling almost $10.5bn, according to data from Dealogic.Industry executives believe those acquisitions are just the beginning.The deals include a battle between Yara of Norway, the largest listed fertiliser producer, and US-based CF Industries for control of Terra, a US nitrogen fertiliser producer.They have offered $4.1bn and $4.7bn respectively.Vale has spent $5bn buying fertiliser assets in Brazil, and earlier this year BHP Billiton bought Canada-based Athabasca Potash for $323m.Executives say consolidation is more likely between nitrogen fertiliser suppliers, where fragmentation is greater.“There is a great chance that we see further M&A activity,” says a senior executive from a fertiliser producer.“In the nitrogen sector, for sure.”Another executive from a European based-company adds: “I will be not surprised at all if we see further consolidation this year.”The first candidate is Canada-based Agrium, which is engaged in a hostile bid for CF Industries valued at around $5.5bn.Elena Nadtotchi, at Moody’s, the credit rating agency, in London, says that after deals topping $25bn since May 2008 she expects consolidation to continue in the short to medium term, spreading beyond the nitrogen sector.“This consolidation activity has at first materialised among those industry players with a focus on the relatively fragmented nitrogen fertiliser market,” she says.“However, the entry of large mining groups …could have profound consequences for potash and phosphates industry dynamics.”Executives agree that the biggest catalyst for consolidation is the arrival of the miners.Fortis Bank says fertiliser producers “have never really been put to the test by the kind of cost-cutting competition that BHP Billiton will try to implement”.The miners will face an uphill battle to develop organically because of high costs.A project can cost more than $3bn in potash and about $1bn-$1.5bn in phosphate and nitrogen.Lead times are up to seven years.With those high entry barriers, many expect the miners to buy existing operations, such as medium-sized active producers or small companies with mining rights, to gain size quicker.Beyond the miners, executives say producers such as Yara, Canada’s Potash Corp, UralKali of Russia, K+S of Germany, ICL of Israel, Mosaic and Belaruskali of Belarus will continue to participate in the consolidation.Some executives say that mergers between them are a “real” possibility.But consolidation, even in the nitrogen sector, faces hurdles.In Europe, for example, some of the most attractive assets are part of larger chemical groups, which are unlikely sellers.In the Middle East, governments are likely to oppose regional consolidation, executives add.The outlook is brighter in North America, with buyers attracted by low US natural gas prices.
46;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-03-02T23:37:53Z;CF Industries makes fresh bid for Terra;;CF Industries, the US fertiliser producer, on Tuesday attempted to break up an agreed deal between US rival Terra Industries and Yara International, the Norway-based fertiliser group, launching a $4.7bn cash-and-shares offer for Terra, excluding debt.CF’s move comes just six weeks after the company walked away from its previous hostile offer for Terra, after a year, only to see its target last month agree a $4.1bn cash deal with Yara, the world’s largest listed fertiliser company.The battle over Terra, which produces nitrogen-based fertiliser products, is part of a flurry of merger activity in the sector, with deals worth more than $10bn announced already this year. This is driven by an upwards trend in fertiliser prices and a belief that the need to extract greater yields from agricultural land means robust future demand. These deals include Vale spending nearly $5bn for fertiliser assets in Brazil.CF is itself the subject of a continuing $5.5bn takeover offer from rival Agrium.People familiar with Yara’s thinking suggested the company considered its $4.1bn offer, which was subject to a $123m break fee, to be final.The company is planning a $2bn-$2.5bn rights issue as part of the deal, which the Norwegian government, the group’s largest shareholder, said it would support.The need for an investor vote on Yara’s equity sale, which has yet to take place, may make it harder for the Norwegian group to increase its bid. Under the terms of the original agreement, Yara has five days to match a new offer once it has been deemed superior by Terra.Stephen Wilson, CF chairman and chief executive, wrote in a letter to Terra’s board of directors: “We do not understand how Terra could have entered into an agreement with Yara without giving CF Industries an opportunity to bid on a level playing field.”CF’s offer will be financed through commitments from Morgan Stanley and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.CF’s cash-and-shares offer was worth $47.40 a share, based on CF’s closing price on Monday night, representing a 15 per cent premium to Yara’s $41.1 cash offer.CF’s stock closed down 1 per cent at $106.42 in New York amid concerns that the company would end up overpaying to win Terra.Terra’s board said it was evaluating CF’s proposal.Morgan Stanley and Rothschild are advising CF, while Credit Suisse is advising Terra.

48;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-02-15T19:46:58Z;Yara agrees deal to buy Terra for $4.1bn;;Yara International, the Norway-based fertiliser group, on Monday agreed to buy Terra Industries, its US competitor, for $4.1bn in a further sign of consolidation in the industry.The deal caps a flurry of merger and acquisition activity totalling $10bn, including the latest by Yara, in the fertiliser business since the beginning of the year.The deal values Terra at $41.1 per share and represents a premium of 23.6 per cent compared with Friday’s closing price.Yara’s purchase comes after CF Industries Holdings, a US-based fertiliser producer, last month dropped its year-long hostile bid for Terra arguing it could not raise its offer further to gain Terra’s support. Its last bid attempt in cash and shares valued Terra at about $3.88bn.Yara, the world’s largest listed fertiliser maker, said it would partially finance its all-cash offer with a rights issue of $2-$2.5bn, to which the Norwegian government, the group’s largest shareholder, said it would subscribe.The government owns 36.2 per cent of the shares, and the country’s national insurance fund, which holds 6.6 per cent, has also agreed to subscribe to the issue. Citi, Deutsche Bank and Nordea will underwrite the rest.Yara said it would protect its BBB credit rating. The company said it planned to tap the debt market at a later stage to convert some of the $1.5bn undrawn committed loan agreements into bonds.Jørgen Ole Haslestad, Yara’s chief executive, said the transaction would elevate the Norwegian company to “a truly global leader” in the fertiliser industry, with a 30 per cent market share in the lucrative US and Canadian market.“North America is an area we wanted a stronger foothold,” Mr Haslestad told the Financial Times.“We are seeing an upward trend in fertiliser [prices],” he said, adding fertilisers were turning from a buyers’ into sellers’ market.Although analysts said Yara’s strategy to expand in the US was right, some questioned the all-cash deal and instead favoured a mix of shares and cash. Shares in Yara dropped 6.9 per cent in Oslo to NKr 225.7 valuing the company at $11.1bn.The expected synergies are low – $60m in the first year, according to the company – but Mr Haslestad said the acquisition was based on a long-term view of continued robust demand growth.The drop in US natural gas prices, which many analysts believe is here to stay, will give US domestic producers such as Terra an advantage.“The structural changes over the last years in the global and US gas market . . .have strongly improved the US producers’ cost position,” said Mr Haslestad. The US imports about 50 per cent of its nitrogen fertiliser needs.Natural gas is the main input in nitrogen fertiliser. Yara said Terra’s facilities will produce fertiliser commodity at half the $1,500 per tonne it would cost to build new capacity in energy rich Middle East, where natural gas prices are lower.Terra, with a market capitalisation of $3.3bn, had 2008 revenues of $2.9bn.
49;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2010-01-15T19:42:21Z;Vale in talks to buy Brazil assets of Bunge;;Vale of Brazil, the world’s largest miner of iron ore, is in talks to expand its fertiliser business through the purchase of Bunge assets in Brazil for up to $3.8bn.The move for the US agricultural trader’s Brazilian fertiliser business includes a 42.3 per cent stake in Fosfértil, a fertiliser group, in addition to phosphate mines and production facilities.It comes as Vale attempts to diversify its business away from iron ore. The talks are also the latest sign of growing interest in fertiliser markets, particularly in potash, in spite of low prices and lacklustre demand in key emerging markets. A recovery is expected this year.Agrium, North America’s third-biggest fertiliser producer, late last year sweetened its hostile bid for CF Industries, a rival it has been stalking since last February.CF Industries, meanwhile, this month withdrew its own hostile offer for Terra Industries, another fertiliser producer. Terra is vowing to remain independent.Gilberto Cardoso, mining analyst at Banif in Rio de Janeiro, said it was hard to evaluate the potential value of a Vale deal as Bunge had fertiliser assets other than Fosfértil, where its stake was valued at R$3.6bn ($2bn).Vale and Bunge did not specify what other assets were under negotiation. Bunge added that there was “no assurance that [the negotiations] will result in any transaction”. Both declined further comment.Mr Cardoso said the talks were clearly an aggressive move that made sense in the context of Vale’s increasing diversification over the past few years. “This not only adds assets and reserves, it also adds value to Vale’s existing assets,” he said.Vale already mines potassium, a raw material for fertiliser, and the Fosfértil acquisition would allow it to add value by entering the business of fertiliser production, Mr Cardoso said.Bunge’s willingness to sell its Brazilian fertiliser unit underlines how the agricultural sector continues to struggle as the drop in crop commodities prices and tighter credit force farmers – particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil – to reduce fertiliser consumption.However, some analysts believe that improving economic growth will lead to higher demand and prices for fertilisers in the near term.Bunge is one of the world’s largest traders of agricultural commodities and its earnings have been dragged down over the past year by poor fertiliser markets.The International Fertilizer Industry Association, the trade body, estimates that global fertiliser demand fell by 5.1 per cent in 2008-09, and will enter in “slow recovery” in 2009-10, with an increase in consumption of about 3.6 per cent.Bunge’s shares were up 2.7 per cent in midday trading, while Vale was down 0.8 per cent.

The acquisition of the US natural gas producer includes about $10bn in XTO debt and is the eighth-largest energy deal since records began, according to Thomson Reuters. While XTO shares rose 15.4 per cent to $47.86, Exxon lost 4.3 per cent to $69.69.The S&P 500 closed at its highest level since October last year, climbing 0.7 per cent to 1,114.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,501.05 and the Nasdaq added 1 per cent to 2,212.10.However, Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said investors were still cautious and focusing on the upcoming FOMC meeting this week. “The Fed is not going to raise rates but in their communiqué they will probably be less dovish than they have been. They may need to raise interest rates sooner, rather than later.”Citigroup weighed on the market after announcing it would issue $17.5bn in common stock and $3.5bn in tangible equity units in a move to repay government bail-out funds.The deal will end the loss-sharing agreement between Citi and the US government, putting an end to the pay restrictions that had accompanied the funds.In a similar move, Bank of America sold $18.3bn of shares earlier this month to exit the troubled asset relief programme.Citigroup was down 6.3 per cent at $3.70. After early losses, the financial sector closed 0.6 per cent higher.Elsewhere, Visa rose 4.2 per cent to $84.77 after the stock was raised from “neutral” to “outperform” at Robert W. Baird & Co. Shares in the world’s largest electronic payments network were also buoyed by the company’s impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index.Visa, which has risen more than 60 per cent so far this year, will replace Ciena, the network communications company.

The $7bn takeover deal has been under scrutiny due to competition concerns.The European Commission has until January 27 to clear or block the bid. However, last month, Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software division and one of Oracle’s biggest rivals, told the Financial Times that the acquisition did not raise any significant antitrust issues and was likely to close soon. Oracle shares gained 2.3 per cent to $23.31.Luna Innovations, which makes technology for medical, telecoms, energy and defence companies, soared 61.9 per cent to $2.38 after the group submitted a reorganisation plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The company also settled all claims with Hansen Medical, the medical robotics group.Luna shares had plummeted earlier this year after the company was ordered to pay Hansen about $36m after allegedly misappropriating trade secrets belonging to its rival.Hansen shares also gained 8.6 per cent to $2.90 following the announcement.Terra Industries dropped 2 per cent to $34.58 after the fertiliser producer rejected a $3.9bn takeover bid from rival fertiliser maker CF Industries Holdings.CF boosted its bid earlier this month but Terra said the deal still undervalued the company. Shares in CF, which has itself been trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Agrium, fell 0.3 per cent to $89.75.Shares in Amazon.com fell 2.1 per cent to $131.38 after Barron’s said market expectations for the online retailer may be too high as the stock has more than doubled this year.
51;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-11-05T14:30:10Z;Fertiliser companies;;"Farmers have a nickname for the aroma of a freshly manured field. They call it the smell of money. If only fertiliser companies were so lucky. Results last month from Potash, the world’s biggest producer of essential soil nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous, were typical of the industry in the downturn. The Canadian group’s profits, down 80 per cent, reflected falling shipments, as lower grain prices led farmers to use less fertiliser.Prices fell sharply, too. One year ago, Potash sold nitrogen-containing ammonia for $698 a tonne; last quarter, the same amount fetched an average price of just $228. Lately, though, green shoots have been poking through the loamy topsoil. Nitrogen prices have begun to rebound in the second half. Demand for fertiliser should pick up next year as farmers are forced to replenish fields depleted by the bumper US harvest.Big producers are jockeying to position themselves for recovery. Agrium, North America’s third-biggest, has sweetened its hostile bid for CF Industries, a rival it has been stalking since February. Its $4.5bn offer, which values CF at a 67 per cent premium to its share price before Agrium’s initial approach, looks unlikely to succeed. CF, armed with a poison pill, and itself hunting a smaller rival, has rejected three previous proposals. Its shares fell 8 per cent to $79.52 on Thursday, well below the new $93 per share offer price, in a sign that investors expect more of the same.The temptation to remain independent is understandable. The outsized returns of the commodity boom, when shares of North America’s top producers rose an average of 400 per cent in 18 months, may be over. But the need to feed a growing and more affluent population means the industry’s long-term prospects remain sound. The smell of money can be a powerful narcotic.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter"
52;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-08-05T20:47:53Z;CF Industries to raise Terra offer;;CF Industries said on Wednesday that it was preparing to increase its bid for Terra, its smaller US rival, in the latest move in the battle for control of the North American fertiliser market.In a letter to Iowa-based Terra’s board of directors, CF’s chief executive Stephen Wilson said the company would agree to pay 0.465 shares of CF for each share of Terra, a premium of 35 per cent above the two companies’ exchange ratio prior to the bid. The offer values Terra at roughly $37.25 a share or about $3.7bn, sweetened from its March offer of about $27.50 a share.“The combined company would be a stronger, more competitive player in the global nitrogen fertiliser industry,” said Mr Wilson in a conference call with investors.Terra issued a statement saying its board would consider the latest proposal before the end of the month.Illinois-based CF is also set to return at least $1bn in cash to stockholders of the combined company after the transaction closes and to distribute 5m contingent future shares to CF Industries’ stockholders, which could be converted into common stock if stocks trade at more than $115 per share after the close.CF has also offered to bring some of Terra’s directors onto the board of the combined company, including Mike Bennett, chief executive, who would serve in a senior executive capacity.“It was increasingly clear that the previous CF bid for Terra was going nowhere, so this new deal breathes some new life into the effort,” wrote Mark Connelly, analyst at Sterne Agee. But, he said, shareholders were still unlikely to support the deal.The move comes as CF fights off its own increasingly acrimonious bid for a hostile takeover from Canada’s Agrium. In February, a month after CF launched its initial bid for Terra, and days after its hostile exchange offer, Agrium made its first $3.6bn bid for CF. The bid turned hostile, but less than two thirds of the shares were tendered into the last Agrium offer.CF expects the deal to yield $105m to $135m in annual cost savings and free up cash due to inventory reductions and expects the new bid to satisfy regulatory conditions.Terra’s share price rose 5.51 per cent to $30.44 and CF shares rose 3.4 per cent to $82.74 by the close of trading in New York on Wednesday.
53;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-06-23T21:35:44Z;Agrium to press forward with hostile CF bid;;Agrium, a Canadian fertiliser maker, said on Tuesday that 62 per cent of the stock of US rival CF Industries had been tendered in support of its $3.85bn hostile takeover bid for the company.Based on its ability to win support over a majority of CF’s shares through the tender offer, which had been set to expire on Monday night, Agrium said it would extend its deadline by another month in an effort to generate further backing.But while Agrium said it was ready to meet immediately with CF to execute a binding merger agreement, it was not clear the results of the tender offer would compel such talks.CF has consistently refused Agrium’s entreaties and opted to focus instead on its own hostile takeover bid for Terra Industries, a smaller US fertiliser supplier. It claims Agrium’s offer is an effort to distract its shareholders and scuttle the attempted transaction with Terra.“Contrary to Agrium’s assertions, the tender offer results do not change the facts that Agrium’s offer substantially undervalues CF Industries, our shareholders do not support the price in the offer, and the offer has significant regulatory issues,” said Stephen Wilson, CF’s chief executive.Agrium has little leverage to force a deal because CF has installed a “poison pill” anti-takeover provision that could make a hostile bid all but impossible to execute through a tender offer. Agrium also missed a deadline earlier this year to nominate directors to CF’s board, so it would have to wait until the company’s next annual meeting to launch a proxy context.CF, furthermore, restructured its initial offer for Terra to eliminate a vote by its shareholders on that deal, making it more difficult for CF shareholders to voice their opinions on which deal the company should pursue.Agrium had said it would continue to pressure CF into talks over a deal if a “compelling majority” of CF’s shares were tendered.The offer currently consists of $40 in cash and one common share of Agrium for each share of CF, valuing CF shares at $79.58 as of midday on Tuesday. The shares were trading below that level at $71.58.
54;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-05-11T18:24:33Z;Agrium turns up heat in bid battle for rival CF;;Agrium, a Canadian fertiliser supplier, on Monday stepped up its hostile bid for US rival CF Industries, boosting its offer to about $4.1bn in a complex three-way tussle.After CF made a $2.1bn bid to buy smaller rival Terra Industries in January, Agrium stepped forward with a $3.6bn bid to buy CF instead. All three of the parties have refused to negotiate with each other over the two proposed deals.Agrium raised the cash portion of its bid on Monday and is now willing to pay $40 per share plus one share of Agrium for each share of CF, valuing CF at $85.20 per share as of Friday’s close. CF’s board has said it will review Agrium’s offer.Mike Wilson, Agrium’s chief executive, reached out to CF at the end of last week to request that the companies open a private dialogue, according to people close to the process. CF, which is still focused on luring Terra to the bargaining table, said it was not willing to talk.Dealmakers’ and traders’ opinions remained split over whether Agrium’s move was part of a takeover strategy or an effort to scuttle CF’s attempts to buy Terra.CF believes Agrium’s decision to extend its exchange offer until mid-June, rather than having it expire earlier, is aimed at complicating its bid for Terra. Terra is expected to schedule a meeting of its shareholders as early as the first week of June, though it could choose to delay the event.Agrium, however, has said its offer to buy CF is not subject to financing conditions, as it is based on committed financing from two Canadian banks. It also brought on Goldman Sachs as an additional strategic adviser last week.“It’s preposterous to think that Agrium isn’t serious,” said one person close to the matter.Still, the path to success for either proposed deal is strewn with obstacles. Agrium is relying on CF’s shareholders to rise up against its board of directors and support its takeover proposal over the offer to buy Terra. But CF restructured its original offer for Terra to eliminate a vote by CF’s shareholders, after Terra rejected the bid citing concerns over transaction risk.Without the chance to vote, CF shareholders will have to proactively voice their displeasure to CF’s board if they favour Agrium’s bid. Investors appeared to realise that the situation poses a significant challenge for Agrium.“The market seems to have given it a big yawn today,” said one hedge fund manager, noting that shares of CF had risen only 2 per cent to $75.28 as of mid-afternoon. “There’s no easy roadmap for Agrium to get CF to the table.”CF says a rally in shares of fertiliser stocks supports a higher premium than the one Agrium has offered. Agrium, however, notes that CF is sitting on $17 per share in cash, which has remained static in value despite the market’s float higher.Neither of the proposed deals has received US antitrust clearance, which could drag the battle out further.
55;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-04-22T00:33:57Z;CF Industries fights off Agrium takeover bid;;CF Industries, a US fertiliser maker, claimed victory on Tuesday after an effort by rival Agrium to generate support for its $3.6bn hostile takeover bid recruited votes from a minority of CF’s shareholders.Agrium had launched a campaign asking CF’s shareholders to withhold votes for three of the company’s incumbent board members at its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.About 20 per cent of CF’s shareholders withheld votes, prompting both companies to declare that the results supported their respective positions. However, Agri­um’s campaign had been symbolic, and was not binding on CF. Agrium did not propose a list of alternate nominees to CF’s board.CF, which has rejected Agrium’s bid, continued to claim that Agrium’s offer was aimed at thwarting CF’s own hostile bid for another rival, Terra Industries.“We stand by our reaction to that [Agrium’s] offer, which is that it’s grossly inadequate,” said Stephen Wilson, chief executive of CF, in an interview. “If they were to propose a different offer with increased value, we’d of course consider it like we considered the first two.”A deal to combine either of the two companies would create one of the world’s largest makers of nitrogen fertiliser. Agrium has said it launched the bid for CF because it covets CF’s business alone, not in combination with Terra’s.Canada’s Agrium said it remained committed to acquiring CF, and said Tuesday’s voting result “sends a message” to CF’s board.“We will meet with CF anytime and anywhere to discuss a mutually beneficial transaction for our respective stockholders,” said Mike Wilson, Agrium’s chief. He added that Agrium “would be prepared to increase our offer further if CF can demonstrate additional value”.Mr Wilson said his company would now focus on executing a deal with Terra, which has refused to enter into merger talks. CF proposed an alternative slate of directors in an attempt to eject Terra’s board or coerce it into negotiations.Mr Wilson said that CF’s offer for Terra is “full and fair,” but that he was willing to consider raising it if Terra opened discussions.RiskMetrics, the shareholder advisory group, had recommended that CF’s investors not withhold their votes. Many mutual funds and other institutional investors habitually cast their votes in line with RiskMetrics’ rulings.
56;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-03-16T23:56:56Z;Astellas drops hostile bid for CV Therapeutics;;Astellas, the Japanese drugmaker, capitulated on Monday and dropped its $1.1bn hostile takeover bid for biotechnology company CV Therapeutics rather than bidding against a higher, friendly offer from competitor Gilead Sciences.Astellas is in partnership with CV to market Lexiscan, one of CV’s top-selling cardiovascular drugs, and had been looking to take control of the entire company to fill out its product portfolio and its pipeline of drugs in development.But after repeatedly rejecting Astellas’s advances, CV announced last week that it had agreed to sell itself for $1.4bn to Gilead, a biotech company that develops drugs to treat cancer and a range of viral and infectious diseases.Astellas, which had offered $16 a share, said on Monday that was a “disciplined acquirer and does not see value for Astellas stockholders in CV Therapeutics at the price level of the sale” to Gilead, set at $20 a share.Tokyo-based Astellas said it plans to drop a lawsuit it had filed in Delaware against CV and its directors.Several massive mergers have been struck between global pharmaceuticals companies this year, including Pfizer’s $68bn deal to buy Wyeth and Merck’s $41bn deal to buy Schering-Plough.Recent transactions involving biotech companies, however, have been harder fought, due in part to richer valuations that are based on better prospects for biotech companies’ innovative drug platforms and pipelines.Global drug giants are eager to control biotech assets, but the tough equity markets have not knocked biotech sellers’ expectations down enough to make for easy takeovers.Roche had pressed Genentech over an unsolicited takeover offer since July before Genentech agreed last week to an offer worth $46.8bn, or $95 a share. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s effort last year to buy ImClone, its longstanding partner, failed after ImClone said it deserved a higher bid and eventually secured one from Eli Lilly.Astellas withdrew its offer the same day Canada’s Agrium, a fertiliser maker, launched a $3.3bn hostile exchange offer to buy key US rival CF Industries as part of another three-way takeover battle.But while CV Therapeutics was able to find a suitable “white knight” bidder to top Astellas’s unwanted offer, the affections between CF, Agrium and Terra remain unrequited so far.CF has rejected a bid of about $69 a share from Agrium, a top competitor in the North American crop nutrient business, and has instead raised its own unsolicited bid for smaller rival Terra Industries.
57;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-03-09T19:23:59Z;CF rejects Agrium bid in favour of Terra;;"CF Industries rejected an unsolicited $3.6bn takeover bid on Monday from rival fertiliser maker Agrium, and instead sweetened the terms of its own hostile takeover offer for smaller US rival Terra Industries.CF, one of the top US makers of crop nutrients, received an unwelcome takeover offer from Canada’s Agrium late last month that valued CF at US$72 a share. The offer came in just two days after CF went hostile with a $2.1bn bid for Terra by taking the offer straight to Terra’s shareholders.Stephen Wilson, CF’s chief executive, said on Monday in a brief letter to Agrium’s board that Agrium’s bid would not be in the interests of his company’s shareholders. He called the proposal “grossly inadequate” and “opportunistic”, and said it was a “transparent” attempt to interfere with CF’s proposed acquisition of Terra. Agrium’s bid would require CF to end its takeover bid for Terra.Illinois-based CF tossed Agrium’s offer aside and boosted its bid for Terra, which has rejected CF’s entreaties so far.In a letter to Terra’s board of directors, Mr Wilson said CF would agree to pay between 0.4129 and 0.4539 of a CF share for each Terra share, valuing Terra at about $27.50 a share. The new bid represents a 70 per cent premium to Terra’s share price prior to the offer.Two days prior to Agrium’s bid, CF launched a hostile exchange at a lower offer that valued Terra at about $20 a share, or $2.1bn, based on an exchange ratio of 0.4235 of a CF share for each share of Terra.CF also said it was willing to issue participating preferred stock in order to structure a deal that would not require the approval of its own shareholders. CF said the move, which would skirt New York Stock Exchange requirements, was aimed at quelling Terra’s stated concerns over whether the transaction would pass shareholder
muster.Shares of Terra had fallen 4.4 per cent by midday on Monday to $24.97, putting their value between the value of CF’s first and second takeover offers. Shares of CF rose 1.4 per cent to $61.41.Agrium says its cash and stock bid for CF, if accepted, would create a nitrogen-producing giant and save up to $150m annually. When CF moved to buy Terra, Agrium felt it had to respond in order to secure CF for itself, Michael Wilson, Agrium chief, told the Financial Times.CF said it was still hoping to enter negotiations over a deal with Terra, which would prevent it from having to attempt a takeover through a tender offer or the election of its proposed alternate slate of directors to Terra’s board.CF says that if it merged with Terra, the combined company would be the world’s largest nitrogen producer.It expects that the deal would yield more than $100m in annual cost savings and free up cash due to inventory reductions."
58;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
59;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-02-25T20:11:15Z;Agrium steps up fertiliser fight with CF bid;;Agrium, the Canadian fertiliser and crop protection group, made an unsolicited offer on Wednesday to buy rival CF Industries for US$3.6bn in cash and stock, potentially threatening CF’s own attempt to take over Terra Industries, a smaller competitor.Agrium, which said it held “serious discussions” with CF over a merger before CF’s 2005 initial public offering, offered to pay US$31.70 in cash and one Agrium share for each share of CF.The proposal, which would hand CF shareholders 24 per cent of the combined company, valued CF at US$72 per share. CF said it would evaluate the offer, which Agrium said represented a 42 per cent premium to CF’s 30-day average share price.The offer would require CF to end its takeover bid for Terra, but is not subject to a financing condition. Agrium said it had enough cash and fully underwritten commitments from Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia to pay for the deal.Agrium’s move is an example of the high stakes of attempting a merger in an industry where executives feel they must maintain or boost market share despite the difficult environment.“CF was moving on Terra, and we wanted CF – not CF and Terra, and not Terra,” Michael Wilson, Agrium chief executive, said. He pointed to CF’s strong phosphate, nitrogen and fertiliser distribution assets and said a merger could provide a platform for future deals.“If you’re going to invest in commodities, you need to be countercyclical,” he said.While the timing of Agrium’s bid was tied to CF’s own machinations, he said Agrium would still be in a “very strong financial position” if it completed the deal. Agrium said it was hoping for talks with CF, mimicking entreaties CF has made to Terra over sitting down to negotiate a deal.CF launched a hostile exchange offer for Terra on Monday that aimed to exchange 0.4235 of a CF share for each share of Terra, valuing Terra at about US$2.4bn. A 12.7 per cent rise in CF’s shares after Agrium’s bid boosted the implied value of CF’s offer for Terra to US$26.52 per share. But Terra shares dropped slightly to US$24.75 on concerns that Agrium’s attempt to acquire its suitor would scuttle any potential deal for Terra.Agrium’s move is reminiscent of an unsuccessful attempt by Waste Management to acquire smaller rival Republic.
60;CF;Cf Industries Holdings;2009-01-17T00:44:31Z;Fertiliser-producer launches takeover bid;;One of the US’s biggest fertiliser-producers has launched an unsolicited takeover bid for a smaller rival in an attempt to forge a $2.1bn deal that would create one of the world’s largest nitrogen fertiliser companies.CF Industries, which is based in the Chicago suburbs, offered to buy Terra Industries, headquartered in Iowa, in an all-stock deal that would exchange each Terra share for 0.4235 shares of CF stock. Based on CF’s closing price of $47.23 on Thursday, the offer values Terra stock at $20, a 23 per cent premium over its $16.29 closing price on Thursday.The fertiliser industry – like much of agribusiness – has gone through boom and bust in the past year. Fertiliser prices soared in the first half of last year as the global commodity boom lifted the agricultural sector, but in the past six months prices have fallen sharply, dragging down the shares of companies in the sector. Both CF and Terra’s stock prices have fallen by about 70 per cent in the past six months.CF appears to have ridden the turbulence better than its rival. Terra has idled production at some of its facilities in recent months in an attempt to control inventory levels and working capital. CF, on the other hand, is considering investing $1bn on an ammonia and granulated urea plant in Peru.Companies are still finding it difficult to finance transactions that involve cash in the tough credit environment, which has prompted bankers to forecast an increase in all-stock offers this year, such as the proposal by CF.In markets in which asset prices have cheapened, potential acquirers can argue that offering stock to the target company’s shareholders gives them the chance to ride the market’s recovery back up, rather than accepting a depressed price in cash.Even all-stock deals can require the acquirer to restructure the target company’s debt because they signify a change of control, and some buyers have been searching for ways to keep from triggering those provisions.But the debt markets have thawed slightly in the new year, and dealmakers say that financing and debt restructuring is attainable for modest-sized deals with demonstrable strategic value.Stephen Wilson, CF’s chief, noted in a letter to Terra that the two companies had discussed a merger in the past.Terra said it would “consider and evaluate the proposal and will pursue the course of action that is in the best interests of Terra and its shareholders”.
