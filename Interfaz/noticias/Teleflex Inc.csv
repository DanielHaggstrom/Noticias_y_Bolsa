0;TFX;Teleflex Inc;2019-01-15T23:06:16Z;PG&E to depart S&P 500 ahead of bankruptcy filing;;California utility PG&E is departing the S&P 500 as it seeks to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late this month and is no longer eligible for inclusion in the benchmark index.PG&E will be replaced by Teleflex, a Pennsylvania-based designer and manufacturer of single-use medical devices, before the start of trade on Friday, January 18, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.PG&E has said it will enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on or about January 29 as the company faces liabilities as evidence has emerged of its role in the Camp fire in northern California last year, which killed at least 86 people.The company’s shares have tumbled nearly 71 per cent in the first 15 days of the year — with the bulk of that drop occurring on Monday when it declared its intention to file for bankruptcy. The company has seen its market capitalisation drop from $12.3bn at the end of 2018 to $3.6bn as of Tuesday, the smallest of any company on the S&P 500.Typically news of inclusion into the S&P 500 boosts shares as it raises exposure to exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that track the benchmark index’s performance and have to buy the stock to make sure they are properly weighted. Getting the boot has the opposite effect.PG&E shares, which were down 16 per cent during regular trade, tumbled another 7 per cent in after-hours trade. Meanwhile, Teleflex shares were down 0.9 per cent in extended trade.

What about a crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich (the subject of one particularly infamous US patent)? Or a patent for swinging sideways on a swing, or for orange trash bags with jack-o-lantern faces? Or the patent at issue in the Supreme Court case, an accelerator pedal that adjusts electronically to the height of the driver?Countries that issue too many obvious patents hurt innovation by giving lazy inventors a monopoly in areas that ought to be open to competition.Companies, from Microsoft to General Motors, have told the Supreme Court that the US economy is stifled by such indolent inventions; but others, from GE to 3M to Johnson & Johnson are lobbying the justices to stay out of the US patent mess, on the grounds either that they cannot solve the problem of obvious patents – or, if they try, they will do more harm than good.There are corporate, academic and legal titans on both sides of the issue, but most agree on one thing: the case, KSR v Teleflex, which will be argued on November 28, could affect every company that holds any US patent or intends to apply for one.Companies that hold the much-maligned “business method patents” – which are often obvious recreations of old ideas, dressed up as new inventions for the digital age – could be particularly vulnerable.The case before the justices involves a low-tech, relatively straightforward patent (unlike many patent cases these days, which turn on futuristic concepts in biotechnology or software). But it tests a notion that will affect both old world and new world patents: when can an inventor combine two ideas that have been around for a long time, and call it a patentable invention? KSR, the company that brought the appeal to the Supreme Court, is a Canadian auto parts company that supplies adjustable gas pedals for light trucks.It says the Supreme Court answered that question in 1851, when the justices refused to uphold a patent for making clay or porcelain doorknobs, on the grounds that the method for making them was no different from making knobs from wood or metal. It did not take a genius to figure out how to update the process to a new material, the court said: “The improvement is the work of the skilful mechanic, not that of the inventor”.KSR is fighting off a challenge from Teleflex, a Pennsylvania competitor which claims it has a patent that covers KSR’s pedals, which combine the technology of an adjustable pedal with that of an electronic sensor. The top US patent court, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit, sided with Teleflex: it says that to invalidate a patent based on a combination of old inventions, competitors must prove that the idea of combining them was already either in the air or familiar to people who work in that field – which is often difficult to do.Under that standard, KSR says, an inventor could get a patent for combining the technology of the telephone with the idea of confirming reservations, and get a patent for confirming reservations by phone: a patent that would clearly violate the Supreme Court’s test for patentability.The Bush administration, on KSR’s side, says the patent appeals court’s standard is too low and “exacts a heavy cost in the form of unwarranted extension of patent protection to obvious subject matter”. Inventors should have to prove an “extraordinary level of innovation”. A brief from intellectual property law professors puts it even more strongly: “The patenting of obvious extensions of existing technologies has high social costs and is contrary to the constitutional purpose of the patent system” – to foster innovation by balancing property rights for inventors against the creative potential of the public domain.Those on the other side of this debate – including DuPont, Procter & Gamble and others – say the federal patent court’s standard helps prevent the problem of “hindsight bias”: the natural human tendency to think that, once something has been invented, it was always obvious that it would be. Tinkering with the standard now could unleash a “blizzard of litigation”, says Teleflex, and jeopardise millions of patents representing an underlying investment of “many tens of billions of dollars”.That may well be true, but the cost of junk patents is also astronomical. The Supreme Court should rewrite the current lax standard for obviousness. The question is: can it do any better? The US business community needs a clear answer to the toughest question in US patent law.A vague or confusing ruling from the justices could end up doing more harm than good, and cost the US economy, not to mention the US consumer, dearly.FT.com’s New Technology Policy Forum: Patents - to nationalise, or otherwise"
