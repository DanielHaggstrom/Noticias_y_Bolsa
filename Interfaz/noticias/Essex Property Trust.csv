0;ESS;Essex Property Trust;2014-04-02T17:27:22Z;Ameriprise buoyed by hopes of higher rates;;Ameriprise Financial climbed on Wednesday after analysts at Morgan Stanley lifted their rating on the firm to ‘overweight’ on hopes the company’s advice and wealth management business will benefit from “strong margin expansion”.Analyst Nigel Dally established a $135 price target, 17 per cent above the company’s close on Tuesday, on improving earnings potential and margins.“Higher short-term interest rates are expected to be a key driver of margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, and unlike other short-term rate-sensitive financials, investors have yet to incorporate this benefit into Ameriprise’s valuation,” Mr Dally said.The investment bank noted it was becoming increasingly likely the Federal Reserve would increase its benchmark interest rate from 0.25 per cent in the next two years.“Presently, there are close to $20bn of cash balances on which the company is generating little to no spread income,” he noted. “Just moving to a 1 per cent Federal Funds rate would add $160m-$170m to pre-tax earnings.”Shares rose 1.42 per cent to close at $113.45.Urban Outfitters was among the top performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said it had repurchased 4.5m shares since the quarter began, its second largest quarterly buyback over the past four years.“We applaud the use of cash for repurchases, particularly at what we consider to be attractive levels,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said. “This may also signal a shift in attitude toward acquisitions, or at least show they are not looking to do anything big.”The company also disclosed same-store sales in the first quarter are trending lower by a single-digit percentage point, roughly in line with Wall Street forecasts.Analysts believed the figures were underlaid by weakness in the company’s namesake Urban Outfitters brand, while its Free People and Anthropologie stores continued to record brisk comparable sales growth.Shares in Urban Outfitters rose 3.98 per cent to end at $38.11.MannKind shares surged on Wednesday after a regulatory committee recommended approval of its inhalable version of insulin.The drug, Afrezza, won backing from the US Food and Drug Administration’s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee, a key hurdle in the process of coming to market.Afrezza still needs full approval from the FDA and faces investor scepticism after Pfizer’s inhalable insulin Exhubera flopped and was pulled from market in 2007.Nonetheless, MannKind said it was pleased with the approval.“Diabetes is a major health problem in the United States, and we are committed to bring Afrezza to the many patients who might benefit from this novel product,” chief executive Alfred Mann said.MannKind shares rose 74.13 per cent, closing at $7.00.Apollo Education, the owner of the University of Phoenix, tumbled after reporting second quarter sales fell 19 per cent from a year earlier to $679m.The company has suffered from declining enrolments at the University of Phoenix, saying new matriculates fell 16 per cent in the three months to February 28.Shares in Apollo slid 8.82 per cent to end the day at $32.06.Essex Property shares weakened by just under 1 per cent to $172.34 after a broker downgrade to neutral.Analysts at Goldman Sachs lowered their rating on the real estate investment trust, citing its 20 per cent year-to-date advance and expensive valuation following its merger with BRE Properties.“The key negative reaction we have received on Essex is valuation,” analyst Andrew Rosivac said. “The impact of the BRE merger differs by metric. Higher real estate taxes and debt mark-to-market adjustments would make Essex more expensive on implied cap rate and [adjusted funds from operations] multiple.”Overall, US equities saw muted gains on Wednesday as a report from private payroll processor ADP pointed to March payroll gains roughly in line with Wall Street expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.29 per cent to 1,890.90, a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.24 per cent to close at 16,573.00. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 0.2 per cent to 4,276.46.
1;ESS;Essex Property Trust;2011-05-19T09:56:54Z;Liquidnet extends reach into capital markets deals;;Liquidnet, the block trading venue, has landed a role in a $133m secondary share offering, marking its foray into capital markets transactions.While the firm has made its name as one of the few share-trading markets where large blocks are exchanged, it has recently served as a broker on share offerings, where it believes it can use its direct relationship with hundreds of institutions to deliver shares with little market impact.The move represents an evolution for so called “dark pools” that have emerged to deliver large chunks of shares to long-term investors, essentially automating what banks’ sales forces do in equity capital markets deals.Liquidnet sees so-called “ATM” deals, in which shares are sold by a company to investors at current-market prices, as a way to connect companies directly with investors rather than going through the marketing process of building a book with a capital markets banker. That allows deals to be priced quickly, minimising the risk that the market could move ahead of the offering.This week, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Liquidnet secured a role in an at-the-market secondary share offering, by Healthcare Realty Trust, a real-estate investment trust, seeking to raise $133m.Last year Liquidnet was a co-manager in an initial public offering, and in April, distributed shares in a $350m offering by Essex Property Trust, also a REIT.The development is also a critical potential expansion for Liquidnet. At the same time that share-trading volumes are well below the financial crisis peak levels, private equity-owned groups are seeking to raise capital through secondary offerings in high volumes in order to pay off debts accumulated during the credit boom.Steve Greenblatt, head of capital markets at Liquidnet, said that the transactions are essentially a market “sell” order entered into Liquidnet’s market, which include the block-only market, and H20, which sends trades out to other venues.“Banks have to search for liquidity,” he said. “We’ve been matching large buyers with large sellers for a decade, without leaking to the marketplace or moving the market.”Mr Greenblatt said that Liquidnet’s role last year in the IPO, by Fortegra Financial, an insurance products group, that raised $66m, came about through a relationship with Summit Ventures, a private-equity firm that is an investor in Liquidnet and Fortegra.But IPOs, he said, are not expected to be a strength for Liquidnet, because it requires choosing a starting price for shares and marketing companies to investors, outside of Liquidnet’s core strengths.Mona DeFrawi, founder of Equidity, which providers research on companies raising capital to investors, said that was secondaries were a more likely role for automated share distribution.“As a chief executive, I’d want to have a lot more control over my shareholder base, how it’s trading and who’s buying the shares. But for trading of already-issued shares, where it’s not a new formation of capital, this could have its place,” she said.Mr Greenblatt said Liquidnet, which has partnered with Bank of Montreal in its two ATM transactions, has further deals in the pipeline, but acknowledged the business was still in its infancy.“The beginning part is always the hardest. We’re trying to put some notches on our belt,” he said.
2;ESS;Essex Property Trust;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
