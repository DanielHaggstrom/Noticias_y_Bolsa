0;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-01-02T15:05:59Z;Toy industry: doll squalls ;Smiling doll faces belie the aggressive battle between MGA and its rivals;From the Cabbage Patch Kids in the 80s to the Beanie Babies in the 90s, every decade had its defining must-have toy craze. As retailers anxiously tot up their Christmas sales, one collectible doll will be on their minds: L.O.L. Surprise. A smash hit in recent years, early reports hint that December sales were slower than hoped. More important is just how its US-based maker, privately-held MGA Entertainment, has caused disruption in the toy industry. The toy — tiny figurines with gigantic heads that come inside a ball wrapped in layers of plastic — has become an unlikely blockbuster hit since its debut in late 2016. The rise of L.O.L. Surprise — the name stands for Little Outrageous Little Surprise — underscores how the country’s two biggest publicly-listed toymakers, Mattel and Hasbro, have struggled to cope both with demand for electronic devices and social media trends.The appeal of L.O.L. is in its surprise factor. Nobody knows what sits inside each plastic ball until purchase. While collectible mystery toys are hardly new, L.O.L. has successfully hooked on to the “unboxing video” phenomenon of recent years.MGA’s success at selling kids tiny hits of dopamine in opaque plastic balls has turned L.O.L. into a multibillion-dollar franchise. MGA, originator of Bratz dolls, another hit product, says all is well. No surprise there. Eight of the top 10 selling toys in 2018 were L.O.L. dolls, says NPD Group, an industry tracker.All this has been bad news for former market leader Mattel. Revenues from its famous Barbie dolls have only stabilised recently after four difficult years. Mattel’s market value has more than halved since 2016. MGA has made informal offers to buy Mattel but has been rebuffed. Hasbro has fared better since winning the lucrative contract for Disney princess dolls from Mattel. Hasbro would probably not welcome an enlarged MGA.Smiling doll faces belie the aggressive battle between MGA and its rivals. Unless Mattel can get its share price up in the year ahead, it may well become the plaything of MGA.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline
1;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-12-01T05:00:28Z;Hasbro/toy guns: they’ve got a Nerf;Growing competition has put the US toymaker through a tough period but it is firing back;The career of the anxious liberal parent is punctuated with agonising binary choices. Do you delight your scrappy 10-year-old with a Nerf gun on Christmas Day and tacitly endorse militarism and plastic waste? Or do you risk tantrums by giving him a model of an organic farm carved from sustainable rubber wood?Weaponry will be one of the key battlegrounds in the $26bn US toy industry this shopping season. Nerf, owned by US toymaker Hasbro, is the undisputed category leader. Older readers may know Nerf for its squishy footballs and goofy foam ball launchers. For kids of eight and up, the brand is now synonymous with one thing: foam-shooting blasters. These are harmless, even while they channel the spirit of Lt John Rambo.Hasbro does not break out Nerf sales. But they brought in a record $645m for the company in 2017, BMO Capital estimates. That works out to 12 per cent of total Hasbro revenue that year. Prices range from $5 for a small blaster to $200 for motorised models that shoot eight projectiles a second. Copying the razor industry, Nerf seems to make its margin from selling consumables, in the form of foam bullets. Kids have an astonishing talent for losing these. An entry level Nerf blaster can be bought for under $10. A pack of 80 darts will set you back $17.99.The success of Nerf blasters has not gone unnoticed. Among the upstarts, one New Zealand company has succeeded in chipping away at Hasbro’s dominance. Zuru’s range of lower priced X-shot blasters now jostles for shelf space against Nerf. A cottage industry of counterfeit foam bullet makers, meanwhile, is eroding Nerf’s lock on high-priced ammunition.Growing competition meant 2018 ended up being a tough one for Hasbro. Its brands relied heavily on shelf space at now defunct toy store chain Toys R Us. Nerf sales ended up sliding more than a fifth to $500m.Hasbro is firing back. It recently launched a new series of cross-branded blasters modelled after weapons used in popular video games like “Fortnite” and “Overwatch” as well as a line of bargain-priced blasters. It expects Nerf sales to grow again next year.Liberal parents who picked up a Nerf gun or a rival brand of foam shooter for Junior on Black Friday need two other things: spare bullets and post-purchase justifications. The gun will encourage your kid to run around, which is healthy, right? It will foster social play and skills in settling interpersonal conflicts, will it not? Besides, it is really just a bright yellow pop gun.

2;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-10-22T17:01:58Z;Hasbro tumbles as tariff ‘ripple effect’ drags on toy maker;;Hasbro shares were eyeing their biggest sell-off in more than 18 years, after the toy maker said the threat of more tariffs caused retailers to cancel or change orders during the third quarter.Like other companies manufacturing goods in China, Hasbro has been caught in the crossfire of the trade battle between Beijing and the US. Some of the group’s games were hit by tariffs enacted in September, leading Hasbro to increase pricing to offset their impact on margins.The prospect of a new round of tariffs on a range of consumer goods also dragged on Hasbro’s quarterly earnings, which widely missed estimates. In anticipation of the “List 4” tariffs, set to take effect in December, retailers cancelled direct import orders and switched many of those orders to domestic shipments, according to Hasbro. It incurred additional shipping and warehousing expenses as it scrambled to move inventory to the US and keep retailers’ shelves stocked.Hasbro said it was unable to ship all of the orders by the end of the quarter.Brian Goldner, chief executive, said on an earnings call Hasbro prioritised key toy launches, including new Star Wars and Frozen products. “We’re working to catch up in the first weeks of the fourth quarter and while early, we are seeing strong consumer demand for these new initiatives,” he added.“We are working diligently to improve our approach to domestic shipments and still face the prospect of more direct import cancellations and shifts to domestic orders as the December 15 List 4 date approaches for most of our product lines.”The tariffs, which were initially scheduled for September, were delayed by President Donald Trump amid concerns over potential disruptions during the holiday shopping season.Shares in Hasbro dropped more than 15 per cent to $101.62, their lowest level since June. It marked their steepest one-day decline since December 2000.Tariff troubles have hit Hasbro and other toy makers at a time when they have stepped up efforts to expand their presence in media, seeking to develop new films based on their toy franchises and increase sales.Hasbro announced in August it reached a deal to acquire Entertainment One, the company behind the Peppa Pig cartoon, for about $4bn. Entertainment One’s shareholders approved the transaction last week, and the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.In the third period, Hasbro took a $20.9m after-tax charge, or 16 cents a share, due to foreign currency hedging related to the deal.Hasbro booked net earnings of $212.9m, or $1.67 a share, down from $263.9m, or $2.06 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.84, below analysts’ average estimate of $2.21.Net revenue rose to $1.58bn from $1.57bn. Analysts were looking for $1.72bn.
3;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-08-23T14:51:03Z;Hasbro/eOne: bringing home the bacon;Juicy cost savings mean Peppa Pig is likely be an asset to US toymaker;Hasbro is going the whole hog on Peppa Pig. The US toymaker responsible for Nerf guns and Monopoly is paying £3.3bn ($4bn), including debt, to acquire Entertainment One, owner of the popular porcine cartoon character. The 35 per cent premium to the three-month share price average is rich. The new debt it will take on and the shares it will issue may give investors pause for thought. But juicy cost savings mean there are strong reasons to think Peppa will be an asset to Hasbro.The all-cash acquisition makes sense. In an age of screen-obsessed kids, toymakers know big hits on the small and big screens can help fuel sales in the toy aisle. Under chief executive Brian Goldner, Hasbro has been forging closer ties with Hollywood. It inked deals with big studios to make films about the toys that it owns like Transformers. It has also started to produce its own content internally, with cartoon series such as GI Joe Renegades and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.The acquisition of UK-listed Entertainment One will boost Hasbro’s ability to turn toy brands into TV shows or films. The addition of Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, another kids favourite, will make Hasbro an even bigger player in the lucrative children entertainment market. It will also extend Hasbro’s global reach. Peppa Pig generated £90.2m in revenues for Entertainment One last year and has a growing viewership in China. The expected $130m a year in cost savings should also make the deal more palatable. Taxed and capitalised, they total more than $1bn, more than the $747m premium being paid, according to Lex calculations.Instead of costs, Hasbro investors should worry about gatecrashers. With Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia all planning to launch direct-to-consumer streaming video services to compete with Netflix and Amazon, the demand for original content will only intensify. Peppa Pig is an attractive asset. Entertainment One shares surged on Friday to 589.5p, above Hasbro’s offer of 560p, suggesting investors think others may be looking to pig out on Peppa as well.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
4;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-08-22T23:48:34Z;Investors bet on Peppa Pig bidding war after £3.3bn Hasbro offer;Shares in producer Entertainment One surge above level of agreed deal with US toymaker;Shares in the owner of cartoon franchises Peppa Pig and PJ Masks on Friday soared above an agreed offer for the company by US toymaker Hasbro as investors bet that other bidders would enter the fray.Entertainment One accepted a £3.3bn offer from Hasbro late on Thursday. But shares in the London-listed film and television production company surged as much as 39 per cent on Friday to £6.16, far surpassing the £5.60-a-share deal, before trimming their gains to £5.85.The dramatic move in the company’s stock came as analysts and investors speculated that another buyer could emerge as consolidation grips the media world.“Content has become a hot topic for this industry — and in Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, Entertainment One owns two of the most popular children’s programming brands,” said analysts at broker Olivetree Securities. “The market will likely focus on counterbid potential — Hasbro’s proposal should be pretty [clean] to consummate and yet many potential suitors have been linked to Entertainment One over the last few years.”Entertainment One would be the latest UK-listed company to be acquired by a foreign buyer as a pound weakened by fears of a disorderly October Brexit make British assets cheaper.Several high-profile companies have been targeted by overseas acquirers since the Brexit vote three years ago but there has been a new round of acquisitions since Boris Johnson’s arrival at 10 Downing Street sent sterling to its lowest level against the dollar in years.Hasbro’s deal to buy Entertainment One ranks among the highest prices for a British-listed group this year.It comes on the heels of this week’s £4.6bn purchase of the UK’s biggest listed pubs and brewery group Greene King by the investment firm founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, the £4bn buyout of the aerospace and defence supplier Cobham by a US private equity group, and the roughly £5bn takeover of the food delivery company Just Eat by Netherlands-based Takeaway.com.The purchase would add a slate of new brands to Hasbro’s portfolio as the toymaker known for the Monopoly board game and Play-Doh moulding clay seeks to bolster its pre-school business and expand its entertainment offerings.Peppa Pig, which turned 15 this year, is among Entertainment One’s most prized assets. The group said the cartoon generated £90.2m in revenues in the year to March 31, up 20 per cent from a year earlier as Peppa continued to gain traction outside the UK.Brian Goldner, Hasbro chairman and chief executive, said Entertainment One would help his company bring its portfolio of brands “to all screens globally”.Top executives from Entertainment One are expected to join Hasbro, which hopes to cut $130m in costs from the combined group by 2022. Hasbro added that it would move a “significant portion” of Entertainment One’s toy business in-house and would attempt to bolster the profitability of its licensing and merchandising operations.Hasbro said it would finance the all-cash transaction with new debt as well as $1bn-$1.25bn from a sale of stock in the company. Bank of America has agreed to provide a bridge loan to fund the takeover.The US company added that it intended to maintain its quarterly dividend but would suspend share buybacks as it worked to pay off its borrowings for the deal.Shares in Hasbro fell 7 per cent in late-morning trade on Friday to $106.82.
5;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-04-23T16:03:59Z;Hasbro shares eye best day since ‘96 on surprise profit;Revenues boosted by Transformer toys and Magic Card game;Toymaker Hasbro on Monday reported a surprise first-quarter profit and revenues that exceeded forecasts as the success of the Bumblebee movie helped spur sales of its Transformers toys.The Rhode Island-based company behind well-known products like Play-Doh and Monopoly said net revenues jumped 2 per cent from a year ago to $732.5m — the first such increase in six quarters. That topped analysts’ expectations for revenues of $661.3m, according to a Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts.Hasbro shares jumped 15 per cent to $101.39 and were on track for their best day since January 1996.The company said the Bumblebee movie, a spin-off of the Transformers franchise, which released late in December and recently became available for home viewing, drove sales growth at its Transformers brand. “Equally important, it is successfully introducing Transformers to a new generation of kids and re-engaging our core fans around the world,” chief executive Brian Goldner said on the company’s earnings call.Hasbro also noted that its “long-term investments in new platforms provided a meaningful contribution from our digital and e-sports initiative, Magic: The Gathering Arena, as well as growth in Magic: The Gathering tabletop revenues”. Meanwhile, its Monopoly sales have been aided by editions that link to pop culture, like the hit HBO show Game of Thrones and the video game Fortnite.Net earnings were $26.7m, or 21 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $112.5m, or 90 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The prior-year loss reflected expenses including bad debt associated with Toys R Us, severance charges and charges associated with tax reform.Adjusted earnings of 21 cents a share eclipsed forecasts for an 11 cent loss.The company said in February it expected to return to profitability this year and on the company’s earnings call on Tuesday, said “progress is starting to take hold in the second quarter”.The results also showed that Hasbro is recovering from the fallout of the Toys R Us bankruptcy and resulting liquidated inventory in the market.One of the disappointments this quarter was the decline in its partner brand revenue. However, Hasbro said “robust entertainment” for these brands will build through the year with the release of Marvel’s Avengers: Endgame this week, Columbia Pictures’ Spider-Man: Far From Home in July and Star Wars.Hasbro shares were up 8 per cent year-to-date as of Monday’s close following an 11 per cent slide last year.
6;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2019-02-08T12:49:48Z;Hasbro sales sink at end of ‘very disruptive year’ for toy industry;Monopoly board game maker struggles to contend with Toys R Us collapse and European drag;"Hasbro on Friday posted a sharper than expected holiday-quarter revenue drop as the company behind Play-Doh and Monopoly sustained a blow from the Toys R Us bankruptcy and headwinds across Europe.The Rhode Island based-company said fourth quarter net revenues fell 13 per cent from a year ago to $1.39bn, shy of analysts' expectations in a Refinitiv survey of $1.57bn. It marked the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue declines for the toymaker, which pinned some of the weakness on foreign exchange fluctuations.Brian Goldner, chief executive, said 2018 was a “very disruptive year”, thanks to the collapse of Toys R Us, the toy retailer, and “a rapidly shifting consumer and retail landscape”.He added that the company was unable to “recapture as much of the Toys R Us business during the holiday period as we anticipated as the effect of its liquidated inventory in the market was more impactful than we and industry experts expected.”Hasbro shares, which were up 11 per cent year-to-date as of Thursday’s close, dropped nearly 9 per cent in pre-market trade to $82.50.The liquidation of Toys R Us also continued to affect rival Mattel’s results, which also reported a revenue decline at the end of last year. However its results easily topped Wall Street’s expectations as sales were fuelled by stronger demand for Barbie and Hot Wheels.In its franchise brands, Hasbro’s largest division, revenues fell 8 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Its partner brands, which include Star Wars, Marvel and Frozen merchandise, saw sales tumble 20 per cent; similarly sales in its gaming brand fell 22 per cent. However its emerging brands, which includes lines like Lost Kitties, posted a 5 per cent sales increase.Hasbro on Friday also noted European shipments declined as the company faced a changing consumer landscape and reduced inventories amid a declining toy and game market through last year.The company swung to a profit of $8.8m or 7 cents a share in the three months ended December 30, compared with a loss of $5.3m or 4 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items like after tax changes the company reported earnings of $1.33 a share, which fell short of analysts estimates for $1.67.Looking ahead Hasbro struck a more upbeat tone, noting it has entered a fresh innovation cycle this year for its Nerf toys. It also said its Power Rangers line, which it snapped up for $522m last year from its creator Haim Saban, will hit the shelves in the second quarter."
7;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-10-22T11:40:08Z;Hasbro blames Toys ‘R’ Us, strong dollar for poor third quarter;Monopoly maker says 2018 has been ‘very disruptive year’ for toy industry;Hasbro has blamed the bankruptcy of long-term customer Toys ‘R’ Us and the strong dollar for a sharp drop in sales and profits for the third quarter — news that sent its shares down 8.5 per cent in pre-market trading.The company behind Transformers robot toys, My Little Pony, Play-Doh and Monopoly said 2018 has been a “very disruptive year”, with the collapse of Toys ‘R’ Us dealing a serious setback to toymakers who are now forced to find other avenues to sell their products.“The lost Toys ‘R’ Us revenues are impacting many markets around the world, notably the US, Europe, Australia and Asia,” said chairman and chief executive Brian Goldner.For the three months to end of September, revenue came in at $1.57bn, a 12.4 per cent drop from the prior year period and below the $1.7bn the market had forecast. Net income was down 1.8 per cent at $263.8m, confounding expectations for a rise to $282.7m.Sales in the US and Canada were down 7 per cent year-on-year, largely due to the Toys ‘R’ Us liquidation. But they also fell 24 per cent across its other international markets, most notably in Europe and Latin America, as the company was forced to discount to clear inventories in those regions.A sharply stronger dollar also shaved $32m, or 2 per cent off third-quarter revenues, the company said.The disappointing results come ahead of the all-important Christmas shopping season and raises questions over how traditional toymakers will fare this holiday amid these multiple headwinds. Hasbro and rival Mattel have also struggled as children shift their attention to electronic games on tablets and videos on YouTube, and as Amazon cuts into prices.One bright spot in Hasbro’s results on Monday was the company’s entertainment and licensing segment, where revenue jumped by 45 per cent to $84.8m during the period.In an effort to boost sales, particularly in the wake of the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, Hasbro in May struck a $522m deal to buy a suite of media brands including the Power Rangers. The company is also hoping for big wins with toys associated with the film “Frozen 2” and a Power Rangers TV series.
8;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
9;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-07-26T04:00:47Z;Cost impact of tariffs laid bare in corporate earnings;From toys to tools and trucks, manufacturers tweak supply chains and plan price rises;Donald Trump’s multi-front trade battles are prompting warnings from some of the largest US companies that higher tariffs will squeeze their profit margins, force them to pass on the pain to suppliers and push prices up for consumers.An analysis of executives’ comments since the start of the second quarter reporting season shows that most US companies see little immediate impact from the trade actions announced by the Trump administration, most of which have yet to take effect, but makers of toys, tools and trucks have begun to take steps to respond.“This is a very dynamic situation that changes by the day . . . and we’re giving it substantial focus,” Honeywell chairman and chief executive Greg Lewis told analysts. With inflation accelerating in transportation, logistics and metals, the industrial conglomerate was adjusting its pricing “as necessary”, he said, and had begun evaluating “more structural solutions” to weather the tariffs over the longer term, including finding new suppliers.“I think it’s going to be one of those things that goes through into consumer pricing,” cautioned James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola, after the soft drinks group increased prices in response to increases in an array of costs, from freight to the metal used in Coke cans.Whirlpool also told investors it had raised its pricing in response to the “significant headwind” of steel and aluminium tariffs pushing up the cost of raw materials for its washing machines, and companies from Danaher to United Technologies said they were eyeing similar price increases.Stanley Black & Decker said higher prices had so far helped the tool maker fend off the effect of tariffs and unfavourable currency movements, but executives said they may still have to make changes to its supply chain should higher tariffs stay in place for the long term.Companies from 3M to General Electric expressed confidence in their ability to change their sourcing if needed, citing their diversified global supply chains. “Sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what the rules are. But once it’s communicated, we can adapt pretty quickly,” said Scott Roe, chief financial officer of VF, the owner of clothing brands from Vans to The North Face.A few companies have spelt out the tariffs’ likely toll: the White House’s trade measures will cost Ford an estimated $500m-$600m this year, would cost GE $300m-$400m if it had taken no mitigating steps and are forecast to add $45m-$55m to Harley-Davidson’s 2018 costs, executives said.Harley, which last month drew fire from Mr Trump by shifting some production from the US after the EU targeted it in retaliation for US steel and aluminium tariffs, said it planned to keep the prices of its motorbikes unchanged. But that will put pressure on operating profit margins this year, for which it shaved its guidance by half a percentage point, to 9-10 per cent.The warnings come against the backdrop of an unusually strong earnings season for corporate America, despite other challenges including labour shortages, higher transportation costs and currency swings.Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S projects earnings growth of 21.4 for the second quarter, and said on Wednesday that of the nearly 150 S&P 500 companies to have reported so far, 86 per cent had exceeded Wall Street’s expectations — a record since it began collecting the data in 1994.The executives’ comments also represent a striking change of tone from three months ago, when attention focused on calculating the benefits to companies’ bottom lines of the corporate tax cuts Congress passed at the end of 2017.CEOs broadly welcomed the Trump administration’s agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back regulations, but growing fears of a trade war have prompted some to speak up for the principle of free trade in the hope of changing its protectionist trade policy.“We are a company that’s built for fair and open trade,” said John Flannery, chief executive of GE.Brian Goldner, chief executive of Hasbro, put the message more starkly. The toy maker was already moving some production from China to the US, he said, but it was talking to the administration and members of Congress to communicate “just how terrible an impact an ongoing tariff or trade war would be”.

Mattel unveiled a $650m cost-cutting plan last year.News of the job cuts accompanied a 14 per cent drop in second-quarter sales to $840.7m, shy of analyst expectations for $851.8m, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Revenues declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.The company’s net loss widened to $240.9m or 70 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June, compared with a loss of $561.m or 16 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusting for one-off items, the loss of 56 cents a share, was worse than the 30 cent loss that analysts had predicted.Mattel blamed “higher materials costs, higher obsolescence, and unfavourable product mix” for a decrease in its gross margin to 30.1 per cent, down from 41 per cent in the same quarter in 2017.“We are in a turnround and as expected, had a challenging second quarter driven primarily by the Toys “R” Us liquidation,” said new chief executive Ynon Kreiz. “At the same time, we saw continued strong performance by Barbie and Hot Wheels, and we made substantial progress on our structural simplification programme to restore profitability and improve productivity in the near-term.”Mattel has battled to invigorate sales after losing the licence to develop Disney Princess dolls to Hasbro in 2015. Reaction to an overhaul of its Barbie range including the introduction of dolls with various skin tones and body shapes has also been mixed. Adding to the company’s woes has been the Toys R Us’ bankruptcy, which removed a key sales platform for the company.The revolving door in Mattel’s C-suite has been indicative of the challenges in turning round the company. Margo Georgiadis stepped down as chief executive in April after a little more than a year, after cutting the number of brands and overhauling its management team while also pushing to lower costs.Mattel shares fell 9 per cent in after-hours trading to to $14.83.
11;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-07-23T14:05:09Z;Hasbro shares leap after forecast-beating earnings;;Hasbro shares ripped higher by almost 12 per cent in early trade after the toymaker reported earnings that were not as dire as analysts predicted.Still, the recent bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys ‘R’ Us stores worldwide weighed on the company’s revenue, which shrank in the second quarter.Total sales at the Rhode Island company, which is behind Transformers robot toys, My Little Pony, Play-Doh and Monopoly, fell 7 per cent from a year ago to $904.5m in the three months ended June 30. But this sailed past the mean forecast of $833.1m in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Sales in the US and Canada were down 7 per cent year-on-year, largely due to the Toys ‘R’ Us liquidation, but fell 11 per cent across its other international markets, most notably in Europe, as a result of managing inventory in a retail landscape that was evolving quickly.One bright spot was the company’s entertainment and licensing segment revenues, which rose by 26 per cent to $64.7mThe company reported net earnings of $60.3m, or 48 cents a diluted share, which easily topped analysts’ forecasts for 30 cents a share.Shares were 8 per cent higher in early trade on Monday at $101.17, but had been up my as much as 11.8 per cent.Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chairman and chief executive, said the company was investing in innovation, entertainment and a modern global commercial organisation to spur profitable growth in 2019 and beyond. “We are focused on moving beyond the near-term disruption of losing a major customer, with a clear path forward including new retailer activations to meet the consumer demand made available by the Toys ‘R’ Us departure,” he added.Traditional toymakers have been struggling as they vie for the attention of children who are increasingly shifting their interest towards electronic games on mobile devices and videos on YouTube. Hasbro has been doing a bit better than rival Mattel, from which it snatched the licensing rights to Disney dolls in 2014 and thus the revenues from big franchises such as Frozen.In an effort to boost sales, particularly in the wake of the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, Hasbro in May struck a $522m deal to buy a suite of media brands including the Power Rangers.
12;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-05-01T18:22:31Z;Mattel shares power down as Hasbro strikes Saban deal;;Mattel shares were in need of a Lightspeed Rescue on Tuesday as rival Hasbro announced a deal to buy Power Rangers and other media brands from Haim Saban in a $522m cash and stock deal.Mattel shares fell as much as 7.5 per cent to $13.69 before trimming their losses to trade 6 per cent lower and track their worst day since March 9. Mattel shares are volatile and were up more than 4 per cent on Monday.Mattel’s share price moves come as Tuesday’s deal gives rival Hasbro a new brand to grow its portfolio through avenues that have already worked well for it, namely brands with a cache in entertainment. Power Rangers, which started as a television show in 1993, has grown into a global franchise that has spawned movies, action figures and video games. Hasbro had already been named master toy licenser for Power Rangers in February.
13;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-05-01T15:59:50Z;Hasbro buys Power Rangers from Haim Saban;Toymaker pays $522m for brands including billionaire’s spandex-suited superheroes;Hasbro has struck a deal to buy media brands including the Power Rangers for $522m, as the toymaker tries to boost sales after the fallout from the Toys R Us bankruptcy.The Rhode Island-based company is paying about $230m in cash and $270m in stock to Haim Saban, a media billionaire who created Power Rangers 25 years ago. Hasbro will also acquire other Saban brands such as My Pet Monster. Power Rangers, which started in 1993 as a television show about teenagers morphing into colour-coded, spandex-suited superheroes, has grown into a global franchise that generated action figures, video games and three Hollywood films. The TV series still airs in 150 markets on Nickelodeon, the cable channel owned by Viacom. Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chief executive, said that Power Rangers’ “iconic brand” would unleash opportunities in “toys and games, consumer products, digital gaming, and entertainment”. “This is a very positive development for Hasbro”, said Chris Byrne, analyst with TTPM, the trade publication, who estimates Power Rangers made about $170m in toy sales last year and “has been under-exploited as a brand”. The move comes as the toy business has seen better days. Toymakers are struggling with the collapse of Toys R Us, which has shaken the industry and supply chain globally. As Toys R Us winds down operations in the US and UK, toymakers are losing one of their biggest retail clients, weighing on income statements in recent quarters. Traditional toymakers have also struggled as children shift their attention to electronic games on tablets and videos on YouTube, and as Amazon cuts into prices. Hasbro has fared better in the midst of disruption than rival Mattel by diversifying beyond toys and towards movies. Hasbro snatched the licensing rights to Disney dolls from Mattel in 2014, bringing in revenues from blockbuster franchises such as Frozen. Hasbro last week blamed the Toys R Us liquidation for disappointing revenues and a quarterly loss. The company behind Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit said its revenues fell nearly 16 per cent to $716.3m and were about $100m shy of consensus estimates.While warning it would take about a year to work through the disruption from Toys R Us, finance chief Deborah Thomas insisted that its performance was affected by “events that do not reflect the health of our underlying business”.Shares in Hasbro were down about 2 per cent on Tuesday.
14;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-05-01T14:35:14Z;Power Rangers ‘go, go’ to Hasbro for $522m;;It’s Morphin’ time for Hasbro.The US toymaker has on Tuesday struck a deal to buy Power Rangers and several other toy brands from Saban Properties in a cash and stock deal valued at $522m.Created by Saban founder Haim Saban, The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a live action kids television show about a group of teenagers that turn into superheroes. The series, launched in 1993 quickly became a pop culture phenomenon, with the show’s “Go, Go Power Rangers!!!” theme song a fixture in pretty much all households with kids under the age of 10.In addition to Power Rangers, the deal will also see Hasbro acquire My Pet Monster, Popples, Treehouse Detectives and other brands.“We see significant opportunity for Power Rangers across our entire Brand Blueprint, including toys and games, consumer products, digital gaming and entertainment, as well as geographically throughout our global retail footprint,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chairman and chief executive.Hasbro, whose stable of franchises includes “My Little Pony,” “Monopoly” and “The Transformers”, is looking to revive its sales following the bankruptcy of toy retailer Toys R Us last year.The acquisition of the Power Rangers franchise will not only give a boost to Hasbro’s retail toy sales but it should also give a lift to the company’s media production business.In recent years, Hasbro has sought to diversify its revenue away from making toys and action figures by moving into TV and film production. Its entertainment and licensing unit, which is behind the “G.I. Joe Renegades” and “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic” cartoon series, has found success in creating films and television shows about the toys that it owns and markets.The unit made $285.6m last year. While that only accounted for 5 per cent of total group revenue, the division is Hasbo’s fastest growing.(Photo: Getty Images)
15;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-04-23T15:34:02Z;Hasbro shares turn positive as investors digest tough report;;Investors pulled a volte-face on Monday, wiping out early losses in Hasbro shares after the US toymaker blamed the Toys R Us liquidation for disappointing revenues and a quarterly loss but said that the figures did not reflect the health of its underlying business.Hasbro shares tumbled in pre-market trade and were down as much as 4.6 per cent during the early trading session. But they then reversed their losses and were up 2.6 per cent to $84.85 at pixel time as investors digested the quarterly update.The company behind Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit said its revenues fell nearly 16 per cent to $716.3m and were about $100m shy of consensus estimates as a result of the liquidation of Toys R Us in the US and UK and having to clear excess inventory in Europe.Hasbro has turned to partner brands and movies to bolster sales with growth in Marvel revenues. The company called out the success of the Black Panther movie, noting its point of sales are “well ahead of everyone’s expectations”.However, that strength was offset by weakness in franchise brands — the segment most exposed to Toys R Us and that drove the bulk of the miss — which fell 19 per cent from a year ago to $362m.However, the toymaker had previously warned that the liquidation of the 70-year old retailer would be most heavily felt in the first quarter. It still expects to take about a year to work through the disruption from the Toys R Us liquidation.Finance chief Deborah Thomas tried to dismiss the results, saying that its top and bottom lines were affected by “events that do not reflect the health of our underlying business”.She added: “We remain on track to meet our goal of generating $600 to $700 million in operating cash flow this year while investing to build our brands, transform our organisation and return cash to shareholders.”Hasbro “remains the best in class vendor in toys” despite a “tough report”, said Stephanie Wissink, an analyst at Jefferies. She said the ripple effects from Toys R Us’s downfall will be felt across the industry “as retailers slim product flows and vendors hold innovation back until the liquidation period clears”, and continue to “be a meaningful sales headwind”.Traditional toymakers have struggled in the face of increasing competition from online retailers like Amazon and a shift to electronic games on tablets. Mattel in particular has had a difficult time after losing its license to make Disney dolls to Hasbro. Mattel, which last year suspended its dividend, also announced the exit of its fourth chief executive in as many years last week.Hasbro also said it swung to a loss of $112.4m, or 90 cents a share, compared with a profit of $68.6m, or 54 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 10 cents a share were shy of analyst estimates for 33 cents.Hasbro shares are down 7 per cent year-to-date.

Incoming board chairman Ynon Kreiz will take over the top job effective April 26.Separately, Ancestry.com, the company known for tracing family history, said Ms Georgiadis will join the company as its new chief executive on May 10.“Ynon has tremendous expertise across areas critical to our strategy, including digital, media and entertainment, and we have already benefited from that experience and his compelling vision for the company since he became a director,” said outgoing executive chairman Chris Sinclair.Ms Georgiadis’ departure comes as the toymaker has struggled to revive sales. Last year, it suspended its dividend, and rival Hasbro surpassed it in annual sales for the first time since 1993. Mattel also rebuffed a takeover approach from Hasbro.Mattel’s woes can be traced back before Ms Georgiadis’ reign began, having lost the license to develop Disney princess dolls to Hasbro in 2015. Mattel has struggled to lure in new customers despite efforts to overhaul brands like Barbie by introducing dolls in various body shapes and skin tones.Under Ms Georgiadis’s leadership, the company has reduced the number of brands and overhauled its management team while also pushing to lower costs. Still, shares have declined nearly 50 per cent over that period.Mr Kreiz — who has served as a director since June and will become chairman upon his election at the annual shareholder meeting next month — will be Mattel’s fourth chief executive in as many years.“While the company has been facing significant challenges, we have achieved constructive progress in many key areas,” said Mr Kreiz. “I am committed to building on our existing strategy as we continue to aggressively implement our transformation plan.”Mattel shares finished 3 per cent lower on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Ms Georgiadis was in talks to leave the company. However, they rebounded to rise 4 per cent after the market close.Mattel shares are down 13 per cent year-to-date.Read more: Toymakers rethink traditional playbook
17;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-03-15T02:03:15Z;Toys R Us to close or sell all 700 US stores;Retailer plans to file for liquidation, paving way for ‘orderly’ winding down;Toys R Us will shut or sell all its US stores, in a collapse set to tip power even further into the hands of Amazon and big-box retailers such as Walmart.The 70-year-old retailer that helped shape the toy industry decades ago still has more than 700 stores and brings in about a fifth of all US toy revenues. After filing for bankruptcy in September, Toys suffered a tough holiday sales season, worsening the prospects for restructuring its debt. The company plans to file for liquidation before a bankruptcy hearing on Thursday, said people with knowledge of the matter. Stores will not shut immediately, but through an “orderly wind-down”, they added.Toys R Us declined to comment.The demise of Toys R Us, the largest standalone toy seller, marks the end of an era and will make toymakers across the globe more reliant on Amazon and Walmart to stock their products. Suppliers and vendors had been preparing for the worst in recent weeks, halting shipments after Toys R Us missed payments, said people familiar with the matter. “No toymaker will be spared entirely” from the fall of Toys R Us, warned Stephanie Wissink, equity analyst at Jefferies. Ms Wissink estimates 85 to 90 per cent of the inventory that would have gone to Toys will end up being sold through Amazon, Walmart and Target, making the industry even more dependent on ecommerce and supercentres to sell their products. Kohl’s, JCPenney and Best Buy might also pick up some inventory. But that means 10 to 15 per cent of goods that would have lined the aisles of Toys R Us might not find a home elsewhere. Selling more on Amazon will add pressure on prices, she added. The liquidation process could also drag down prices in the near term, as Toys R Us offers steep discounts to get rid of inventory. We didn’t want to give them stuff for their liquidation saleWhile shoppers had already begun buying more toys from Amazon and Walmart, Toys R Us still drove more than $7bn in US sales last year, dealing a blow to an industry under threat. Mattel swung to a surprise loss in its latest quarter, and has previously blamed a sharp drop in sales on the Toys R Us bankruptcy. Rival Hasbro reported an unexpected sales decline in the quarter.Shares in Hasbro and Mattel dropped as news spread of the renewed turmoil at Toys R Us. Shares in Hasbro are down 6 per cent this week, while Mattel has lost 15 per cent. The biggest losers, however, may be the smaller toy manufacturers. Because Toys R Us only sells toys, the company was a breeding ground for newer or less well-known brands to test their popularity. “It's going to be harder for smaller companies to find that initial toe in the water,” says Chris Byrne, editor at trade publication TTPM.Toys R Us has been rearranging its debt burden for years, after taking a $7.5bn leveraged buyout in 2005. The company has spent more than $250m a year servicing some $5bn in long-term debt. After filing for Chapter 11 protection, rattling the sector, Toys R Us had tried to pitch its bankruptcy as an opportunity to free itself from the shackles of its venture capital lenders. The company took a $3.1bn loan to keep stores open and announced plans to raise employee wages and invest in technology. But toy sales during the crucial holiday shopping season — when Toys R Us makes nearly half of its annual revenues — were sluggish across the sector. Even as total US retail sales were robust during the holiday period, toy sales fell, according to NPD Group. Toys R Us declined to release its holiday season sales figures. “Both [Hasbro and Mattel] have been preparing for a world without Toys R Us since September,” Mr Byrne said. However, “we’ve seen the retail environment change in the past, but never quite so big as this”.Toymakers in the US and Asia had been winding down shipments to Toys R Us in recent weeks as the situation darkened. “We didn’t want to give them stuff for their liquidation sale,” said one vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the UK, Toys R Us on Wednesday unveiled plans to shut all 100 stores after administrators failed to find a buyer. Meanwhile, the fate of its Canadian business, which has been more successful, is still open. MGA Entertainment, the toymaker behind Bratz dolls, is trying to pull together a bid for Toys R Us’ Canadian business, the company told Bloomberg on Wednesday.

19;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2018-02-07T17:26:27Z;Hollywood blockbusters fail to lift Hasbro sales;Company behind ‘Star Wars’ toys reveals unexpected sales fall;Hollywood blockbusters were not enough to lift Hasbro sales at the end of the year, as the company behind Star Wars toys and Frozen princess dolls revealed an unexpected decline in sales.Revenues fell nearly 2 per cent from a year ago to $1.6bn in the three months to the end of December, against analysts’ estimates of a rise to $1.72bn. Hasbro had guided for growth of between 4 and 7 per cent. Despite the disappointing quarter, Hasbro’s $5.2bn of sales in 2017 surpassed that of rival Mattel, after playing second fiddle for more than two decades. As YouTube and Amazon have upended the business of selling toys, allowing independent products such as fidget spinners to usurp traditional big-budget rollouts, Hasbro has looked to shield itself through tie-ups with Hollywood films. In 2015, Hasbro began to develop Disney’s Princess dolls, snatching the business from Mattel, which had owned the licensing rights for two decades. Analysts say the company’s growth has been pinned to its evolution from toy to entertainment company, helping Hasbro succeed as Mattel has stumbled. However, the latest results raise some questions about how much it can rely on this strategy. Hasbro’s sales in the quarter were weighed by a drop in partner brands including Star Wars and Disney’s Frozen.“Overall consumer demand slowed in November and December both for the industry and for Hasbro,” said Brian Goldner, chief executive. However, he does not believe there is “Star Wars fatigue”. The December premiere of The Last Jedi was the franchise’s third new film in three years.Overall consumer demand slowed in November and December both for the industry and for HasbroHasbro swung to a loss of $5.3m, or 4 cents a share, in the three months ended in December, compared with earnings of $192.7m, or $1.52 a share, in the same quarter last year. Hasbro said it recorded a $296.5m charge associated with US tax reforms that came into force at the start of the year. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.30 a share were above analysts’ expectations of $1.80. The results come after rival Mattel posted an unexpected loss in the fourth quarter amid weak demand for some of its key products such as Hot Wheels and Barbie. Both toymakers have had to grapple with the Toys R Us bankruptcy last September, which accounted for a chunk of their sales.Hasbro shares were up more than 6 per cent on Wednesday. The stock has gained 11 per cent in the past three months, while Mattel has gained more than 30 per cent — helped by speculation that it would be bought by Hasbro.

Hasbro’s growth has also been pinned to its evolution from being a toy company to an entertainment company through such franchises but its latest results are expected to raise questions about how much further it could rely on such a strategy.Hasbro shares are up 3 per cent year-to-date following a near 17 per cent rise last year.

The doll’s latest role is junk bond queen. Moody’s this week busted the rating for senior unsecured debt of owner Mattel down below investment grade to reflect poor performance.Time for Barbie to stop snubbing the friendly overtures of Biddy, the M&A banker. Otherwise, Mattel could eventually end up in the clutches of Betsy, the distressed debt investor, or Billie, the fearsome Chapter 11 lawyer.The Christmas period is crucial to Mattel’s fortunes. The company already expects it to be bad, warning that fourth-quarter operating margin will be “significantly lower” than for the same period last year, when it was 13.4 per cent. Full-year sales will be “mid to high single digits lower”.This only confirms what had already been assumed by Barbie’s fund manager friend, Smart Beata. Operating profits for 2017 will probably be negligible before adjustments, well into negative numbers after them. Cutting costs of $650m by 2020 will mean squeezing suppliers. Some may find better customers for consignments of teeny weeny garments.Hasbro, for example. The rival US group previously depended on board games and such boys’ toys as Nerf guns. But it pushed deep into sparkly frock territory earlier this decade when it relieved Mattel of Disney franchises to produce princess dolls. The collapse of Toys ‘R’ Us also hurt Mattel. This could be dismissed as a one-off were it not indicative of wider disruption. Hasbro is better managed and better positioned to cope. This is reflected in a 2016 full-year operating margin almost 6 percentage points higher at 14.4 per cent. Net debt is far lower as a multiple of earnings.It would be a blow to economic empowerment for a posse of princesses to bail out Barbie the multi tasker.

23;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-12-11T17:37:35Z;Mattel warns of weak holiday sales, gets hit with rating downgrades;;Barbie may be on top of girls’ holiday wish lists this year but that has not been enough to keep Mattel from issuing a bleak holiday outlook.The US toymaker on Monday revised its outlook for the full-year, warning that sales in the holiday quarter will continue to be “negatively impacted” by tighter inventory at key retailers and as a result of its underperforming brands.Mattel said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects 2017 full-year gross sales to decline by mid-to-high single digits compared with the previous year when they fell 3 per cent. That is also a sharper drop from its previous guidance for a mid-single digit decline.The company, which suspended its dividend earlier this year and has repeatedly rebuffed takeover offers from Hasbro, also said negative sales trends could result in “additional gross margin deterioration” and that its operating income margin, excluding severance related expenses, will be “significantly lower” than the fourth quarter of 2016. Mattel also said it plans to offer $1bn of senior unsecured notes due in 2025 and use the proceeds to repay debt due next year and other outstanding borrowings.The holiday shopping season, which begins the week of Black Friday and continues through the end of the year, accounts for 35 to 40 per cent of the toy industry’s sales. Analysts have cautioned that consumers may choose to delay purchases this year as Christmas falls on a Monday, which could prompt many to delay shopping to the weekend immediately prior to the holiday.The bleak trading outlook and planned debt offering prompted the three major rating agencies to downgrade their view on the company.Moody’s stripped Mattel of its investment grade status, lowering its rating its ratings to ‘Ba3″ from ‘Baa3′ with a stable outlook. Analysts at the agency cited the “company’s weak performance year to date, and recently lowered profit expectations for the important 2017 fourth quarter holiday season,” which will contribute to much higher than expected year-end leverage. Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings, pushed Mattel deeper into junk territory, cutting its rating by one notch to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’, with a negative outlook. While Fitch also junked the company after it slashed its ratings by 2 notches from ‘BBB-’ to ‘BB’, with a negative outlook.Traditional toymakers have faced stiff competition as the industry become more fragmented with companies like Spin Masters, MGA Entertainment and upstarts like Moose Toys all battling for children’s attention and as children opt for games on devices like iPads and tablets.Mattel has also suffered after it lost the license for Disney Princess and Frozen dolls to Hasbro while its efforts to overhaul existing brands have failed to gain enough traction to offset those declines. The company hired Margo Georgiadis, one of Google’s top advertising executives earlier this year to help lead the toymaker in an evolving digital world and trim its underperforming brands. But the company’s inability to effectively respond to changing play patterns and the recent Toys R Us bankruptcy have dragged on sales, leaving Hasbro on track to surpass Mattel’s annual sales for the first time since 1993.Despite the deluge of disappointing news Mattel shares were up 1 per cent to $15.20 at pixel time and are down 45 per cent so far this year.Read more: Toymakers rethink traditional playbook
24;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-11-21T17:35:09Z;Toymakers rethink traditional playbook;Big groups look to evolve for the digital age as they try to lift stalling sales;An hour after the news broke that Hasbro had made a takeover approach to Mattel that would unite the world’s two largest toymakers, Mattel hosted a doll party.Girls and parent chaperones made their way through 40,000 square feet of ritzy real estate devoted to American Girl, Mattel’s crown jewel luxury doll. The maker of Barbie is trying to resurrect its glamour, seeking to capture nostalgia for American Girl dolls that became ubiquitous in the 1990s, with the opening two weeks ago of a flagship store in New York’s Rockefeller Plaza.But American Girl is under threat. After an era of stable growth, sales of the $115 doll slipped in 2015 and 2016, and are down 18 per cent so far this year. Mattel has had an equally torrid year, suspending its dividend last month after having lost a third of its stock value as sales dropped 10 per cent. Privately owned Danish group Lego is also battling falling sales. Having grown to become the world’s most profitable toymaker in the $90bn global toy market, it reported its first sales slide in a decade in September as first-half revenues slipped 5 per cent. The internet has upended toymakers’ decades-old business models, allowing cheap independent products such as fidget spinners and slime to usurp traditional big-budget rollouts. Such crazes can spread online in a matter of hours, while large-scale carefully planned launches take months.Josh Loerzel, vice-president at Zing, an Oregon toy manufacturer that makes fidget spinners, says “this has flipped the script . . . it’s about how quickly you can react”. In this environment Hasbro has been more spry, analysts say. The maker of Nerf guns has long played second fiddle to Mattel, but it is catching up. According to Bloomberg data, Hasbro is on track to surpass Mattel’s annual sales for the first time since 1993 and as investors have dumped Mattel, its market capitalisation has risen to almost double that of its rival at more than $11.8bn. Hasbro’s net revenues have climbed to $3.6bn in the year to date, up nearly 7 per cent from a year ago, compared with $3.3bn for Mattel.Toy sales have been growing at a rate of about 3 per cent a year since 2011, according to market researchers NPD Group, although the business has become more unpredictable, leading toymakers to seek safety in film and television.The strategy worked for Lego, which had great success with its Lego movie franchise after its first cinema release in 2014. Meanwhile, Hasbro has “evolved from being just a straight toy company to a global entertainment company”, says Chris Byrne, editor of trade publication Toys, Tots, Pets & More. “That’s been the real distinction between [Hasbro and Mattel].”“It’s a really cyclical business that is driven by the whims of an eight-year-old . . . movies are on some level viewed as a safer revenue stream,” he says. This year almost 30 toy lines were licensed from Hollywood films — three times that of last year. These tie-ups make up about 30 per cent of all toy sales, according to NPD.Hasbro in 2015 began to develop Disney’s Princess dolls, snatching the business from Mattel which had owned the rights for two decades. This month Paramount Pictures struck a five-year production deal to make films and TV shows based on Hasbro toys, after the companies teamed up for the popular Transformers films.With children glued to iPads and smartphones, Mattel is trying to launch itself into the 21st century. After two years of searching for a permanent chief executive, the company hired Margo Georgiadis, one of Google’s top advertising executives, to lead the company in a “rapidly evolving digital world”.It is diversifying with the acquisition of wearable baby monitor Sproutling and plans to launch an interactive version of its Hot Wheels car. Mattel is also hoping the Hollywood playbook will augur its fortunes, preparing a line of dinosaur action figures to accompany the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom movie due for release in June. By comparison, Hasbro is poised to benefit from no fewer than eight Marvel films next year, including Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, alongside a Han Solo spin-off and the company’s very own Bumblebee film.Mattel has also overhauled old brands. For instance, Barbie offers different body shapes, skin tones and cultural backgrounds. But critics say it has been too slow to make decisions and launch new products.“The root problem we see is not that the company has too many [brands], but that it has too many bad ones,” says Gerrick Johnson, analyst at BMO. He adds that its turnround strategy is “heavy on consultant-speak and light on actual details”, but with a new management team, “sacred cows will be slayed”.Mattel has cut brands and new launches by 30 per cent this year, with another 20 per cent planned next year. The company says that its corporate restructuring, which aims to slash $650m in costs, will help cut in half the time it takes to bring products to market.Stephanie Wissink, analyst at Jefferies, says Mattel has an “identity crisis”. All of its business units except for entertainment have lost sales this year, including a 7 per cent drop for Barbie and an 11 per cent slide at Fisher-Price.“Hasbro has a clear identity: media . . . what is Mattel?” she asks. Ms Georgiadis is moving towards technology, but this is a “big grey area” filled with privacy risks and the hefty costs of bringing products to market quickly. Competition concerns and an “undervalued” offer prompted Mattel to rebuff Hasbro’s approach, according to a Reuters report last week. A tie-up would give the combined group control over 25 per cent of the global toy business, and 30 per cent of the US, which analysts caution could raise eyebrows with regulators. The companies have flirted with a combination before, although Mattel’s stock plunge makes it more feasible. A merger could give the toymakers more negotiating power for shelf space and help them “weather the complex retail landscape more effectively”, says Ellen Itskovitz, analyst at Fitch. The industry’s move deeper into film and content has raised speculation that Hasbro may not be the only suitor for Mattel. It could also draw bids from an entertainment company such as Disney or Viacom, says BMO’s Mr Johnson, who values Mattel’s brands at more than $10bn.The prospect of consolidation follows Toys R Us filing for bankruptcy in September, a disruptive event that surprised even the retailer’s largest vendors. Both Hasbro and Mattel said the bankruptcy had hurt their sales in the third quarter, with Mattel, blaming it for more than half the North American revenue decline.Until now, Mattel’s losses have been largely Hasbro’s gain, although investors indicate a tie-up could benefit both: Mattel’s stock has jumped by a third since reports of Hasbro’s interest.As for American Girl, Ms Wissink says that while it is “the Louis Vuitton of toys”, it faces competition from cheaper unbranded rivals. “Consumers today are savvy and they are looking at face value versus the price. When you walk through these [American Girl] stores, you will see little girls bringing in a Walmart doll but she didn’t front the $115 purchase.”Barbie, invented by Ruth Handler in 1959, reigns supreme in the National Retail Federation’s US survey of “hot toys” for girls for a third year in a row as Christmas approaches. But closing in fast is Spin Master’s Hatchimals — the fuzzy toy that emerges from a plastic egg shell and is then cared for by its owners that pet it, feed it and teach it how to talk. The survey of 7,439 consumers showed that for at least the seventh year running “everything is awesome” for Denmark’s Lego as it is expected to lead the list of toys for boys.But Adobe Digital Insight’s predictions based on “social buzz” show somewhat different results. While the list included Barbie and Hatchimals, Hasbro’s Nerf Guns, Australian company Moose Toys’ miniature collectibles Shopkins, and Spin Master’s animated series-inspired Paw Patrol are expected to be top sellers.And in the wake of Toys R Us bankruptcy the internet is also expected to play another crucial role — US online toy sales are projected to rise 24 per cent year on year, according to Adobe.While the reports signal strong competition for Lego, Hasbro and Mattel from upstarts such as Spin Master and Moose Toys, analysts say that the key to sales is getting shoppers in the door earlier and more frequently. With Christmas this year falling on a Monday, many would-be Santas are likely to hold out for bargains on the final weekend.

Shares slumped, sales dropped and Mattel suspended its dividend.Short sellers, who borrow shares and sell them in the hopes of buying them for a cheaper price when they need to deliver later, zeroed in on the company.Last week, short interest in Mattel topped out at 33 per cent of shares outstanding, making it the most shorted stock in the S&P 500 benchmark index, according to IHS Markit. For comparison, short interest on the S&P 500 was 2.6 per cent of shares outstanding for all companies in the index.Enter Hasbro. The maker of the Monopoly board game (ironically enough), made a play for its rival Mattel in a move that would unite the two largest toy companies in the US. Shares in Mattel — once the larger of the two rival toymakers — soared.“Dare we say, Hasbro is the Grinch who stole short sellers’ early Christmas present,” says Simon Colvin, a research analyst at IHS Markit.A short position taken in Mattel in the days leading up to the bankruptcy of Toys R Us would have returned about 20 per cent, ahead of the Hasbro offer. The ensuing jump in Mattel’s shares, which have rallied more than a fifth since Friday, caught short sellers off guard. Short sellers now are collectively down about $500m on Mattel, Mr Colvin estimates.Shorting retail is always a hot topic heading into the holiday season. That is particularly true this year with the outlook for traditional brick and mortar retailers darkening against the increasing adoption of online shopping. The chastening Mattel experience shows, however, that the returns on what can appear to be even the most obvious candidates for the naughty list are not always nice.nicole.bullock@ft.com

Two big multibillion-dollar deals — by Hasbro to take over rival games company Mattel and Brookfield Asset Management’s $14.5bn bid for the stake it already does not own in mall owner GGP — enlivened an otherwise sluggish trading day.Mattel’s shares rose 20.7 per cent on Monday following reports that Hasbro, the maker of Monopoly board games and Nerf guns, had made a play for its rival, which is currently valued at just over $6bn after Monday’s gains.Mattel’s advance was the biggest in the S&P 500 index, but Hasbro investors also responded positively to the reports, sending its shares up 5.9 per cent.While the Mattel-Hasbro talks have yet to be confirmed by the companies — and they also held informal talks early this year — Brookfield Asset Management confirmed on Monday that it had bid about $14.8bn for the 66 per cent of GGP it does not already own, as it plans to “transform or reposition” the company’s shopping mall empire, which has come under pressure from the rise of online commerce.GGP’s shares had climbed over 16 per cent last week on the first reports of the imminent deal, and rose another 8.3 per cent on Monday after Brookfield confirmed the talks. Canada-based Brookfield’s shares were up just 0.4 per cent on the day.Elsewhere, shares in WisdomTree sank 5.5 per cent after the exchange-traded fund provider announced a deal to buy ETF Securities’ $17.6bn European business. While the deal will catapult WisdomTree into the upper echelons of the fast-growing ETF industry, the $611m cash-and-shares acquisition meant the company had to cut its dividend.The deal reactions came during a generally downbeat trading session. While the S&P 500 managed to claw back losses in early trading to trade up 0.1 per cent, the biggest gainers were in traditionally safer sectors.Industrial stocks fell 0.5 per cent, dragged down by General Electric announcing only its second dividend cut since 1938 to preserve its cash, while energy shares also shed 0.5 per cent.The bout of risk aversion helped buoy defensive segments, such as consumer staples and utilities. The S&P 500 sub-indices for those industries rose 0.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.Among the gainers was Tyson Foods, the US meat processor, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its dividend after rising demand from a growing global middle class buoyed sales across its four main divisions, helping to boost its stock by 2 per cent, nearing an all-time high.

Its third-quarter revenue in North America was down by a fifth, with half of the fall being blamed on the disruption at Toys R US. Hasbro issued a disappointing outlook when it reported results last month, also blaming weakness on the Toys R US crisis.Mattel’s market capitalisation stands at about $5bn, having dropped nearly 50 per cent this year. The company has shaken up senior management, bringing on Margo Georgiadis, a former Google executive, to turn the toymaker round. Hasbro has a market capitalisation of $11bn.While global toy industry sales have been growing steadily at about 3 per cent a year since 2011, manufacturers have been hurt by the ever-shorter life cycles of products and the rising dominance of Amazon. They have also struggled to compete as children spend their playtime with iPads, tablets and other electronic devices.However, Hasbro has outperformed Mattel, finding success by pushing further into the entertainment business. Hasbro scored a coup when it secured a deal to begin making Disney princess dolls last year, snapping a longstanding partnership between Disney and Mattel. The licence gave Hasbro the rights to relaunch all of Disney’s dolls, including princesses Elsa and Anna from Disney’s animated hit Frozen, which has grossed more than $1.2bn worldwide since it hit the big-screen in 2013. Mattel shares rallied more than 23 per cent to $18.08 after the Wall Street Journal first reported that Hasbro had approached the company. Hasbro shares climbed 3 per cent to $94.50 in extended trading. Mattel was junked by S&P Global Ratings last month after it cut its ratings from BBB- to BB with a negative outlook, noting that it expects the company to “continue to experience heightened business risk over the next few years” and prompting it to raise its leverage forecast for Mattel through 2018.Hasbro and Mattel were also reported to have held merger talks in February last year.

Hasbro shares climbed 3 per cent to $94.50. The toymakers were also reported to have held merger talks in February last year.The report comes after Mattel late last month suspended its quarterly dividend amid a sharp drop in sales and Hasbro issued disappointing outlook, both attributing weakness to retail chain Toys R US’ bankruptcy. Toymakers have also struggled to compete as children spend their playtime with iPads, tablets and other electronic devices.Following its results, Mattel was junked by S&P Global Ratings which cut its ratings from BBB- to BB with a negative outlook, noting that they expect the company will “continue to experience heightened business risk over the next few years” and prompting them to raise their leverage forecast for Mattel through 2018.Mattel shares are down 47 per cent so far this year, while Hasbro shares are up 18 per cent over the same period.

That missed analysts’ expectations for earnings of 55 cents, according to survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Earnings were impacted by a non-cash charge related to a valuation allowance on US deferred tax assets. Adjusting for that, the company reported earnings of 9 cents a share.Mattel said its net sales fell 13 per cent to $1.56bn — well short of analysts’ estimates for $1.81bn — weighed down by the Toys R Us bankruptcy and certain underperforming brands.Rival Hasbro also blamed US retail chain Toys R US’ move to file for bankruptcy protection in September when it lowered its lowered its sales outlook.“Our Q3 performance was clearly disappointing, led by compression in North America driven by Toys ‘R’ Us filing for bankruptcy, tighter retailer inventory management and challenges with certain underperforming brands,” said Margo Georgiadis, Mattel’s chief executive. “Despite these challenges, we are making strong progress against our transformation plan, which we believe will deliver step change revenue growth and profitability.”One of those efforts included suspending the company’s quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share to “increase financial flexibility, strengthen the balance sheet and facilitate strategic investments”. The company said it expects the move to result in savings of about $50m a quarter. Overall, Ms Georgiadis plans to lower costs by $650m over the next two years.Mattel said global sales at its Barbie brand fell 6 per cent in the third quarter from a year ago, driven by a shift in its DVD entertainment strategy. Sales in the Barbie brand — which had begun to recover last year as the company introduced three new doll body types in an attempt to broaden appeal — were down for the third consecutive quarter. Sales at its Mattel Girls and Boys Brands overall declined 9 per cent from a year ago to $967m.Sales at its Fisher-Price brands were down 15 per cent year-on-year to $561.6m, while those at its American Girl Brands declined 30 per cent, driven by lower licensing incomes.Mattel shares are down 44 per cent so far this year.

31;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-10-23T11:25:08Z;Hasbro posts downbeat sales outlook citing Toys R Us bankruptcy, economic outlook;;Hasbro shares briefly edged up in early trade after the US toymaker reported upbeat third quarter results despite the drag from the bankruptcy of Toys R Us but disappointed on its revenue outlook for the current quarter.Looking ahead, the retailer expects revenues to rise between 4 and 7 per cent from last year in the fourth quarter — which includes the all important holiday period — reflecting its “new view to the holiday based on Toys R Us and the economic outlook in certain markets”. However, that was shy of the 11 per cent growth implied by analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.The Rhode Island-based company said its profits rose to $265.5m in the three months ended in October, up from $257.8m in the year-ago quarter. That translated to earnings of $2.09 a share, up from $2.03 a share a year earlier and easily topped analysts estimates of $1.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data.However, the company said that its operating profits fell 5 per cent in the US and Canada amid the fallout from Toys R Us bankruptcy filing earlier this year — citing, among other things, competition from online and big box competitors — and a shift in the products the company sold.“Our Brand Blueprint strategy is successfully driving the business despite a challenging economic environment in the U.K. and Brazil, as well as a short-term retailer disruption,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chief executive. “As a result of the Toys R Us bankruptcy filing in the U.S. and Canada, there was a negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating profit.”Hasbro — which passed rival Mattel in quarterly revenues for the first time in about 17 years in the first quarter — said net revenues rose nearly 7 per cent to $1.79bn, above Wall Street estimates of $1.78bn, according a Thomson Reuters poll.A breakdown showed that while its franchise brands like Transformers and My Little Pony did well, driving 7 per cent year-on-year revenue growth, sales at its partner brands slid 2 per cent, as sales of Dreamworks’ Trolls fell a year on from the movie launch.Hasbro shares are up nearly 26 per cent so far this year and were up 1 per cent in pre-market trade before giving up those gains to trade flat.

33;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-05-19T04:02:52Z;Fidget spinner craze turns the toy industry on its head;Big retailers scramble to catch up with fad started by school children via the internet;When Ryan Weaver was laid off from his job on an Alaskan oil rig last year, he says he turned to God to give him “just one idea” to pay off the $160,000 he owed in student debt.The 26-year-old’s salvation came in the form of a decades-old spinning propeller toy. In October his wife, a special education teacher, asked him to order “fidget” gadgets for her class. Noticing that similar toys, designed to relieve stress, were all across YouTube, he decided to try his luck selling them on Amazon. Now he sells 500 to 1,000 spinners a day for $17.95 a pop.“As soon as I got them in stock they were selling like crazy,” Mr Weaver says. “Literally the whole debt has been paid off now…it was really cool because we love Jesus.”Mr Weaver is one of the earlier enterprising adults to take notice of a viral craze that has shaken the $90bn global toy industry. When he first listed fidget spinners in December under the company EWR Products, there were only one or two other sellers on Amazon.Four months later Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is scrambling to air freight spinners directly from Chinese factories to get them into stores faster.In terms of customer inquiries, the fidget spinners are “the biggest craze” for any product Walmart has seen in the past five years, says Michelle Malashock, a spokesperson. The company is circumventing its distribution centres, to quickly replenish stock across its 3,500 supercentres.Unlike previous consumer fads, the fidget spinners craze sprang up in the bowels of the internet. The earliest version emerged in 1997 from Catherine Hettinger, an engineer, who let the patent expire on her invention in 2005. After more than a decade-long lull, newer versions of fidget spinners were recently revived into relevance among schoolchildren on YouTube and Instagram, yielding a cottage industry of anonymous individuals and small toy manufacturers that shipped the gadgets from Chinese factories to American corner stores and gas stations.“It’s the wild west,” says Josh Loerzel, vice president of marketing at Zing, a toy manufacturer that ships to Walmart and Toys R Us. “The biggest toy I’ve seen in at least 10 years, and it’s been a total free-for-all. It’s not a big-bucks driven, premeditated thing. It blew up the opposite way.” It is difficult to gauge the size of the market for fidget spinners. NPD, a data group, does not have figures yet because large corporations such as Walmart and Target only in the past few weeks have begun selling them, and most sales have taken place across a fragmented, murkier marketplace. The big retailers do not disclose individual product sales, although one said it was selling 100,000 spinners a week. Zing expects to ship 4 or 5m fidget spinners this year. Observers say the buzz surrounding fidget spinners underscores how much the toy industry, and more broadly the world of retail, has changed. Toy industry sales have been growing at a rate of about 3 per cent a year since 2011, although toymakers have been hurt by the ever-shorter life cycles of products — mirroring the rise of the fast fashion sold by H&M and Zara — and the emergence of Amazon as the premier destination for online shopping. “This really proves the ability for smaller players to have a big financial impact, through Amazon,” says Matt Quint, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School. “It shows the power of platforms like Amazon and YouTube. When there’s consumer demand it doesn’t really matter who the suppliers are.”With spinners wholesaling for $0.50 to $1.50 from Chinese factories, and no patents or licensing fees to be paid, “the margins are astronomical”, says Chris Byrne, a 30-year toy veteran and editor of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, a trade publication. “Right now the toy industry is in full reactive mode because they don’t want to miss out on those sales. They don’t want to cede ground to Amazon.”While storied brands such as Star Wars have held their cachet in the toy market, newer ones such as Frozen and Finding Dory have a much shorter shelf life, and internet fads such as fidget spinners present an even larger challenge. Mr Loerzel says fast-moving trends favour smaller companies that can work more nimbly. “The big giants [Hasbro and Mattell] typically take up 90 to 95 per cent of the business and everyone else is left scrapping. This has flipped the script…it’s about how quickly you can react.” Mr Loerzel says that during recent meetings with Walmart management in Hong Kong, “all anyone was talking about was spinners”, even though the companies were there to plan products for Spring of 2018. “Things take a while to get to every Walmart, and toys usually have a longer lead time,” says Ms Malashock. “We’re already planning [the Fall season] at this point. But when these things come up, it’s about going through suppliers to jump on it quickly.”Manufacturers said that the vast majority of supply was coming from Chinese factories, which already produce about two-thirds of the output for industry leaders such as Hasbro and Mattel. Chinese manufacturers that traditionally make smartphone accessories have also jumped on the trend. 7-11 said it sources the spinners from “several suppliers” but declined to comment on which countries they came from. Toys R Us said it ships them by air from China. The buzz surrounding fidget spinners also highlights the newfound power of YouTube and Instagram over traditional corporate marketing schemes. “In our modern age, an internet meme can become a manufacturing meme,” says Mr Quint. “There’s no famous brand pushing this. This is for a generation that grew up on YouTube. The whole thing is sort of a mystery…it’s a real lesson for retailers and manufacturers.”
34;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-04-24T10:59:59Z;Hasbro results top estimates as gaming revenues rise;;Hasbro on Monday posted better than expected quarterly results as sales growth in the group’s gaming business helped to offset declines in partner-branded toys, like Star Wars merchandise.Rhode Island-based Hasbro said its earnings rose 41 per cent year-over-year to $68.6m, as revenues climbed 2 per cent to $849.7m. Excluding an 11 cent accounting benefit, earnings per share were 43 cents.The results exceeded Wall Street expectations of EPS of 38 cents on sales of $819.7m.Hasbro’s upbeat results sent shares rising 2.6 per cent in pre-market trading. They drew a stark comparison with rival Mattel, which posted a nearly 14 per cent decline on Friday after its quarterly figures missed forecasts.“Our first quarter results are in line with our previously communicated expectations and we are well positioned to execute against 2017’s rich content slate and diverse new initiatives,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chief executive.Hasbro’s gaming category, which includes brands like the Monopoly board game and the Magic: The Gathering card game, shined. Revenues there rose 10 per cent to $253.3m.On the opposite side of the spectrum its partner brand sales deteriorated on the back of strong comparisons in the previous year’s quarter that included the hit film Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Sales in partner brands slid 18 per cent to $213m.Mr Goldner noted, however, that “over the coming quarters, we are supporting significant new initiatives including major theatrical films for both franchise [core] and partner brands”.
35;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2017-04-21T17:57:18Z;Why Hasbro and Mattel shares are telling two different stories;;Two of the world’s biggest toymakers, that were rumored to be considering a tie-up last year, are displaying two very different fortunes.While both Mattel and Hasbro face stiffer competition from electronic gadgets, Mattel shares are down nearly 19 per cent so far this year —with the shares down 12 per cent on Friday after the California-based toymaker posted disappointing first quarter results.Hasbro —which is slated to report results next week and likely expected to see a bump from Beauty and the Beast — has on the other hand seen its shares advance nearly 24 per cent over the same period.So what’s prompted investors to sweeten on Hasbro and sour on its rival?Hasbro scored a major coup when it secured a deal to begin making Disney princess dolls last year and torpedoed a long-standing partnership between Disney and Mattel.The license gave Hasbro the rights to relaunch all of Disney’s dolls, including princesses Elsa and Anna from Disney’s animated hit Frozen, which has grossed more than $1.2bn worldwide since it hit the silver screen in 2013, according to Box Office Mojo, making it the ninth highest grossing film of all time. And the chill from the loss of the Frozen franchise was clear.Hasbro revenues jumped 13 per cent in 2016 to $5.02bn, from a year ago, with annual sales jumping for the third straight year. By contrast, Mattel, the maker of Barbie Dolls and Hot Wheels, posted a 4 per cent drop in worldwide net sales last year to $5.5bn — its third consecutive year of revenue declines.And it isn’t just Frozen. The success of the Star Wars films also invigorated sales at Hasbro. Meanwhile, Mattel worked to revive interest in Barbie.Indeed, the company which had drawn criticism for years over Barbie’s unrealistic figure, launched three new Barbie body types — tall, curvy and petite — with a range of hairstyles and skin tones as part of its Fashionista line. And for a while it appeared to work with sales up in the first nine months of last year. But the crucial holiday quarter proved disappointing and management blamed inventory overhang for weaker sales in the first three months of the year.Despite the disappointing first-quarter sales, Mattel president Richard Dickson maintained his confidence in the brand, noting the Fashionista segment continued to exceed expectations. He also added the company was continuing to engage girls by moving into episodic content and continuing the roll-out of Dreamtopia, a make-believe world imagined by Barbie’s youngest sister Chelsea — meant to build on the success of the animated TV movie that hit small screens last year.Despite Friday’s sharp drop however, there may be reason to temper the pessimism on Mattel.The company is looking forward to the release of Disney’s Cars 3 in the second quarter and analysts note that Justice League, Fast & Furious and Wonder Woman could be other drivers for Mattel this year.And Tim Condor an analyst at Wells Fargo thinks that shares of toy manufacturers are positioned for longer-term growth citing “favourable global birth demographics projected through 2020, low pre-school penetration in international markets,” and likely increasing preference among global retailers for larger companies with owned and licenses intellectual property rights especially those tied to entertainment.Moreover, the company appointed Margo Georgiadis, a former Google exec, its new CEO earlier this year. A move that some think could signal a growing focus on technology and connectivity at a time when toymakers face stiff competition from tablets, phones and other electronic devices.

Sales at the division fell 3 per cent during the quarter to $552.3m as the frenzy that drove sales of Star Wars products a year ago faded.Overall, revenue for the quarter climbed 11 per cent to $1.63bn, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of $1.5bn. Net profits rose to $192.7m, or $1.52 per share, from $175.8m, or $1.39 per share in the same three-month period in 2015.On an adjusted basis, which excludes certain charges, earnings per share of $1.64 also exceeded estimates of $1.28.

They were up by 6.2 per cent year-to-date as of Friday’s close.In the fourth quarter, Hasbro’s girls division notched revenue growth of 52 per cent to $394.2m, helped by Disney Princess and Disney Frozen dolls and Dreamworks’s Trolls. The games unit experienced growth of 11 per cent, while Boys sales fell 3 per cent, and pre-school revenues slipped 4 per cent.Top photo credit: Hasbro
38;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-12-22T05:02:23Z;Review – Monopoly gives you more power than Donald Trump;With Ultimate Banking, the board game is revamped for the digital age;"Our Monopoly set is about 50 years old. But apart from a fraying box cover and a couple of handwritten title deeds to replace property cards lost, it remains in remarkably playable condition given the number of outings it still gets.So our affection for the traditional game meant we opened Hasbro’s newest variation with a certain lack of enthusiasm. Mrs B, aka “The Shoe”, known to accumulate rent from her near-bankrupt flesh and blood with Rachmanesque ruthlessness, cried off, claiming pressure of work. “The Boat”, played by 14-year-old daughter who eschews rival board games for a marathon Monopoly session, affected passing indifference for this upstart alternative.It was left to “The Car”, the 13-year-old boy, to set up this latest, cash-free version, complete with electronic card-reader and a 15-page rule book. It took him only an hour.Purists will find much at fault: the removal of Chance and Community Chest cards; the plastic helicopter and plane tokens that replace the metallic iron and top hat; a rather forbidding, dark-coloured board with stations and utilities nowhere to be seen. Even the gloomy-coloured dice look spooky.Still, the old property names have survived — and there is also that familiar sense of sod’s law after landing in jail three times in quick succession, even if it costs twice as much to pay your way out.So this is what life under bitcoin looks like. Lost completely is the heartless pleasure in seeing your son count up and then hand over £330 in used readies for landing on your three houses on Bow StreetThe question is whether our real-life cashless consumer habit can muscle its way into Sunday afternoons around the dining table. Not on this showing.“I don’t like not having any cash in front of me,” said daughter, in a hurry to go bankrupt as quickly as possible so she could go and straighten her hair.The absence of notes is destabilising, not unlike the demise of newsprint. Worse still, although properties have retained their original numerical value, the pound has been dumped for a currency with no name. So this is what life under bitcoin looks like. Lost completely is the heartless pleasure in seeing your son count up and then hand over £330 in used readies for landing on your three houses on Bow Street.Family rule variations developed over the years by Monopoly fans in the Blitz household — such as collecting £400 for landing on Go, or picking up a small fortune in school fees and other bank penalties by landing on No Parking — have no place in this digital economy.Clearly, neither does the ability to count. Wealth was gained and lost far too quickly for comfort each time a card was inserted into the card reader. We were fast turning into curmudgeons,more so because of the racket of electronic jingles the card reader produced every time it was activated.This version requires some buy-in of its premise — that in today’s tech-driven world, Monopoly should not have to be a five-hour test of monetary discipline. This is a fast-paced adaptation, in which houses are bought without having to own a set, rents are increased each time the property is landed on, and any property of one’s choosing can be bought when a player lands on one of four Location spaces. Donald Trump in his real estate pomp had less power.That takes out the time-consuming need to trade properties (always guaranteed to raise hackles), or to wait patiently until the moment a player thinks his or her strategy is going to lead to ultimate victory — completing the set of stations, building hotels on Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road, or some other doomed approach.Actually, this digital dash for domination was, at one point, going rather well. With daughter long departed to her tongs, son threw a nine that plonked him on my four Mayfair houses. Yesss!!!! Pay up, sucker — that’s 1,200 big ones. But as he placed his bank card on the reader to complete his humiliating descent into penury, all the game’s transactions were mysteriously wiped. Cyber hacking? Or, as the boy hurriedly packed the game away, was this a fat-finger fix? Honestly, the kids of today just can’t bear losing.Monopoly Ultimate Banking; Hasbro Gaming; from toy and games retailers, RRP £17.99"
39;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-12-16T16:47:36Z;Christmas comes early for top toymakers;From Hatchimals to Barbie, the hottest toys this festive season lift the groups behind them;Christmas is coming: an event as exciting for the toymakers hoping to fill stockings with this year’s hottest new playthings as it is for the children who will open them on December 25.Expectations of a bumper festive period have brought early Christmas presents for investors in companies such as Spin Master, Hasbro and Nintendo — manufacturers behind some of the biggest hits — that have all had a good year on the stock market.The Christmas crackers are the usual mix of new, must-have toys and some familiar faces. But analysts are betting that the products most likely to make it will be interactive, linked to well-known franchises, such as Star Wars, collectibles or family games.“Some form of licensing has become critically important. A lot of kids have a smartphone and so they are far more connected than you and I were as kids,” said Matt Hudak, toys and games analyst at Euromonitor. “Parents are looking more and more for that interactive element.”The holiday season is critical for Mattel, Hasbro and other toy companies as their fourth quarters account for more than a third of annual revenues. Toy sales are up 6.5 per cent between January and September in the US alone, according to NPD, and the research group is forecasting strong sales during the holiday season, boosted by higher prices and two additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas — one of those landing on a Saturday.In the UK, record Black Friday sales and expectations that prices will rise next year due to the weaknesses of sterling also suggest a good season for toymakers.HatchimalThe furry toy that hatches from an egg is this year’s knockout Christmas gift. It is already so popular that US retailer Target is limiting sales to two per person — if shoppers can find one in the first place.As ever, some parents are prepared to pay up to secure this year’s must-have gift. A Hatchimal retailing at $59.99 on Target.com on Thursday sold on Ebay for $132.50 and is for sale at $199 at a merchant on Amazon.com.Its runaway success appears to have taken recently listed Spin Master, the Canadian manufacturer of the toy, by surprise. It posted a note on its website stating that demand had exceeded all expectations and that it was ramping up production.“We don’t want anyone to be disappointed, nor do we support inflated prices from non-authorised resellers. While additional product will hit retail shelves in December, we anticipate this inventory will also sell out quickly.”Shares in the Toronto-listed group, which also makes other popular products, including Zoomer Chimp and Paw Patrol, have risen more than 70 per cent in the past year to hit a new high.Launched in October, Hatchimals are reminiscent of Bandai of Japan’s Tamagotchis from the 1990s as both are toys that encourage children to nurture. The eggs contain touch technology allowing children to interact with the shell, which then indicates when it is ready to hatch. The furry toy that emerges is also interactive and there are several families of Hatchimal, creating an element of surprise as to which furry creature will pop out.Mr Hudak said that the relatively high price tag on a Hatchimal made them less of a collectable item than the Shopkins range of small toys, but the fact that there were several types would drive desire to own more than one.BarbieYou know you’ve made a successful comeback when comedian, writer and actress Amy Schumer is in the running to play you in a movie. This is especially so for Barbie who just a couple of years ago fell out of favour with parents across the US due to her unrealistic body shape and monoethnicity.But Mattel, the company with the biggest global market share for toys and games, has finally modernised the world’s best known plastic doll to reflect the US’s increasingly diverse population and celebrate the different shapes and sizes of girls and women.It has worked. As Juliana Chugg, Mattel’s global brand officer, said last month: “Barbie is on fire.“Barbie has two key consumers: the girls who request to play with the product and the mums who approve and purchase the product. Barbie had only maintained a connection with one. This was really creating tension in the purchase decision.”Having introduced 23 multicultural Barbie types, with eight skin tones and a variety of body sizes, Mattel reported “double-digit” sales growth globally for Barbie in its most recent quarter, the first time in four years, the company said.Barbie tops the National Federation of Retailers’ list of the most popular girls gifts in the US this year while her Dream House was among the most popular toys bought online on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Digital Index. This home upgrades into a wifi-enabled smart house with floor sensors, embedded speech recognition and stairs that transform into a slide.Super Mario RunReleased on Thursday, Super Mario Run — Nintendo’s first smartphone game featuring the world’s most famous plumber — is a gift that will be played under the dinner table by children and adults nostalgic for the 1980s alike.The scrolling platform game is affordable, easy to play with one finger and there is no worry it will be sold out. All you need is an iPhone, a $10 iTunes gift card and an internet connection.After decades of sticking to its video game consoles, Super Mario Run is Nintendo’s most aggressive attempt to capture the $36bn smartphone games market. From when the game was revealed in September until its release, shares had risen 12 per cent and bullish analysts have projected it could generate $500m in revenues by the end of March.The Kyoto-based company’s pricing strategy is unique. Super Mario Run, distributed only via the iOS App store, can be played free of charge for the first three levels but there is a one-off cost of $9.99 for the full version. While the price is small for a Christmas gift, $10 is expensive compared with other smartphone games that adopt a “freemium” model of paid in-game upgrades.Analysts are divided on whether the pricing strategy will work but there seems little doubt that the game will be a big hit over the holiday season.“Demand for Nintendo games as a Christmas gift has always been very strong. It’s easy to imagine that parents will buy iTunes gift cards and tell their children to go play with Mario,” said Hirokazu Hamamura, gaming industry expert at Japanese publishing and media company Kadokawa Dwango.Investors seemed unimpressed, however, with Nintendo shares closing down 4 per cent on Friday — wiping $1.5bn dollars from its market value.LegoThe phenomenally popular interlocking plastic bricks have topped the NRF’s toy wishlist for boys since 2012 and this year is no different, not least because the world’s most profitable toy company enjoys strong demand for its licensed Lego products, such as Star Wars.This Christmas, Lego will continue to benefit from this partnership, with many of the figures and vehicles from this month’s Star Wars spin-off Rogue One expected to be among the most-wanted.On Cyber Monday, Lego was among the best-selling items online, according to Adobe Digital Index, holding the top position for the number of units sold and most revenue generated.Target says Lego’s Friend Amusement Park Bumper Cars and AT-ST Walker sets are proving popular, while Amazon says the Danish company’s Disney Moana’s Ocean Voyage will be among its top sellers this season.Lego has enjoyed years of double-digit profit growth thanks to the leadership of Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who embraced the rise of digital entertainment while rivals such as Mattel struggled to accept the new reality of the toy industry.The Dane is stepping into the chairmanship role just as Lego’s pace of expansion is beginning to slow from, admittedly, unsustainable levels. The success of its holiday season in the world’s largest toy market will be an important indicator of how well initiatives with its retailers in the US to improve marketing and displays in store are faring.————-Most searched toys globally in past week*
40;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-10-17T21:31:06Z;Hasbro shares shine as earnings exceed expectations;Consumer discretionary stocks lead S&P 500 decline;As earnings season kicks into high gear this week on Wall Street, shares of toymaker Hasbro had their biggest one-day rise in more than a year after the second-largest US toymaker reported third-quarter earnings that easily beat investors’ expectations.Hasbro managed to offset fading sales of Star Wars toys thanks to a 57 per cent surge in its girls-focused business, which logged revenues of $462m in the three months ending September 25. It was helped by its acquisition of global rights for popular Disney Princess and Frozen dolls from rival Mattel.Overall, Hasbro sales for the last quarter grew 14 per cent to $1.68bn, more than the $1.55bn analysts had forecast, while net income was up more than 24 per cent to $257.8m, or $2.03 per diluted share, compared with predictions of $221.1m in net income, about $1.74 a share. Its shares were up 7.4 per cent on Monday, reaching $81.82.Elsewhere, shares of troubled online peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club declined 7.3 per cent to $4.99, after it announced that it was tightening its credit policies for the second time in six months amid efforts to bolster investor demand for its loans as its losses spiral.It has come under pressure in recent months following revelations of a governance scandal that caused many big buyers of its loans to put programmes on hold. It has also found itself facing a new competitor in Goldman Sachs’ recently launched Marcus venture, which threatens to pick off some of Lending Club’s more creditworthy customers by offering no-fee loans, compared to the arrangement fees Lending Club charges borrowers ranging between 1 and 6 per cent.Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which makes heavy machinery, saw its stock fall about 0.4 per cent to $87.29, after it announced that its chairman and chief executive, Doug Oberhelman, would retire next spring.Mr Oberhelman blamed sluggish economic growth and struggles in the energy sector for a drop in the industrial bellwether’s annual revenue, which was $47bn last year from $65.9bn in 2012. Still, “the future is bright”, he insisted.US stocks were weaker on Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping about 0.3 per cent to 2,126.50, the Nasdaq Composite down about 0.3 per cent to 5,199.82 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.3 per cent at 18,086.40.Stocks in the consumer discretionary sector lead the decline on the S&P 500, falling 0.8 per cent, followed by stocks in energy, consumer staples and finance sectors, all down at least 0.4 per cent.
41;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-10-17T11:49:55Z;Disney dolls work magic on Hasbro earnings;;The princesses continue to save the day over at Hasbro.A surge in sales for its Disney Princess and Frozen dolls helped the US’s number two toymaker offset fading Star Wars toys sales to deliver third quarter sales and profits that easily beat expectations.Hasbro took over the global rights to make these dolls from rival Mattel January 1 this year under a licensing deal with Disney. The impact has been nothing short of transformative. Sales at Hasbro’s girls business grew by 57 per cent to $462m in the three months to September 25, helping the division leapfrog over the Games business to become the company’s second biggest money spinner.Meanwhile sales at Hasbro’s all important boys division clocked in a more modest 2 per cent rise to $605.5m as the frenzy that drove sales of Star Wars products appeared to be fading.Overall, revenue for the quarter grew 14 per cent to $1.68bn while net income jumped by more than 24 per cent to $257.8m, or $2.03 per diluted share.The market had forecast revenue of $1.55bn and net income of $221.1m or $1.74 a share.Hasbro shares rose 3.8 per cent in pre-market trading
42;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-09-06T07:36:57Z;Blocked? Lego’s stellar performance stalls;;Lego’s sales growth in the world’s biggest toy market and its profitability both stalled in the first half of the year as the Danish toymaker’s recent stellar performance came to an end.The privately-owned maker of bright plastic bricks still bucked the gloom in the toy market by posting an 11 per cent rise in revenues to DKr15.69bn ($2.35bn) compared with a year earlier, writes Richard Milne.But after years of increasing by double-digit rates, net profit fell by 2 per cent in the first six months of the year to DKr3.49bn.Lego said it had put in place a plan in the US to return the company to growth after flat sales in the first half compared with double-digit increases in Europe and Asia.“In the US, we acknowledge that we have not provided the initiatives and support needed to keep the same high level of growth. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers and dialed up our initiatives in the American market, in order to regain momentum,” said John Goodwin, finance director.The Danish group has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in the past decade, moving from near financial collapse to by far the world’s most profitable toymaker.It has also managed to counter the negative trend many toymakers have experienced as children play more with smartphones and tablets than traditional games.Lego was the biggest toymaker in the world in the first six months of this year, a position it normally loses in the run-up to Christmas as other groups sell more. Its revenues of $2.35bn in the first half compared with $1.83bn at Mattel, the maker of Barbie and Fisher Price, and $1.71bn at Hasbro, which has brands such as Monopoly and My Little Pony.The gap was even bigger on the profitability side with Lego’s $520m in net profit compared with a $92m loss at Mattel and $101m profit at Hasbro.
43;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-09-02T16:57:00Z;Mattel/Toys R Us: Be a doll;Two struggling toy companies now need each other;On Saturday and Sunday mornings in otherwise deserted midtown Manhattan, an orderly line of children and their parents can be found. They are waiting for American Girl Place, a pricey doll and accessories store, to open its doors. But from now on, if families are unwilling to brave the thick crowds, they can venture about 10 blocks south to the nearest Toys R Us store. This week Mattel, owner of the American Girl brand, said it would begin selling a line of its dolls outside of its 20 proprietary boutiques and website by adding 97 Toys R Us locations. Both toymaker Mattel and retailer Toys R Us companies have revived their sagging fortunes of late. An alliance between the pair looks like a natural next step.In 2015, the American Girl line generated $600m in revenue for Mattel, just a tenth of its overall turnover. But sales fell nearly a tenth in that year and another 15 per cent so far in 2016. Hardly kids’ stuff. And Mattel has other problems. It lost the license to Disney’s blockbuster Frozen franchise to rival Hasbro. While Barbie sales have improved of late, the group’s have shrunk. Still, boosted by hopes for its new chief executive’s cost-cutting plans, Mattel shares have rallied nearly 50 per cent in the past year.American Girl is in the middle of its own turnround, including introducing a more modestly priced doll that will feature at Toys R Us. Mattel presumably takes comfort that it can control the customer experience so the elite brand endures. It also must have been reassured by Toys R Us’s own progress. Its zombie LBO from 2004 has not created much value for its private equity owners. But the company has been able to refinance about a billion dollars in upcoming debt maturities so it will muddle forward.No tantrums, then, are expected about American Girl. Ultimately, both Toys R Us and Mattel need orderly queues to form outside its stores.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
44;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-07-20T20:26:42Z;Mattel posts narrower loss as Barbie sales jump;;Investors shopped for Mattel shares on Wednesday after the company known for Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels, posted a narrower than expected loss in the second quarter, as sales of its Barbie toys jumped.The California-based company said sales of Barbie toys jumped 23 per cent. Mattel has taken steps to revive sales of its iconic Barbie dolls, introducing three new body types — tall, curvy and petite — for the toy line earlier this year.Despite the strength in Barbie sales, Mattel reported a loss of $19.1m or 6 cents a share in the three months ended in June, compared with $11.4m or 3 cents a share in the year ago period.Adjusting for one-time items however, a loss of 2 cents a share, was narrower than the 5 cent loss that analysts had forecast.Net sales fell 3 per cent to $957.3m — but the decline was less than feared as analysts’ were looking for sales of $936.7m.Mattel, like other toymakers, has struggled as children have increasingly turned towards iPads and other electronic devices. And earlier this year it was reported that Hasbro had approached Mattel about a possible deal.The toymaker, which recently lost the license to make Frozen and other Disney Princess toys to Hasbro, managed to put a feather back in its cap when it won a toy license deal for Jurassic World. Mattel will be able to sell Jurassic toys beginning July 2017.Mattel shares, which have advanced 21 per cent so far this year, were more than 4 per cent higher in extended trading on Wednesday.
45;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-07-18T20:23:36Z;Battered Groupon shares rally after analyst turns bullish;Deal site buoyant alongside fashion brand Coach, but toy maker Hasbro suffers Star Wars angst;The shares of Groupon, the deals website that has struggled in recent years with concerns about its profitability, rallied on Monday on the back of a bullish broker note.Groupon’s stock price has collapsed by about 80 per cent since its initial public offering in November 2011, which at the time was the biggest IPO since search group Google went public in 2004, as the company’s failure to consistently generate a profit has disappointed investors.The company has in the past nine months promoted Rich Williams to chief executive officer from chief operating officer, and hired a new chief financial officer in the hopes of turning the tide.Management is now “quickly narrowing its product and regional focus to the categories where it can be successful, while deploying marketing dollars to drive growth in North America local deals”, said Samuel Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.Mr Kemp, who upgraded his rating on the company to “overweight”, said Groupon might be able to drive its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation to about 20 per cent above Wall Street’s expectations in 2018.“Groupon excels at the local deal and, we believe, with the new [management] regime focused on maximising the opportunity in deals the company will be able to properly execute its initiative,” he said, adding that “with more rigorous financial and operational standards, we believe that Groupon will also mature into a company that can consistently drive higher rates of capital productivity, leading to shareholder value creation”.Groupon shares rallied 10.5 per cent on Monday to $3.86, cutting the 12-month decline to 24.6 per cent.Shares of Coach were also in the black after an analyst at Baird issued an upbeat note on the fashion brand.Mark Altschwager upgraded the group to “outperform” following the results of a survey suggesting consumer interest in buying Coach handbags has risen from the year prior. In addition, “improving demand among outlet shoppers [still the majority of business] would represent a key catalyst to drive shares higher from here,” he noted.The shares rose 2.5 per cent on Monday to $43.35, extending their year-to-date rise to nearly 32.5 per cent.Elsewhere, an expectation-smashing set of results failed to prevent Hasbro from suffering its biggest one-day drop since October. Shares in the toy maker fell 7 per cent to a three-month low of $79.54 after analysts expressed concerns that the tailwind its all-important boys’ division has been getting from Star Wars products could be fading.Revenues at the unit — Hasbro’s biggest — grew just 4.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 24 per cent in the first.“The slowdown in [the boys’ unit] is somewhat worrisome,” Trevor Young, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,166.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 18,533.1, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.5 per cent to 5,055.8.The S&P 500 rose to within less than one point of the record high it notched last week, as investors shook off anxiety caused by the coup attempt in Turkey, and braced for a number of second-quarter earnings due this week.
46;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-07-18T15:23:20Z;Hasbro drops amid fears of Star Wars sales slowdown;;The force is no longer with Hasbro, it seems.Despite delivering an expectation smashing set of results, shares in the US toy giant tumbled on Monday in their biggest one-day retreat since October.The stock fell more than 7 per cent to a three month low of $79.51 amid concerns that the boost that Hasbro’s all important boys division has been getting from Star Wars products could be fading.Revenues at the unit — Hasbro’s biggest — grew just 4.3 per cent during the second quarter, compared with the 24 per cent growth seen in the first quarter.“The slowdown in Boys is somewhat worrisome,” said Trevor Young, an analyst at Jefferies.Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chief executive said during a call with analysts that demand for Star Wars toys and games remain “very strong”. However, he confirmed that overall Star Wars products sales are expected to be flat this year compared to last year.“Obviously the first couple of quarters, we have been up significantly versus a year ago, but as I said for the full year, we would expect to achieve around the $500m we saw last year,” said Mr Goldner.Indeed, although a new Star Wars film, Rogue One, is slated to hit the theatres in December, analysts say this is a spin off and as such the product boost is unlikely to be as big as those generated by The Force Awakens — which ranks as one of the highest grossing movies of all time.

Neither company has commented, and if such a deal were to be broached there would likely be competition concerns given both groups’ size in the industry.Shares in Hasbro are up nearly 27 per cent so far this year.Image via Getty

Joe Renegades” to “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic”, generated revenues of $244.7m last year, accounting for around 5 per cent of total sales.The move comes as competitors, like Lego, have also found success in creating films and television shows about the toys that they market.Hasbro’s shares were down by 0.9 per cent on Wednesday, holding their losses after the news of the acquisition broke.

Earnings of companies listed on the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector are projected to rise 11.4 per cent year-on-year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That follows 11.5 per cent growth the previous quarter. And it is one of only three sectors on the benchmark index that are projected to post earnings growth.By comparison, earnings of companies listed on the S&P 500 are expected to post an 8.1 per cent decline — its third consecutive quarter of declines — with energy remaining the biggest drag.Meanwhile, overall revenue for the consumer discretionary sector is expected to advance 2.6 per cent — the third biggest gain — compared with projections for a 0.6 per cent decline for the S&P 500.An improving labour market and lower gas prices have helped lift discretionary income benefiting consumer stocks. But with gains from weaker petrol prices expected to dissipate as crude prices have been inching higher, the consumer spending backdrop is expected to become more challenging.And heading into earnings season analysts at JP Morgan recommend avoiding “the most cyclical levered and also the most crowded sector of this recovery,” adding that “any gains should be viewed as an opportunity to reduce exposure”.Hasbro and Netflix kick off earnings season for the consumer discretionary sector next week.
50;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2016-02-08T17:45:59Z;Star Wars film lifts toy sales at Hasbro;Boys segment jumps 35% on back of popular film franchise;The success of the latest Star Wars film boosted fourth-quarter earnings at toymaker Hasbro, with strong sales of figurines and other products associated with the movie franchise.The US group on Monday said revenue from its boys segment, where it counts its Star Wars-related sales, jumped 35 per cent in the final quarter of 2015 to $570m. For the full year, it rose a fifth to $1.78bn.Total sales for the last three months of the year were 13 per cent higher than the same period in 2014 at $1.47bn, while net income rose 3.5 per cent to $175.8m or $1.39 a share.Like other large global companies, Hasbro’s sales and profit were dented by the impact of the strong dollar and slowing emerging markets. International sales rose 3 per cent, though the increase would have been 21 per cent without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Emerging markets revenue fell 7 per cent, though would have been 17 per cent higher excluding currency movements.Expectations of a sales boost from Star Wars-themed merchandise have been high, even months before last December’s release of the latest film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Consumer goods companies — from toymakers to clothes manufacturers and retailers, including Walmart and Target — have all sought to benefit from the popularity of the franchise. According to research company NPD Group sales of Star Wars-licensed merchandise in the US were more than $700m last year.Furby continued to be a drag on sales in the girls segment at Hasbro, due to difficult year-on-year comparisons from a relaunch of the furry electronic robot, and struggling sales of Equestria Girls, the My Little Pony spin-off. Fourth-quarter sales dropped 17 per cent to $259m for the fourth quarter, and sank 22 per cent to $798m for the full year.Hasbro will be hoping to more than offset these declines as it takes over the huge Disney Princess and Frozen franchises from rival Mattel this quarter. Hasbro said that “modest” initial shipments started during the fourth quarter, with products available in the US and being sent to international markets.Mattel has been trying to better compete with Hasbro, which has seen more success with film franchises and children's shift to spending more time on electronic devices. With a chief executive installed early last year, the company has been improving its business practices, reducing costs and trying to make Barbie more relevant — she regained the top spot as American girls’ most wanted gift for Christmas — and it produced strong fourth-quarter earnings. Mattel’s shares have risen 39 per cent in the past six months, compared with Hasbro’s decline of 2.9 per cent, after a rising streak.Mattel’s shares have had a more recent boost from a report that it has been in talks with Hasbro about a potential tie-up. Neither company has commented, and if such a deal were to be broached there would likely be competition concerns given both groups’ size in the industry.

Revenues rose four per cent year-on-year to $4.45bn.Toymakers have faced increasing competition from tablets and other electronic devices. But Hasbro has benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise. It also won the licenses for Disney Princess and Frozen from rival Mattel, which should boost its prospects for the year.The results come days after reports that Hasbro and Mattel were in talks about a merger.Neither company has publicly confirmed the talks, but analysts have said that Mattel’s stronger-than-expected results could have bolstered both investor and management expectations of a turnaround at the retailer and reduced their appetite for a deal. The results also boosted Mattel’s share price, making it more expensive for Hasbro to buy.Moreover, any such deal would give the combined company a nearly 34 per cent share of the US toy market, according to Euromonitor data for 2014, leaving it subject to scrutiny from antitrust regulators.Hasbro shares advanced more than 20 per cent last year.

And the battle to succeed Barack Obama will be a feature of this week. Here’s a brief look at what to watch for.New Hampshire primaryThe political circus has moved to New Hampshire, where voters will go to the polls on Tuesday to have their say on the nominees for the Republicans and the Democrats. Property mogul Donald Trump is the favourite to triumph in the Republican fight, while Bernie Sanders, a senator from neighbouring Vermont, has a commanding lead over Hillary Clinton.Janet Yellen testimonyWith anxiety simmering about the outlook for the US economy, Congressional testimony from Ms Yellen will be closely scrutinised. She is set to appear before a US House of Representatives panel on Wednesday, followed by a Senate committee on Thursday. Should she want to roll back from the Fed’s December projection of four further rate rises this year, the appearances are an opportunity to do so.US consumerConsumption has been one of the bright spots in the US in recent months as other areas of the economy, including the manufacturing and energy sectors, have sputtered.Investors will get a snapshot of how the American consumer fared at the start of the year when the Commerce Department unveils its latest reading on retail sales on Friday. Retail sales are expected to have climbed 0.1 per cent last month from December, when they declined 0.1 per cent. Sales across several categories, including automobiles and general merchandise, picked up steam.A more forward-looking survey from the University of Michigan is expected to show consumer sentiment climbed slightly in February.US earningsMore than 60 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report results as earnings season begins to wind down. Hasbro, Walt Disney, Whole Foods, Twitter, Tesla, TripAdvisor, and Kellogg are on the agenda.

Hasbro, the maker of Play-Doh and board game classics such as Monopoly, rose as much as 4.6 per cent.Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Hasbro has approached Mattel about a possible deal late last year, and the companies have held on-and-off talks.Both Hasbro and Mattel has struggled in recent years as kids increasingly gravitate away from their offerings to spend their playtime with iPad tablets and other electronic devices.Traditional toymakers have also seen their market shares eroded by the explosive popularity of Lego, whose colorful bricks are perceived by parents to have more educational value.But under new chief executive Chris Sinclair, Mattel has taken steps to revive sales of its iconic Barbie dolls. The toy retailer introduced three new body types — tall, curvy and petite — for its Barbie line last month as the company attempts to catch up to changing consumer demands. This comes on top of dolls of various skin tones and hairstyles that it introduced last year.There are signs that the strategy is working. Worldwide Barbie sales rose for the first time in more than 2 years during the fourth quarter, the company said earlier this week when it reported results for its December quarter.Including today’s gains, Mattel is up by more than a third since the start of the year, giving it a market value of around $11.2bn. Hasbro, up 13 per cent so far this year, has a market capitalisation of around $9.1bn.

Sales rose 0.2 per cent to $2bn.Wall Street had forecast earnings of 57 cents a share, on sales of $1.9bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 67 cents a share topped analysts’ forecasts.The company, which saw the resignation of Bryan Stockton chief executive and a 12 per cent drop in its shares last year as it struggled to revive sales, said worldwide Barbie sales rose 1 per cent and were up 8 per cent on a constant currency basis — snapping eight straight quarters of declines. Meanwhile, sales of Hot Wheels were up 26 per cent on a constant currency basis.Chris Sinclair, chief executive, said:We achieved our goal of stabilizing the business, with improved gross sales both in the quarter and for the full year.In addition, we drove significant momentum across the majority of our core brands, most of which saw stronger retail sales and shipping, and we continued to make headway in key emerging markets like China and Russia.Sales of dolls from the Frozen movie franchise had helped offset a decline in Barbie sales in recent years, but with Hasbro nabbing the license to make Frozen and other Disney princess dolls from this year, Mattel has stepped up efforts to revive Barbie sales.The toy retailer introduced three new body types — tall, curvy and petite — for its Barbie line last month as the company attempts to catch up to changing consumer demands. This comes on top of dolls of various skin tones and hairstyles that Mattel introduced last year.Like other toy makers, Mattel is struggling to boost sales as children increasingly turn to tablets and other electronic devices.

This explains the popularity of Pie Face, described as Russian roulette with whipped cream.Players crank a lever according to numbers on a spinner, before a loaded arm splats a custard pie into the unlucky person’s face. It is this year’s best-selling toy in the UK, according to NPD — and there are even reports of it selling out in some parts of the US.After a video of a Scottish man and his grandson playing Pie Face went viral, Hasbro bought the rights to the game — first marketed in the 1960s — under licence from UK-based Rocket Games.James Bond Scalextric by HornbyHornby will be hoping that its James Bond-themed Scalextric set — a revival of its classic slot racing technology — can enthuse a new generation of children.It features technology called ‘app race control’ allowing players to wirelessly manage the race with a handheld device, such as a smartphone or tablet.For the venerable UK maker of model train sets, whose roots date back to Liverpool in 1901, sales of its new Scalextric set will help determine whether it can avoid a fourth profit warning in as many years.Tracy Island Interactive Playset by Vivid ImaginationsAnother blast from the past with new bells and whistles, Tracy Island is the headquarters of International Rescue — the private organisation from the 1960s TV puppet show Thunderbirds, which episodically saved the world by land, sea and air.Tied into a CGI reboot of the sci-fi series, this latest incarnation of the base has added “interactive” elements such as moving parts that open hanger doors for the Thunderbird spacecraft to launch.Its creator, Vivid Imaginations, claims to be Britain’s largest toy company and will be hoping to recreate the success of its Moshi Monsters in prior years, a line of cuddly toys. Its pre-tax profits in 2014 slumped to £0.9m from £4.1m, as sales of the Moshi brand weakened.

Meanwhile, Brent, the international benchmark, sold off by 3.3 per cent to $48.80 a barrel.Among the oil majors, ExxonMobil, the biggest US energy company, dropped 1.8 per cent to $80.99 and fellow blue-chip Chevron fell 1.37 per cent to $90.03.Energy traders eyed data showing China’s economy grew at the weakest pace since 2009 in the third quarter. The country is the world’s second-biggest consumer of petroleum, according to the latest data from the US energy department.Iran also said it planned to bring its oil exports back to pre-sanction levels within months of sanctions being lifted. One of the main reasons oil prices have come under pressure over the past year has been a glut of inventories. Indeed, US crude oil stocks have been running near the highest level in 80 years for this time of the year, the energy department said last week.Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley shares fell 4.8 per cent to $32.31. The US investment bank capped what has been a tough earnings season for the big banks with weaker than expected third-quarter results.James Gorman, the New York-based company’s chief executive, also noted in a conference call that core fixed income trading was the worst since the financial crisis. Other banks, including Goldman Sachs, have also experienced a pronounced decline in revenues from their fixed income trading divisions during the last quarter.Hasbro, the US toymaker, posted stronger than expected quarterly profits. Sales of toys based on the Star Wars and Jurassic World films helped bolster results. However, sales came in slightly short of estimates in the previous quarter due to a stronger US dollar. Company executives said foreign exchange-related woes would probably persist in future quarters.Hasbro shares fell 7.2 per cent to $72.2 by the close, cutting into a year-to-date advance of more than 30 per cent.In the biotech sector, Valeant posted a rise in quarterly sales and profits, and increased its full-year earnings forecast.The shares declined by 7.7 per cent to $163.88.

57;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2015-10-19T16:38:36Z;Force of Star Wars fails to awaken Hasbro earnings;Fall in girls’ toy sales offsets film-driven jump in boys’ toy revenues;"Shares in Hasbro fell more than 7 per cent on Monday after its third-quarter sales narrowly missed analysts’ forecasts, despite strong revenues from boys’ toys ahead of the launch of the latest Star Wars film.Revenues were flat at $1.47bn, just shy of consensus estimates for $1.48bn, while net income rose 15 per cent to $207.6m or $1.64 a share for the quarter ended September 27, the company said in a statement.Hasbro, which has outperformed its larger rival Mattel this year, reported a 24 per cent increase in revenues from its boys segment to $593m, thanks to a strong start to sales of toys linked to Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the Walt Disney film which premieres in mid December. Jurassic World, Marvel and Disney Descendants products also performed well, Hasbro said.Brian Goldner, chief executive, said sales of Star Wars toys were at the “high end” of the company’s expectations.“Consumer takeaway is off to a strong start. The franchise is as vibrant as ever, spanning demographics. Star Wars has the potential to become increasingly global, much as Marvel has become,” Mr Goldner said.However, its girls segment underperformed, with revenues dropping 28 per cent to $295m, driven by a decline in sales of Furby, the furry electronic robot.Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar said the decline in the girls segment reflected a particularly difficult year-on-year comparison, but would become worrying if it continued over the next few quarters. Hasbro relaunched Furby last year, with about 37 per cent of its annual sales coming in the third quarter.Franchise brands such as Monopoly and My Little Pony rose 4 per cent, excluding the negative impact from the strong dollar. Revenue from Transformers was lower following a strong 2014, when the Age of Extinction film was released. Revenue at Hasbro’s games segment dropped 8 per cent to $363m.“We suspect there was some disappointment in the franchise brand performance, with only Nerf, Play-Doh and Monopoly revenues rising in the quarter; [in the] last quarter five of the seven franchise brands grew, and in the first quarter all seven of the franchise brands increased sales,” said Morningstar’s Ms Katz.The ubiquity of tablets and smartphones has transformed the way children play, prompting companies to find increasingly inventive ways to bring physical toys to life onscreen through digital games and apps. Helped by its development of toys based on film franchises, Hasbro has so far seen more success in managing the shift than rival Mattel.The strong dollar hit Hasbro’s sales and profit. Sales would have risen 9 per cent without the hit from currency exchange. Sales in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America were all hit by weak currencies in those regions, but all would have increased excluding the impact of FX.Hasbro shares were down 7.6 per cent at $71.88 at Monday lunchtime in New York, but are still up 31 per cent year-to-date, outpacing Mattel’s 23.4 per cent decline."

Revenue fell 26 per cent to $5.9bn, modestly above expectations for $5.8bn.Adjusting for one-time items, including a charge related to its acquisition of rival Baker Hughes earlier this year, the company reported earnings of 44 cents a share, eclipsing estimates for 29 cents a share.Halliburton, like other energy companies, has come under pressure in the past year as Brent crude remains 50 per cent lower than its peak last year. The company said it has reduced its global headcount by about 16 per cent since the start of the year.Sales in North America, which accounted for 82 per cent of overall revenue last year, declined 39 per cent from a year ago to $2.7bn. Halliburton, however, said margins in the US have come under less pressure than in previous downturns in oil prices, which it attributed to cost cutting.“We believe Halliburton’s second-quarter earnings release has positive implications for the stock,” James Crandell, an analyst at Cowen & Co said. “The earnings outperformance was driven by stronger than expected margins across each geographic region,” he added.The company described the market as “transitional” on Monday but said it will be in good shape to benefit should a recovery come.Shares of Halliburton, which have declined more than 40 per cent in the last year, gained 2 per cent to $40.72.Hasbro shares gained 6 per cent to $83.15, after the US toy maker reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street forecasts helped by sales of merchandise tied to Jurassic World.The company said shipments tied to the movie boosted sales in its boys and pre-school divisions.The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company reported profits of $41.8m or 33 cents a share in the three months ended in June, compared with $33.5m or 26 cents a share in the prior year period.

59;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

However, revenue dropped 3.8 per cent to $797.7m. The company took a $71.5m hit from the strong dollar at its international operations, without which revenue would have increased 5 per cent, Hasbro said.Hasbro has been successful where larger rival Mattel has floundered in past quarters as it has benefited from a strategy of producing merchandise for big film franchises. The monster opening for Jurassic World — the second-biggest debut in cinema history — helped boost demand for its related merchandise for that film, while its results were also bolstered by demand for Nerf toy guns. Demand for Marvel and Star Wars products also increased.In the US and Canada, sales rose 1 per cent to $385.2m thanks to increases in its boys and pre-school segments.However, it was not all fun and games for the company as the strong dollar took its toll on overseas revenues, which dropped to $362.8m in the quarter compared to $396.8m in the year-earlier period, through which it was hit particularly hard in Europe. It also struggled in its girls segment, where revenues slumped 22 per cent to $127.5m, due to poor demand for its Furby owl-like fluffy robot and My Little Pony.“Our second-quarter results came with numerous challenges, including a significant negative foreign exchange impact and difficult year-over-year comparisons in several brands,” said Deborah Thomas, chief financial officer.“We continue to make important investments across our business to promote brand initiatives and to further improve the global efficiency of Hasbro. Some of these investments will be more prominent in the second half of 2015 than they were in the first six months of the year.”Mattel has also been struggling in its business for girls’ toys, where demand for its Barbie doll has been falling. It was also hit by the strong dollar in the second quarter and swung into a loss as its newly installed chief executive Christopher Sinclair works to turn round the company.Shares were trading up 6.3 per cent at $83.14 at lunchtime in New York.

But Taposh Bari, an analyst at Goldman, said the new management has acknowledged “the need to change by returning to a culture rooted in creativity and invention”. The company has “expressed a renewed determination to create blockbuster theatrical content”, they added.“Our underlying thesis is that the “toy industry” is evolving from a legacy vendor model into part of a larger ecosystem integrated with media and technology,” Mr Bari said. He added that Lego, which recently announced dates for three new Lego movies, and Hasbro have adapted well to this change and that Mattel is now catching up.The El Segundo, California-based company has already entered into partnerships with Google, Nickelodeon, DC Entertainment and YouTube this year.Mattel shares, which declined more than 20 per cent in the past year, gained more than 4 per cent to $30.22.Better than expected first-quarter results buoyed shares of Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain.The Seattle-based company reported a 16 per cent rise in profits to $495m, or 33 cents per share, in the three months to the end of March from a year earlier, as traffic at its stores climbed and the company took greater control of its Japanese business.

Barbie purveyor Mattel’s fortunes have sunk in recent years as fewer girls reach for that doll. Barbie sales fell by 12 per cent in 2014, leading to the exit of its chief executive. One explanation for that shortfall — the changing habits of children who simply want to twiddle their thumbs on electronics — looks less persuasive after examining the record of Mattel’s rival Hasbro.Shares in Hasbro, whose line-up includes My Little Pony, Transformers, Monopoly, Nerf, and Play Doh have soared by a third since the beginning of 2014. Build (or partner with) the brands that resonate with kids, and parents will buy both the toys and the heaps of other merchandise that follows in train. They will probably drag the family to the movie, too.In 2014, Hasbro had sales of $4.2bn. It sorts that into seven “franchise” brands; The remainder of the revenue comes from licensing arrangements with partners such as Disney, for which Hasbro makes toys for Star Wars, Marvel and, soon, the smash animated film, Frozen. Similarly, Hasbro has a lucrative arrangement where it earns royalties itself by turning its toy and game brands into video content (think of all those deafening Transformers movies).Hasbro shares trade at 22 times earnings, well ahead of its long-term averages. Its enterprise value of $10bn matches Mattel’s. But the juicy valuation carries risks. Its first-quarter earnings surprise was aided by a one-time revenue jump from a streaming television deal. And while Hasbro has taken advantage of the growing middle classes around the world — international revenue was up a fifth on a constant currency basis — the strong dollar meant reported international revenue growth was flat. Hasbro has captured the fancy of kids. But kids, like investors, can be fickle.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Excluding a tax benefit in the year earlier quarter, Hasbro said net earnings increased 43 per cent.Sales of toys for boys climbed 10 per cent from a year earlier, lifted by growth of Transformers and Marvel franchised products, while its games and puzzle business recorded a 7 per cent rise in revenues.“2015 is off to a good start with continued momentum in our business, led by growth in all of our franchise brands and the underlying strength in demand across international markets, including the emerging markets,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro chief executive.Halliburton shares advanced on Monday after the oil services behemoth eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations and executives said the company had cut 10 per cent of its headcount in the past two quarters.The company slipped to a loss of $643m, or 76 cents per share, in the three months to the end of March, as sales fell 4 per cent to $7.1bn. Halliburton took approximately $823m in charges to write down assets and restructure its business as a slide in crude prices weighs on the oil industry.Adjusting for some items, Halliburton said earnings from operations was 49 cents a share, ahead of analyst forecasts for 36 cents per share. Halliburton shares climbed 2 per cent to $47.85.Royal Caribbean shares declined 8 per cent to $72.70 after the world’s second-largest cruise operator cut its earnings guidance on the strength of the US dollar and a rise in fuel prices since January.The company now expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $4.45 and $4.65, 20 cents lower than previous forecasts. Analysts on Wall Street had projected adjusted earnings of $4.70 a share ahead of the announcement.Michael Kors shares slipped 2 per cent to $62.16 after analysts with Mizuho Securities downgraded the retailer to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ following a survey by the brokerage that showed a rise in the number of consumers who find its products too ubiquitous.“Survey respondents increasingly cited disinterest because the brand was ‘too common’ and ‘lacked fashion newness’ that may substantiate investor concerns of saturation in North America,” Betty Chen, an analyst with Mizuho, said.The US retailer has come under pressure from shareholders who are concerned that the company’s brisk expansion and strong same-store sales figures could decelerate.Overall, US equities started the week on a strong footing, rebounding from a sharp sell-off on Friday. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,100.40 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 18,034.93. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 4,994.60.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
64;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2015-04-03T20:20:07Z;The List: Monopoly’s hidden history;Unsung pioneers behind the board game’s development;"Monopoly-maker Hasbro has been trumpeting the 80th anniversary of the board game. However, there could be 111 candles on the birthday cake, as its roots can be traced to the Landlord’s Game, an older version from 1904. Mary Pilon chooses some of the lesser-known people who have influenced the game’s history.Now a relative obscurity on the political landscape, Henry George electrified followers in the 1800s with talk of his “land value tax” or “single tax”. He argued that individuals should own 100 per cent of what they created but that nature, particularly land, should belong to everyone. He believed that if all taxes were eradicated except for the one on property, poverty levels would diminish. His 1879 book, Progress and Poverty, reportedly sold more copies than any book except the Bible and he regularly spoke to sold-out halls, unaware that his philosophy would result in one of the most successful board games of all time.In 1904, an outspoken feminist and follower of George living in the Washington DC area received a patent for her Landlord’s Game. Originally designed as a teaching tool to show the evils of monopolies, Lizzie Magie reportedly received $500 and no royalties for her creation, which spread across the US, becoming popular among leftwing intellectuals. Magie also published poetry and short stories and worked as a stenographer. She died a widow with no children, her contributions to the game lost for decades.One of the groups who embraced the folk spin-off of the Landlord’s Game were the Quakers of Atlantic City. Often calling it “the Monopoly Game”, a network of Quaker teachers regularly hosted game nights. They localised the board to reflect their town, and realtor Jesse Raiford assigned it property values. Revering silence, the Quakers reduced the role of auctions and made it simpler for children. Charles Darrow, an unemployed Philadelphia salesman, learnt a version of this game from a friend and sold it to Parker Brothers, a New England toy company.The true history of Monopoly would be buried, were it not for an economics professor living in Berkeley in the 1970s. Upset by its values, Ralph Anspach designed his own Anti-Monopoly game. There followed a decade-long legal battle with Parker Brothers, in which Anspach would unearth the game’s origins and fight to the steps of the Supreme Court in 1983. He eventually won the right to make Anti-Monopoly games.Mary Pilon is the author of ‘The Monopolists’ (Bloomsbury)Photographs: Dreamstime; Casey E Martin"
65;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2015-03-02T06:52:29Z;Developers see the future of games on smaller mobile screens;Consoles are being supplanted by mobile devices;When King Digital Entertainment launched its eagerly awaited follow-up to the popular mobile game Candy Crush Saga, it looked far beyond Apple’s App Store to promote it.Videos heralding the arrival of the Candy Crush Soda Saga blitzed 100m Facebook newsfeeds in a single day. TV spots aired in 20 countries and digital billboards were flooded with fizzy bubbles around the globe.The multimillion-dollar launch illustrates that mobile gaming is no longer a poor relation of video games. Newzoo, a research company, forecasts that the mobile games industry, which it says has predicted global revenues of $30.3bn in 2015, is poised to overtake console games sales for the first time.Underlining the transition, Newzoo said in a report that Apple’s forecast $4bn in gaming revenues — made from just hosting and selling other developers’ games, for which it takes a 30 per cent cut — is likely to be almost double Nintendo’s sales this year.As mobile games have increased in sophistication, growing numbers of players spend many hours — and dollars — on addictive titles such as Clash of Clans, Minecraft and Game of War: Fire Age.“The first wave of mobile games was simplistic — the gameplay was there but the polish wasn’t,” says Julian Farrior, chief executive of Backflip Studios, the mobile gaming company behind DragonVale and Seabeard, which is now majority owned by toymaker Hasbro.But, Mr Farrior adds: “Over time, the polish has increased, the budget has increased and revenue expectations have increased.”In the App Store’s early days, barriers to entry were low. But, as it has become harder to be noticed in an overcrowded market, promoting and distributing a hit game has become an expensive but important part of the marketing mix.“It’s a very competitive market,” says Riccardo Zacconi, King Digital’s chief executive. “The ‘top grossing’ charts are very stable. It’s a handful of developers there and the conditions for succeeding are very hard.”Despite this, King’s marketing drove Soda Saga to the top of Apple and Google’s app download charts globally for November. In its earnings report, King said it set a new quarterly record of 1.5bn average daily game plays in the three months to December.But King has an advantage other games makers do not. As well as the external advertising, many people downloading Soda Saga did so because they saw an ad in the original Candy Crush game, which has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times.Electronic Arts, a veteran console games maker, has franchises that are just as well known as King’s, including John Madden NFL football and Fifa Soccer. Even so, EA is only just starting to find its feet in mobile.Andrew Wilson, EA’s chief executive, says the company had a “breakout performance” in mobile over Christmas, generating a “record” $121m in sales, up 25 per cent over the prior year.Its rival, Activision Blizzard, whose Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises have dominated console and PC gaming, has been even slower to mobile.In late 2013, Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, said there was nothing that had driven any sizeable amount of operating profit in mobile gaming. But in its recent earnings call, Activision’s chiefs admitted mobile and tablet gaming had “moved up on our priority list” after finding success with a Warcraft spin-off, Hearthstone.Activision’s chiefs now say mobile gaming has ‘moved up’ their priority listIn the console world, developers create games and leave it to publishers, such as EA and Activision, to work with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo on distribution. Mobile games are usually free, with revenue generated from ads or in-app sales.“When you’re thinking about that transition, it isn’t wholly intuitive to console developers who are reliant on publishers for distribution,” says Mr Farrior. “In mobile, you own the distribution and the development of the piece. That’s . . . outside the comfort zone for traditional publishers.”Another challenge for console developers is that mobile games are created and updated very differently. Console games are typically left unchanged, but mobile games, once on a device, can be updated almost constantly.King, for example, adjusts the difficulty of Soda Saga’s levels every few weeks. The first “cohort” of players was looking for something more difficult than the original Candy Crush, Mr Zacconi says, while newer players want something easier.Despite the different dynamics, Mr Farrior says mobile studios such as Backflip are hiring console games developers in much greater numbers. “We’ve had to hire truly talented experience, and the bulk of that experience was in shifting from console to mobile.”Backflip is planning to use Hasbro’s brands and characters to help its games stand out. But even names that could include My Little Pony and Transformers are not enough to guarantee a hit in the mobile gaming world, Mr Farrior says.“A brand is important, but a brand alone won’t get you there,” he says.To succeed, he says, you need an “absolutely killer game”, with high retention and conversion from free downloads to paying customers. “You need to marry the good math with the good brand and have a really talented, aggressive user acquisition team.”

These conditions have been exacerbated by weak demand. Meanwhile, aluminium premiums, which represent the cost of physically delivering the metal to the buyer, are also expected to decline.“While Alcoa’s efforts over the past several years to reduce its costs in the upstream and grow its downstream should help to offset some of the these pressures, we think a neutral rating is warranted given the downside risk to the stock given just how much aluminium premiums have increased over the past several years,” Michael Gambardella, an analyst at JPMorgan, said.Mr Gambardella did add that Alcoa was in a better position to deal with lower aluminium premiums and prices than it was several years ago.Last month, Alcoa said it expected sustained growth in aluminium from demand in the automotive and aerospace industries.Alcoa shares, which have gained 40 per cent in the past year, declined 6 per cent to $15.65.Better than expected fourth-quarter profits and a new buyback programme pushed shares of toymaker Hasbro up 7 per cent to $59.66.The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company reported a profit of $169.9m, or $1.34 a share, in the three months ended in December, compared with $129.8m, or 98 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 1 per cent to $1.29bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.20 a share, on sales of $1.33bn.Hasbro’s board authorised a $500m share buyback programme, on top of a $64.2m programme that was available at year-end.Shares of McDonald’s declined more than 1 per cent to $92.72, after the fast food restaurant chain reported a 1.8 per cent decline in global same-store sales in January, steeper than the 1.2 per cent decline that Wall Street analysts had forecast.Energy was the best performing sector on the S&P 500 as Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, climbed nearly 1 per cent to $58.34 a barrel.Transocean was the best performing energy stock on the US benchmark, advancing 10 per cent to $20.44, while shares of Noble Corp gained 6 per cent to $19.28.The S&P 500 declined 0.4 per cent to 2,046.74, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5 per cent to 17,729.21.

It will incur an additional $80m-$100m non-cash charge based on a valuation of deferred tax assets, offset by a decrease in payments due to Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder — and a former DWA shareholder.Senior management is also being reshuffled. Mark Zoradi, DWA’s chief operating officer, will leave the company after only seven months in the job while Dawn Taubin, its chief marketing executive, is also departing after less than two years.DWA has recently flirted with two potential buyers, exploring sales to SoftBank, the Japanese technology group founded by Masayoshi Son, and Hasbro, the leading toymaker. But after negotiations with each buyer reached an advanced stage the deals fell apart.DWA is closing an animation facility in Redwood City in northern California as part of the restructuring. “We are restructuring this business to focus our talents and resources,” said Mr Katzenberg.He declined to comment on whether the company was involved in other sale negotiations but said: “I remain 1000 per cent committed to DWA . . . my efforts in the last couple of years have been spent on expanding the company. It’s now time to turn my attention back to our core business.”DWA expects to generate $30m in pre-tax cost savings in 2015, rising to approximately $60m by 2017 following the restructuring.DWA was spun out of DreamWorks, the studio started by David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Mr Katzenberg, in 2004. Mr Katzenberg, DWA’s chief executive — and one of US President Barack Obama’s biggest fundraisers— has actively sought a buyer on multiple occasions over the past few years.The company has scored some of Hollywood’s biggest animated hits and has blazed a trail in China, striking a deal to build a $2.4bn entertainment complex in Shanghai and forming a joint venture with three state-owned media companies to produce film and television series in the country.However, it has also suffered its share of missteps, taking writedowns on three of its recent films: Rise of the Guardians, Turbo and Mr Peabody and Sherman.

Sales slipped 0.5 per cent to $2.76bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for a net loss of $258.9m, on sales of $2.82bn.“Like most retailers, following a strong start to the back-to-school season, sales did slow in September and October as unseasonably warm weather hindered the sale of fall goods,” Mike Ullman, chief executive, said.In 2012, the company brought in Ron Johnson from Apple and named him chief executive. Mr Johnson shifted the company’s strategy away from promotions and instead focused on fair pricing, but this caused same-store sales to fall. The company then brought back Mr Ullman to head the company.“Mr Ullman returned JC Penney to many of its previous competitive pricing and promotional strategies; however, there could be a long road ahead, in our view, given the significant market share lost during 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013,” Robert Drbul, an analyst at Nomura, said.JC Penney shares fell 9 per cent to $7.10 and are down 22 per cent so far this year.Kohl’s shares fell nearly 3 per cent to $56.07, after the retailer missed third-quarter earnings and sales expectations.Net sales for the three months to the end of September fell 1.6 per cent to $4.37bn. Net income was down 20 per cent at $142m, or 70 cents a share.Analysts had forecast net income of 74 cents a share on revenues of $4.39bn.Several mid-tier retailers have struggled to entice middle class consumers to shop despite lower gasoline prices and promotions.

But those talks fell apart, leading to Hasbro’s emergence as a possible buyer.DWA and Hasbro have agreed the basic outline of a deal with the price likely to exceed $30 a share – a 35 per cent premium to DWA’s closing price on Wednesday – according to a person close to the situation. The company has a market capitalisation of $1.9bn.However, the person cautioned that discussions were at a preliminary stage.The prospective deal would combine DWA’s Hollywood production assets and film library with a toy and consumer products group that has a rich library of intellectual property.Hollywood studios have plundered toy brands for movie ideas in recent years: some, such as Transformers, have become profitable franchises, generating billions of dollars, while others, such as Battleship, were box office flops.DWA was spun out of DreamWorks, the studio started by David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, in 2004. Mr Katzenberg, DWA’s chief executive – and one of US President Barack Obama’s biggest fundraisers – has actively sought a buyer on multiple occasions over the past few years.Mr Katzenberg would remain with DWA, assuming a deal goes ahead, said a person familiar with the matter.DWA has scored some of Hollywood’s biggest animated hits and has blazed a trail in China, striking a deal to build a $2.4bn entertainment complex in Shanghai and forming a joint venture with three state-owned media companies to produce film and television series in the country.It has also suffered its share of missteps, taking writedowns on three of its recent films: Rise of the Guardians, Turbo and Mr Peabody and Sherman.The company has also moved into digital distribution, acquiring AwesomenessTV, a YouTube network that produces and aggregates programming for children.Hasbro, meanwhile, has diversified beyond its core toy business. The company struck a partnership in 2010 with Discovery Communications to create a cable channel – The Hub – aimed at children.The channel was recently rebranded Discovery Family Channel, with Discovery providing more programming in evening hours, although Hasbro has retained its stake in the venture.News of the talks between Hasbro and DWA was first reported by the Deadline website.
70;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2014-10-09T18:32:40Z;Could Best Fiends achieve what Angry Birds hasn’t?;;Angry Birds may be in free fall but two of the executives most responsible for its success are spreading their wings.Just days after the company behind Angry Birds cut 16 per cent of its workforce amid disappointing growth, two former Rovio executives are launching their first game backed with $5m of venture capital money.Andrew Stalbow, former head of strategic partnerships at Rovio and now chief executive at Seriously, said he hoped Thursday’s launch of Best Fiends would be the start of creating a mobile phone-centred entertainment brand.The company’s co-founder is Petri Järvilehto, former head of games at Rovio , and the puzzle game they have unveiled involves cute bugs destroying slugs. It was created in Helsinki using the same artist who drew Angry Birds.“Audiences have moved to mobile devices far quicker than anyone in the entertainment industry expected,” Mr Stalbow, who was responsible for signing deals with Lucasfilm and Hasbro at Rovio, told the Financial Times.At the same time as the game is being launched for Apple’s devices, the soundtrack – written by the composer behind the animation film Despicable Me – will be released on iTunes while a series of short videos will appear on YouTube.A release for devices running Google’s Android operating system will follow later this year.Seriously’s approach to creating something more than a game resembles that of Rovio’s with a crucial difference: the start-up is embracing so-called freemium games from the start.Rovio had major success with Angry Birds when players paid a small fee to download the game but has struggled to make the transition to freemium games, which are free to play but where speeding up the game or making it easier costs money. Its revenue growth stalled last year.Mr Stalbow, however, was bullish about the possibilities for Seriously, arguing that it was “pretty early days in a very big shift” in entertainment consumption towards mobile.“I see huge amounts of Hollywood talent coming to mobile and games of higher and higher quality,” he added, pointing to a Kim Kardashian game topping the app charts earlier this year.Best Fiends is only the latest well-backed game to be released from Finland, home to Supercell, developer of Clash of Clans and Hay Day, two of the most popular mobile titles ever. “Finland really is in many ways the mobile games capital of the world in the same way as LA is the entertainment capital of the world,” Mr Stalbow said.Mr Stalbow said a cartoon series or film could follow if Best Fiends is a success but that nothing was currently under development. Angry Birds is due to unveil its first feature film in 2016.

Profits declined 22 per cent from a year earlier to $425m, or 58 cents per share. Excluding some expenses, the bank said its earnings per share would have been 70 cents, short of analyst expectations.The company blamed higher personnel expenses for the weaker than anticipated results.Nonetheless, the bank said it was aided by a 7.2 per cent rise in annualised loan activity from a quarter earlier, including a bump in commercial and industrial loans.The results weighed on the wider sector as BB&T shares slipped 4 per cent to $37.33, leading the benchmark S&P 500 lower. SunTrust Banks declined 1 per cent to $39.28, BankUnited slid 1 per cent to $32.30 and PNC remained unchanged by close of trading at $83.88.Yum Brands, the operator of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined after the Shanghai food safety watchdog said it had closed a poultry processor that supplies some of its outlets.The move followed an undercover investigation by a local television station that found the processor to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, apologised to their Chinese customers.China remains central to Yum’s business, accounting for more than half of the company’s overall sales last year. Shares of Yum fell 4 per cent to $74.13 while McDonald’s slid 1 per cent to $97.55.Botox maker Allergan advanced 2 per cent to $171.14 after it said it would cut 1,500 jobs, or 13 per cent of its staff.A reduction in headcount comes during Allergan’s three-month, $50bn takeover battle with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose takeover advances it has rebuffed since they were first made in April.Valeant, whose bid is supported by Allergan’s largest shareholder, Wall Street hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, has sought to portray Allergan as saddled with inefficiencies and having a bloated cost structure.Allergan described the cuts as part of an “ongoing effort to improve efficiency and productivity”.It will take a charge of between $375m and $425m to pay for severance costs. Valeant shares rose 3 per cent to $125.54.Toymaker Hasbro was under pressure after it missed Wall Street quarterly sales expectations, despite an 8 per cent rise in sales.The company said revenues were lifted by rising Marvel and Transformer toys, offset somewhat by a dip in game sales.Hasbro shares fell 3 per cent to $51.78 while rival Mattel declined 1 per cent to $35.96.Overall, equity markets trended lower as geopolitical tensions continued to ferment with US President Barack Obama calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ensure that investigators have full access to the site of the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed in Ukraine last week.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,973.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 per cent to 17,051.73.

Analysts had forecast a decline of 1.6 per cent.The company, which generated 43 per cent of its operating profit last year from the US, said sales were better abroad.Comparable sales rose 2 per cent in Europe, as improvements in the underlying economies of the UK and Russia lifted overall results. McDonald’s said company-wide same-store sales climbed 1.2 per cent during the month.Chief executive Don Thompson continues to overhaul the fast-food chain’s menu and is cutting prices to better compete with rivals Wendy’s and Burger King.Shares in McDonald’s had slipped just over 1 per cent by the close of trading to $94.85.Apple shares rose 1.79 per cent to $528.99 in New York after activist investor Carl Icahn dropped a proposal demanding the iPhone maker buy back another $50bn worth of its shares this year.Apple investors were due to vote on the plan, which was nonbinding, at the Silicon Valley company’s annual meeting on February 28.The withdrawal of the demand comes 24 hours after Institutional Shareholder Services, a company that advises US institutions on how to vote on such proposals, urged investors to vote against Mr Icahn’s plan.Mr Icahn said he was heartened after Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, last week disclosed that the company had bought back $14bn of shares since the end of January.US toymaker Hasbro rallied 4.5 per cent to $52.36 after its executives said they were seeing “momentum” in a number of divisions on a call with analysts, even as sales disappointed over the key holiday period.The company said sales were little changed from year-ago levels at $1.3bn, while profits declined less than 1 per cent to $129m, or 98 cents per diluted share. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.22 per share on sales of $1.3bn.“We are better positioned today to align our business towards delivering long-term profitable growth,” chief executive Brian Goldner said. “Importantly, we are seeing positive momentum in the areas of our heightened focus, our franchise brands.”Timothy Conder, an analyst at Wells Fargo, noted that gains in the pre-school market, as well as the company’s steady capital return programme, was a positive for investors.An upgrade to overweight at investment bank Morgan Stanley elevated shares of American Express on Monday.Analyst Betsy Graseck said new measures from the company to increase merchant acceptance of its cards could lift sales by $6bn to $16bn between 2015 and 2016. American Express, which is welcomed at fewer businesses than peer Visa, is at work to close that gap.Ms Graseck added that rising economic expectations in the US were likely to boost American Express cardholder spending.“Higher housing and stock market valuations disproportionately benefit Amex’s affluent customers,” Ms Graseck said. “We estimate 10 to 11 per cent spending growth; this is conservative in the context of the historical relationship of spending to real GDP growth.”American Express rose 1.5 per cent to $88.34.US equity markets drifted lower on Monday, following a 2.6 per cent two-day rally on the benchmark S&P 500 at the end of last week.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,799.84 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged upwards to 15,801.79.

Toys marketed to girls (Mattel’s Barbie, American Girl, Monster High and Hasbro’s My Little Pony) drove better than expected earnings at both.Emerging market growth helped the results, too. But the US remains the largest toy market and there, besieged by video games and smartphones (where the boys seem to be spending their time), Mattel and Hasbro now resemble movie studios: they depend on hits to grow.Weak overall top lines at Mattel and Hasbro show how fractured their businesses have become. Mattel expanded third-quarter revenue 6 per cent; Hasbro, 2 per cent. But Barbie sales were up 3 per cent after revenue declines in the previous five quarters. Monster High and American Girl were both up over 20 per cent. The Girls segment at Hasbro was up 29 per cent.While Monster High and American Girl are hits, Mattel is already looking to a new franchise called Even After High. At Hasbro the hope is its boys’ line will rally next year with toys tied to the Transformers and Marvel comic films.Hasbro’s total return to shareholders this year has been 40 per cent and Mattel’s is 20 per cent; so far, both have managed weak overall sales growth using tight expense control and capital returns to shareholders. There is cautious optimism about the holiday quarter, though both noted that retailers have tightened inventories (both companies have essentially the same inventory balance as a year ago). Hasbro trades at 16 times forward earnings, while Mattel is at 15 times. The slight premium for Hasbro probably comes from its ties to the franchise action films that hit next year. Making a hit from scratch is hard. With toys as with movies, it’s safer to bet on a sequel.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

Shares of Hasbro were up 38.5 per cent on the year to date.Shares in VF Corp rose after the clothing producer reported sales that rose 4.7 per cent, but missed analyst estimates. Lower materials costs and a shift to more profitable businesses helped the company beat earnings per share estimates.VF said it expected a “strong finish” to the year even though industry analysts have declared concern on slow mall traffic and poor consumer confidence. Shares in the group were up 3.4 per cent to $211.25.Hasbro and VF helped overcome weakness elsewhere in the consumer discretionary sector, which was up 0.2 per cent.Gannett shares were off 2.2 per cent to $26.90 after it missed earnings estimates. The media group said revenue fell 4.3 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2012.Goodyear Tire and Rubber lost 6.7 per cent to $21.12 after it was downgraded by Deutsche Bank to “hold” from “buy”.The S&P 500 moved fractionally higher on the day to a fresh record close of 1,744.66. The index was led by a 1.2 per cent rise in the telecoms sector as AT&T moved higher.Shares in the US’s largest telecoms company added 1.8 per cent to $35.22 after it announced the sale of its cell towers to Crown Castle International for $4.9bn.Crown Castle dropped 1.7 per cent to $74.66.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1 per cent to 15,392.20.Apple shares gained 2.5 per cent to $521.36 ahead of its iPad event on Tuesday. The iPhone maker was upgraded by Société Générale to “buy” from “hold”.The Nasdaq Composite index, on which Apple is the most heavily weighted stock, gained 0.2 per cent to 3,920.05.Casino operator Caesars Entertainment was down 4.8 per cent to $17.81 on news that an investigation from gaming authorities had caused the company to withdraw its bid to build a new casino in Massachusetts.McDonald’s shares were off 0.6 per cent to $94.59 after the restaurant chain reported earnings per share that narrowly beat expectations but fell short of revenue estimates.Milk formula maker Mead Johnson gained 2 per cent to $80.41 after Citigroup upgraded the company to “buy” from “neutral”, noting the group had increased its market share in China.Priceline gained 3.7 per cent to $1,087.09 after investment bank Susquehanna raised its price target on the company to $1,200 from $1,135.The day’s mixed trading left the S&P 500 up 3.8 per cent in October.The Nasdaq is 3.9 per cent higher in the same time period. However, the Dow is up only 1.7 per cent on the month as stocks with higher dividend yields lagged behind the recent rally that drove the S&P to a record high.Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said in a note that higher yielding stocks that missed out on the recent rally were set for near-term strength.Fallout from the government shutdown could extend the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programme. The longer the programme, the longer interest rates stay low, which is beneficial for higher yielding blue-chip stocks.“With Congress now kicking the decision can down the road to January and February, tapering is not expected by the consensus now to start until the March FOMC meeting. So that gives us basically five months in which to frolic in this still low interest rate environment,” Mr Stovall said.But recent mixed movements by high yielding stocks show that although low rates make for a buying opportunity, it is still important to pick stocks on merit, Mr Stovall said.“Do not just buy any of them thinking they will go to their pre-May levels, but put some sort of an overlay on there because as we saw from [October] 15 through 18, not all high yielding boats rose by an equivalent amount,” he said.
75;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2013-06-17T22:53:37Z;Retail: Baby boom is a windfall for children’s products;Russia’s leading toys and games seller is so sure of its future that it is to make its own branded goods;A line of cots draped in white organza fills the window of a Detsky Mir (Children’s World) store on a dusty highway in north Moscow, a mock baby dormitory that conjures up the romance of motherhood.Rising living standards, together with an uptick in the birth rate, are breathing new life into the Russian market for children’s goods. Retailers such as Detsky Mir are reaping the benefits, and revenues from the sale of children’s toys, games, clothes and other kids’ paraphernalia are rising by 10-15 per cent a year – far outpacing growth in most other consumer segments.Detsky Mir was founded in the 1950s, when the Soviet authorities opened a children’s goods emporium in Moscow that, despite its chilling location next to the KGB headquarters on Lubyanka Square, was intended to showcase the happiness of growing up in the world’s first communist state.After the Soviet Union dissolved, Detsky Mir was acquired by Sistema, an investment group founded by Russian oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov.Although it no longer owns the original Moscow store, Detsky Mir is still Russia’s biggest and best-known children’s goods brand, with an approximate 7 per cent share of the market.Russia’s birth rate has been rising as women born during a Soviet baby boom in the 1980s reach reproductive age. The Kremlin is campaigning to boost the population, and has offered cash incentives to encourage couples to have bigger families. Mothers bearing a second child receive a $10,000 bonus that can be spent on education and buying or improving a house.More babies were born in Russia in 2012 than in any year for the past two decades, says Chris Baxter, senior vice-president of Sistema. “The cots in Detsky Mir’s window were put there on purpose. We’re pushing the baby products very successfully.”Rising salaries and the increasing availability of consumer credit have boosted the spending power of Russia’s new middle class. Although a slowdown in Russian economic growth that began last year has skimmed some of the froth from the retail market, sales of children’s goods have been unaffected. “As people enter the realm where they have some disposable income, one of the first things they do is indulge their children,” says Mr Baxter. Russia’s rising birth rate promises positive future potential.Turning round a Rbs217m loss in 2011, Detsky Mir reported net profits of Rbs456m in 2012 on the back of Rbs27.75bn of revenues. Sistema is confident enough about the future of the children’s goods market to begin planning to take Detsky Mir public. “We see an excellent opportunity to grow the company further and quickly, with a view to a potential IPO in 2015,” says Mr Baxter.Russian shoppers have a reputation for wild extravagance, but Detsky Mir, rather than targeting wealthy yummy mummies, is focused on the price-sensitive middle of the market. Russians tend to start families earlier than in western countries. Detsky Mir’s average customer is a mother aged 24-25, with a family income of Rbs30,000-Rbs40,000 ($1,000-$1,333) a month.Detsky Mir stocks a wide range of children’s toys and games produced by leading international manufacturers such as Lego – Russia’s favourite toy, according to Euromonitor – as well as Hasbro and Mattel.The acquisition of the Early Learning Centre (ELC) under a franchise agreement with the UK’s Mothercare last year has provided a foothold in the market for the educational toys favoured by many Russian parents. Detsky Mir’s strategy is to develop its own branded toys and games to increase sales margins and ensure customer loyalty, says Mr Baxter.Sistema sold Sistema Gals, its indebted real estate subsidiary to VTB, the Russian state bank, during the global financial crisis, thereby losing control of the original Detsky Mir store on Lyubanka Square.Sistema Gals is investing $230m to renovate the grandiose building, and looking for anchor tenants. Hamleys, the legendary UK toy retailer, which opened its first Moscow store last year, has shown interest.Detsky Mir has about 40 outlets in Moscow, but is struggling to find a suitable site in the capital for a new flagship store. Russian and international retailers are in a hurry to expand in Moscow, and there’s not enough prime shopping space to go around, says Polina Zhilkina director of the strategy consulting department at the Russian office of CBRE, the international commercial property and real estate services company. Rents in prime Moscow malls are rising, and are now comparable to major European capitals. “Everyone wants to open a flagship store.”Moscow’s children’s goods market is approaching saturation, and the best opportunities for growth lie in the Russian regions. After doubling the size of its network in the past two years, Detsky Mir now operates 216 stores – including 20 ELC franchise outlets – spread across 96 cities in Russia and Kazakhstan. There are plans to add 40 more stores this year.E-commerce is chipping away at conventional retailers’ margins as more Russians are hooking up to the internet. In a move to counter online competitors, Detsky Mir has launched its own e-stores at detmir.ru and elc-russia.ru.
76;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2013-02-21T11:28:37Z;Lego moves up toymaker ranks;;Lego has become the world’s second-biggest toymaker by sales after the Danish group defied the gloom in the sector to increase its sales by a quarter in 2012.The maker of billions of coloured toy bricks every year has almost tripled its sales since 2007 as it has brushed off the impact of the global financial crisis and bucked the trend towards digital devices such as the iPad.The privately owned toymaker recorded sales of DKr23.4bn ($4.14bn) last year against $4.09bn for Hasbro, the previous number two behind market leader Mattel.Hasbro, the maker of Transformers, My Little Pony and Play-Doh, has increased sales by just 7 per cent since 2007, and last year they fell 5 per cent.“What matters to us is to be the best, not the biggest. We want to be the best playing experience for children, the best supplier to our retailers and the best employer,” Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, chief executive, told the Financial Times. He added that on Lego’s own calculations – using the average exchange rate for 2012 – it remained slightly behind Hasbro.Lego also increased its operating profits by 29 per cent to DKr8bn as its new but controversial range of Friends building sets – designed to appeal to girls – sold well alongside ranges such as City, Star Wars and Ninjago.Mr Knudstorp credited Lego’s high-selling video games and website with helping the company to engage with children in the digital age, but added that physical play was still important.“A child needs physical activity. They can’t sit still – their physiology forces them to move . . . We think that physical toys such as Lego will be around for a long time,” he said.The 80-year-old company used to be under-represented in big toy markets such as North America and the UK, but it has pushed to increase sales in the US, which is now its biggest market. It is also looking to expand into Russia, Latin America and Asia as the middle classes swell in emerging markets.Lego – which is 75 per cent owned by an investment vehicle belonging to the founder’s family and 25 per cent by the Lego Foundation – paid out a dividend of DKr14.6m per share in 2012, up 20 per cent. Mr Knudstorp said Lego only kept cash needed for operating purposes but otherwise gave it to the family to invest elsewhere. “If Lego needs [the cash] it flows back,” he added.As it shifts its production to low-cost countries, Lego is building a new factory in Hungary and expanding one in the Czech Republic. It recently announced that it is to close its packing facilities at its Billund headquarters in the next two and a half years, but is investing in its moulding and engineering works there.Lego said it expected sales to increase in 2013, but not at the pace they did in 2012 because of the challenging global economic situation.
77;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2012-12-23T17:59:32Z;Toymakers tremble as tots turn to tablets;;Step aside Barbie. The hottest gift for children this holiday season is not going to be a doll or a toy truck. It’s a tablet.Whether a new Kindle Fire, or a hand-me-down iPad, analysts predict 2012 will be the year children as young as three-years-old will unwrap tablets at trendsetting rates. And that has the traditional toy companies scrambling to stay relevant.“The top two guys, Mattel and Hasbro, they are terrified,” said Sean McGowan, managing director of equity research at Needham & Company, an investment banking firm. “They should be terrified, but the official party line is they’re not terrified.”Toy companies have seen the trend coming, but have struggled to adapt to the new environment quickly.At Mattel, the largest toymaker by revenues, its number-one selling product this year is a plastic cellphone case, said a person familiar with the company’s sales, raising concern about the fate of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars.Some analysts are lowering their forecasts for fourth-quarter toy sales, currently estimated at $1.41bn for Hasbro and $2.29bn for Mattel, after sales in the first three quarters of the year declined compared to the year before.The main danger for toy and board game makers is not just that their physical products are being displaced, but the amount of time children are spending with technology devices has skyrocketed. They watch free content online and play free video games for hours on end.In the last year, the image of a toddler trying to swipe a print magazine page like a tablet has become a real-life viral meme. Now that parents are likely to upgrade their own devices to the new Apple iPad mini or another of the various gadgets released for Christmas, many will be more than willing to pass their old one on to their children.“Everyone I know who has a kid under 10 has a tablet in the house. And that tablet is the babysitter,” said Dylan Collins, an investor in Fight My Monster, an online gaming company.Up against tech companies that make such engaging entertainment, the toymakers cannot compete, Mr McGowan said.Mattel almost went bankrupt in the 1980s from its attempt to move into video games, he said. Hasbro, which makes popular board games like Monopoly and Scrabble, has been outpaced on several fronts by Zynga, the social gaming company built on Facebook.“Clearly, young people have an aptitude for and expectation with digital platforms that we need to recognise,” said John Frascotti, chief marketing officer for Hasbro.This Christmas, the company has high hopes for the reinvention of its popular 1990s plush toy, Furby. The new interactive version comes with a free mobile app that kids can use to feed Furby, and translate the things it says in “Furbish” to English. The toy is also built with artificial intelligence, so its behaviour changes depending on how it is treated, whether its tail is pulled or it is tickled.Mattel did not comment.
78;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2012-08-31T14:34:26Z;Lego – beyond bricks;Toymaker builds on solid foundations with first-half earnings up by one third;Build your own (or get your children to do it for you) and you will prosper. That may be the secret of Scandinavian business success. Alongside Sweden’s Ikea, Denmark’s Lego makes tons of money by exploiting the universal obsession with assembling things. Earnings at the family-owned company in the first six months of 2012 were one third higher than a year ago. Sales were $1.5bn, or the equivalent of 12bn Lego bricks – six for every child on the planet.That was good work in an environment where competitors such as Mattel and Hasbro, known for Barbie and Transformers, are finding the going tough. Lego is not messing about. Its first-half performance was helped by tapping into the hearts and minds of little girls, generally underserved by toymakers – Hasbro, for example, sells four times as many boys’ toys as girls’ ones. Lego sold twice as many sets as expected of Lego “Friends” – a gaggle of girls dressed in pink and purple who go riding and shopping. To appease consumer groups that complain about gender stereotypes, the girls are good at map-reading and want to grow up to be engineers. Lego is building plastic bridges in Asia (sales there were up more than a quarter) and it is constantly innovating (60 per cent of its products each year are new launches).It also boasts metrics that Mattel and Hasbro can only dream about in an imaginary playland. Sales of Lego have grown by an average one quarter per annum over the past five years, compared with 1 per cent at Mattel and 3 per cent at Hasbro. Lego’s operating margins are consistently 30 per cent, double those of its larger peers. But Lego has competition. The patent on its bricks ran out some years ago and it is now up against Mega Brands’ blocks, particularly in North America. In the past six months, however, those sales came at a loss of $7m for the Canadian toy group. Lego has not hit a brick wall yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Then on Monday Salesforce announced plans to buy Buddy Media for $689m.As Zach Hofer-Shall of Forrester noted in a blog posted on Tuesday, the Oracle/Collective Intellect deal comes a year after Salesforce.com purchased Radian6 and now gives both customer relationship management groups “the components they need to piece together something powerful. With social CRM in sight, this social technology arms race is the start of something very big to come,” he said.The flurry of recent mergers and acquisitions activity reflects the growing importance of both social media and cloud-based services to the corporate customers of the leading enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP, which has also made a string of recent acquisitions.“Why the acquisition streak?” asked Mr Hofer-Shall. “Because social start-ups hold the innovation that big tech companies need. As the thousands of social start-ups can attest, building social tools can be easy, but building successful social technologies is very, very difficult.“As my colleague Melissa Parrish pointed out in her Salesforce.com/Buddy Media post: ‘These acquisitions are not about adding immediate significant revenue. They’re about adding technology offerings.’ As always, Melissa is absolutely right. None of these acquisitions pick up wildly profitable companies; they pick up unique technologies that will help the tech giants meet future market demands.”The rapid growth over the past few years of social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter has presented companies with both new marketing opportunities and challenges for keeping pace with their customers, many of whom now use social media to comment on, recommend and sometimes criticise companies and their products and services.Oracle said it planned to integrate Collective Intellect and Vitrue’s technology with its own social data management and analytics capabilities to create “the most advanced and comprehensive social relationship platform”.“Gaining intelligence from consumer conversations across social media, and knowing customers’ intentions and interests helps organisations create better products and deliver better service,” said Thomas Kurian, executive vice-president of Oracle Development, explaining the deal.Integrating Collective Intellect and Vitrue with Oracle’s existing software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products will “enable marketing organisations to create more targeted marketing campaigns; help customer service teams respond quickly to customer feedback on social media; generate targeted leads and opportunities for sales teams; and strengthen how companies build more effective brands using the internet and social media”, Oracle claimed."

Earnings per share of 12 cents were also 4 cents lower than expected.Investments banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which are less dependent on interest rate margins because less of their business is made up of deposit taking and lending, were both up on the day. Morgan Stanley rose a fraction to $15.25 and Goldman was up 0.2 per cent to $96.90.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 fell 3.3 per cent and the closely watched KBW banks index was off 3.9 per cent.The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.9 per cent to 1,200.86, on bank losses, and renewed doubts about a deal on eurozone debt, after German officials warned this weekend’s summit was unlikely to yield a comprehensive settlement.The declines marked the third time since August that the benchmark S&P 500 has rallied to 1,220 before selling off again.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.1 per cent to 11,397 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2 per cent to 2,614.92, putting both indices back in to negative territory for the year.Shares in oil and gas pipeline company El Paso Corporation soared 24.8 per cent to $24.45 after Kinder-Morgan, a rival pipeline company run by former Enron president Richard Kinder, agreed to buy El Paso for $38bn.Kinder Morgan shares rose 4.8 per cent to $28.19.Anadarko Petroleum was up 5.5 per cent to $74.44, after the company agreed a final $4bn settlement with BP over the Gulf of Mexico spill. Anadarko was a part-owner of the oil well at the centre of the environmental disaster.Oilfield services company Halliburton fell 7.8 per cent to $34.48, despite posting earnings per share of 74 cents for the three months to September 30, a 26 per cent year-on-year jump.Savings and loans holding company Charles Schwab fell 6.4 per cent to $11.95 as earnings per share of 18 cents disappointed. Although the company posted net income of $220m for the third quarter, up 77 per cent from a year ago, analysts were concerned about the impact of recent market volatility on its online brokerage subsidiary.Global media company Gannett was off 7 per cent to $10.17, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 41 cents, in line with expectations.

The board also named chairman Ray Lane as full-time executive chairman.HP’s stock has fallen by half since February and the decline accelerated last month when Mr Apotheker announced a $10.6bn purchase of UK software maker Autonomy and said HP would probably spin off its personal computer business. Shares were down to $21.63 in morning trading in New York.Each of those moves had some support from investors and board members who feel that the company should move toward software and services. HP is not expected to reverse the Autonomy bid, which would be difficult in any case under UK laws, or the spin-off decision.The core problem for some directors was Mr Apotheker’s execution and leadership. Cutting financial projections three times during his tenure alienated shareholders and he soon lost the initial goodwill he enjoyed from executives and other employees, people inside the company said.Meg Whitman, new Hewlett-Packard chief executive, said the company would stand by its decision to abandon its TouchPad tablet and other new mobile hardware, and would continue with a plan to shed the WebOS operating system on which the devices were based.“I think it was a strategic mistake to cancel the mobile products and put the operating system up for sale,” said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.“But I can’t see how they can undo that with any credibility.”HP had earlier depicted the move into mobile devices and software, through the acquisition of Palm, as an important part of efforts to extend its personal computing business beyond the mature PC industry.Mr Apotheker, the former chief executive at business software maker SAP, told the head of HP’s PC division of the planned spin-off only days before the August announcement. Other top executives learnt of critical moves, including the impending change in chief executive, through the media.The HP board is also coming under renewed fire from investors, after facing criticism last year for dismissing Mark Hurd as chief executive. Directors cleared Mr Hurd of a contractor’s sex harassment claim but lost faith in him during the inquiry.“That the board would be considering a change in CEO less that 10 months after Apotheker took over as CEO is a damning indictment of not just the new CEO, but also the board itself”, said Carter Lusher, chief analyst at Ovum. “Having approved the recent strategy changes, it seems spineless for the board just a month later to be potentially jettisoning that plan and its architect.”Although she earned fame and fortune for leading Ebay between 1998 and 2008, Ms Whitman is a far from obvious choice to run HP, Mr Lusher and other technology experts warned. Ebay caters almost entirely to consumers, while the core of HP’s customer base is big businesses.A former management consultant and Hasbro toy company executive, Ms Whitman is known for internet prowess but not broader technology expertise.Last year, Ms Whitman ran for governor of California as a Republican candidate, but lost.HP shares gained on anticipation of the chief executive change on Wednesday, then lost much of that ground on Thursday. They fell more than 5 per cent, slightly more than battered US indices.

The pay-out – equal to 45 per cent of Mattel’s net income last year – was awarded to MGA Entertainment, a small California company that took the toy industry by storm when it launched the dolls, with their pouty looks and edgy clothes, in 2001.Mattel, which makes the comparatively more demure Barbie dolls, claimed that one of its former employees had developed the Bratz idea while working at Mattel then taken it to MGA when he moved jobs. But a federal court rejected Mattel’s arguments in April and supported some of MGA’s counter-claims that Mattel had misappropriated trade secrets from its smaller rival through corporate espionage. Late on Thursday a judge raised the damages and costs due to MGA to $310m from $88m. Mattel’s net income in 2010 was $685m. The legal saga, which started in 2004, has been a distraction for Mattel’s management and investors. Mattel shares were down 0.4 per cent at $24.53 in afternoon trading. Shares in rival Hasbro, were flat at $37.29. Mattel, which saw Bratz win market share from Barbie dolls, said it was disappointed with the decision and was evaluating its next steps. It has the right to appeal. The prolonged legal battle was presented by MGA as a David versus Goliath struggle in which Mattel “resorted to litigation as a business strategy”. Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said the size of the award against Mattel meant the case could drag on for longer. “What it means is that the economics of an appeal make a whole lot more sense for Mattel. If it was under $100m they’d say: is it worth the time, money and effort to appeal this?” he said. While the company has beaten earnings expectations in the past three quarters, he said the distraction caused by the case “does keep some investors on the sidelines because the stock has some noise around it”. The case had already cost Mattel around $400m in legal fees since it began in 2004, Mr Johnson estimates. Thursday’s award consisted of a revised $85m payment from the April ruling, together with another $85m in punitive damages and $140m in legal fees and other expenses. MGA’s April victory came at a retrial that reversed a 2008 court decision that supported Mattel’s claims and awarded the company $100m. MGA always denied the allegations.

On Monday, the index traded as high as at 21.50, indicating an elevated level of market stress.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent to 12,385.16 with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also in negative territory, down 0.9 per cent at 2,765.11.This week, 106 S&P 500 companies will release earnings results, with 26 financials reporting, led by Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo due on Tuesday. Shares in BofA were down 2.8 per cent at $9.72, Goldman was down 0.6 per cent at $129.33, while Wells was down 1.1 per cent at $26.88.Analysts expect financials will see earnings decline 22.3 per cent, down from a forecast rise of 18.9 per cent a month ago, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Excluding BofA, estimated earnings for financials are actually seen rising 12.5 per cent, but that is significantly lower than expected a few months ago.Greenhill was unchanged on the day at $51.00. The US investment bank rushed to release strong second-quarter earnings ahead of schedule on Sunday. The company sought to calm investor fears after the departure of its third managing director.Discount retail broker Charles Schwab closed down 0.3 per cent at $14.97 after reporting earnings that beat estimates, as revenue generated by client advisory increased.Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth is set to rise 7.1 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, according to FactSet, including BofA’s expected loss. That sets the S&P up for its first single-digit earnings gain after six quarters of double-digit results.“We have seen a modest downward revision to the 2011 S&P 500 consensus earnings per share estimate, due in part to Bank of America’s lowered guidance and lower oil prices,” said Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.“The 2012 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate has fallen a slight 0.5 per cent from its mid-June peak, but remains lofty in our view at $113. We continue to believe that first half 2011 estimates are achievable, but the second half is a concern,” added Mr Parker.Traders were also watching ongoing negotiations in Washington over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling before a deadline of August 2. Last week, S&P and Moody’s each warned that a failed debt payment by the US Treasury would result in a downgrade of the triple A rating of the US.“Until we get some announcement that there is a debt deal here in the US, the market will also be dominated by European debt worries and the low volume that is causing more of a volatile situation. Shortly the market will begin to divorce itself from these issues as earnings season has been good,” said Peter Cardillo, chief economist with Avalon Partners.The S&P energy sector was down on Monday even as earnings mostly beat expectations, closing down 0.4 per cent.Halliburton, the oilfield services provider, closed up 0.1 per cent at $53.12 despite the company releasing earning results that beat estimates before the opening bell. Its second-quarter profit increased as higher crude prices led to more spending on exploration and production, with net income rising to $739m or 80 cents a share.Out of 44 companies reporting second-quarter earnings by Monday morning, 31 had beaten expectations, with earnings on average outpacing forecasts by 8.9 per cent, according to S&P Valuation and Risk Strategies Research.IBM closed down 0.2 per cent at $175.28. The company beat estimates, releasing positive second-quarter earning results after the closing bell.On the media sector, News Corp skidded 4.3 per cent at $14.96 at closing. The company is still in the spotlight as the UK phone-hacking scandal continues to unravel and the group faces possible legal challenges in the US. On Monday, shares in News Corp kept plummeting. Mr Murdoch and his son James are due to appear before a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday.With Delta Air Lines at the helm, down 4.1 per cent at $8.06, shares of major US airlines tumbled to one-year lows on Monday amid expectations that travel will slow down in the autumn.Elsewhere, LinkedIn dropped 6.9 per cent to $102.44 as JPMorgan Chase, one of the underwriters of the company’s initial public offering, downgraded its rating from “overweight” to “neutral”. The social network focused on job seekers began trading in May and its shares have risen 47 per cent since June 24.
84;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2011-05-16T20:40:06Z;Those in charge decide which words matter;Companies that care about writing can pick job-seekers who care too;Is “aarrghh” a word? Not if you are playing Scrabble with me. If it is not in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary: put your tiles back and think again. “Aargh” is acceptable (an expression of anguish, horror, rage, or other strong emotion, according to the OED), but not “aarrghh”. My board, my rules.Others disagree. “Aarrghh” appears in the Collins Official Scrabble Words. Collins’ latest edition also includes “thang”, “innit” and “nang”. Commentators greeted the Scrabble book by bemoaning the decline of the language and berating publishers who pandered to the young.The new Collins book appeared on the same day that the CBI, the UK employers’ organisation, published a survey showing that 42 per cent of companies were dissatisfied with school leavers’ English skills. Are the two events connected?Well, “innit” has passed into the language. It is in my Concise Oxford (Brit. informal, isn’t it). “Thang” and “nang” are not. I googled them (yes, google v. is in the OED), but I can’t vouch for the results. Even Official Scrabble Words doesn’t tell us what “thang” and “nang” mean. This is the odd thing about the Collins book: it has no definitions, just word lists.I asked Elaine Higgleton, publishing director at Collins English Dictionaries, about this, but first I had a few things to get off my chest. Didn’t every family set its own Scrabble rules – no abbreviations, no slang, or whatever? Who is Scrabble, let alone Collins, to interfere? Once we have paid for our set, surely it is our business what we do with it?Ms Higgleton said she accepted many families used their own dictionaries, but if a publisher wanted to put Scrabble in its title, it needed a licence from Mattel, the US toy group that owned the rights to the game outside North America. Hasbro, another US toy group, which owns Scrabble in North America, has given its licence to Merriam-Webster, which publishes the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary. (I know, no apostrophe. See decline of language, above.)I told Ms Higgleton I accepted that language changed. But shouldn’t dictionaries be conservative, ensuring neologisms were well established before including them? Take another addition to the Collins book: “splog”. What was it? A combination of spam and blog – a blog transmitted virally over the internet. Ms Higgleton said it was useful if one of the other players had put down “log”. Was “splog” in the main Collins English dictionary? She conceded that it wasn’t.Finally, why were there no definitions in the Collins book? A Scrabble dictionary with definitions would appear later this year and one for families, with rude words taken out, in 2012, she said. But Official Scrabble Words was written in consultation with competitive players and they just wanted a list of what was allowed and what wasn’t.For most of us, the joy of coming up with an obscure word is that, when challenged, we can open the dictionary and announce what it means. Scrabble tournament players mostly don’t care what a word means. As Stefan Fatsis wrote in his entertaining book Word Freak, competitive Scrabble “isn’t the most highly functional sub-culture around”. The top players are not tidy dressers who devote their irregular hours to memorising seven-letter words and yelling anagram challenges at each other. Some players enjoy more intricate wordplay – my favourite wore a T-shirt with the slogan “Does anal retentive have a hyphen?” – but most do not revel in what Mr Fatsis calls “the beauty, wonder or irony of language”. But that is their world and this is their list. The true competitors are unlikely to play the Scrabble dabblers and they would crush us if they did.In the same way, people whose everyday speech is spattered with “thangs”, “nangs” and “innits” are fine when they are talking to each other. The problem comes when they apply for jobs and crash into the appalled members of the CBI.Complaints about illiteracy are probably as old as writing. I imagine that Sumerian pensioners moaned that kids those days had no idea how to hold a stylus. But something deeper is happening now. Writing is changing. Young people probably do more of it than their predecessors ever did, but their texts and Facebook messages abbreviate, ignore apostrophes and dispense with upper case.Perhaps, a generation from now, that will be the style in which companies communicate with their customers, judges hand down their judgments and teachers write school reports. (Yes, I can hear some of you saying that it is already happening.)In the meantime, with youth unemployment high, companies that care about writing can pick job-seekers who care too, and put pressure on schools that don’t. Employers are in a position to say: our board, our rules. It is not an opportunity that will last forever.michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/skapinker
85;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
86;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2011-04-14T20:52:27Z;Weekly jobless data weigh on Wall Street;;Goldman Sachsled financial stocks lower after a Senate report said that the bank had misled investors, while in the wider markets Wall Street was flat after the disappointment caused by weak jobs data were offset by some positive first-quarter earnings reports.The investment banking group was down 2.7 per cent to $155.79 after Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, said a two-year probe found that banks, including Goldman, mis-sold mortgage-backed securities and misled investors and lawmakers.“We will be referring this matter to the justice department and to the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission],” said Mr Levin. “In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and they misled Congress.”Last year, Goldman paid $550m to settle SEC allegations that it defrauded investors in Abacus, a complex security linked to subprime mortgages.The S&P financial index was down 0.9 per cent, the worst-performing S&P sub-index, not helped by news that analysts at Goldman had downgraded the financial sector to “neutral” from “overweight”. SunTrust Banks lost 2.8 per cent to $28.19 while JPMorgan Chase fell 2.8 per cent to $44.97.The financial sector also continued to be weighed on by news from the previous session that US banking regulators had ordered 14 large mortgage servicers to overhaul their foreclosure practices and set up a process to recompense borrowers who improperly lost their homes.In the wider markets the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,314.52, with sentiment weighed on by data from the Labor Department showing that initial jobless claims in the US had unexpectedly jumped by 27,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 412,000. This was ahead of the 3,000 increase that had been expected by economists.The previous week’s jobless figures were also revised up, causing further uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in the US labour market.Helping to encourage the markets, however, and limit any losses were some promising first-quarter earnings reports. Supervalu, the third-largest US supermarket chain by sales, was up 16.9 per cent to $10.61 after reporting better-than-expected profits and giving a yearly earnings forecast that topped analysts’ estimates. This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1 per cent at 12,285.15 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,760.22.The S&P index is down 1 per cent so far this week. “We are getting to the point where the market is a little fatigued, and a lot of the good news about the generally improving economy and the earnings season is already priced in,” said Channing Smith, managing director of Capital Advisors.The S&P index is still up 4.5 per cent this year and 25.3 per cent since late August when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, started hinting that the central bank would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying programme. “We have had some powerful tailwinds recently thanks both to the Fed and to companies successfully streamlining their businesses and improving margins” said Mr Smith. “But now rising commodity prices are hurting margins and the era of easy money is drawing to a close, these two headwinds are starting to reverse.”Wall Street saw a strong first days trading for two companies who made an initial public offering in the previous session.Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, priced at $17 a share, above its projected range of $13 to $15, after the closing bell on Wednesday, making it the most successful Latin American flotation since the financial crisis. In its first day of trading, the company was up 24.7 per cent to $21.20.ZipCar, the web-based hourly car rental group, saw an even more successful first day of trading after its IPO late on Wednesday. The company priced at $18, also above the projected range and began trading up 55.6 per cent at $28.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Hasbro, the toymaker, reported first-quarter earnings down 71 per cent from the same period last year, sending the shares 3 per cent lower to $44.40.Google was up 0.4 per cent to $578.51 in anticipation of its first-quarter results, which were due to be released after the closing bell. Analysts were expecting earnings of $8.11 per share for the quarter.

It is on course to raise $500m to finance acquisitions in media, sports and entertainment, with investors including Terry Semel, former chief executive of Yahoo, Jay and Miky Lee, from the family that started Samsung, and Masayoshi Son, founder of Softbank, the Japanese media group.WPP, the marketing group, and Mubadala Development, the Abu Dhabi-owned investment vehicle, are backers, according to people close to the situation.The boutique bank is close to completing its third investment, having agreed to acquire a stake in OpenSky, an online social shopping service. It has bought a stake in Vice, the style magazine, and invested in Jagex, a Cambridge-based online games developer and publisher.Raine declined to comment, as did WME. But the two companies are close partners: Mr Emanuel, brother of Rahm Emanuel, the new mayor of Chicago, and Patrick Whitesell, a fellow partner at WME, sit on Raine’s advisory board.WME, which represents stars such as Martin Scorsese and Christian Bale, is working with Raine on how best to exploit deals. One option being explored with Jagex is to turn RuneScape, the company’s popular multiplayer online game, into a movie developed by Hasbro Studios, the film development arm of Hasbro, the toy company.Hasbro, which developed the blockbuster Transformers series of films, is a WME client.Raine is scouring Asia for possible acquisitions, according to another person familiar with the situation. “They’re focused on high-growth areas in growth regions,” the person added.Some WME clients are also backing Raine, including Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who control the lucrative sport of Ultimate Fighting Championship.Other Raine investors include Richard Rosenblatt, the founder of Demand Media, who sold MySpace to News Corp, and Marc Andreessen, the Facebook board member and co-founder of Netscape Communications.Ray Chambers, the former private equity investor, and Ted Forstmann, the owner of IMG, the sports marketing group, are also involved and sit on Raine’s advisory board.

He was part of the team that bought Hit and sits on its board of directors.His expected departure comes as Stephen Grabiner, former head of Apax’s media team and the boss of its London office, also steps down. Both men have decided not to be part of its next fundraising, due to start next year.Apax recently held a “beauty parade” of investment banks to choose an adviser for a strategic review of Hit, which it bought for £489m in 2005. It is poised to pick either UBS or Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Hit could be worth as much as $1.5bn (£940m), according to bankers.Thomas the Tank Engine has become the top-selling pre-school toy for boys in China and is by far the leading performer in Hit’s stable, which also includes Angelina Ballerina, Fireman Sam and Pingu.Hit has plans for a Thomas the Tank Engine film, which would make it an attractive purchase for a big media group such as Disney.This year Apax struck a deal with Hit’s lenders to extend its loan facilities until 2012 in return for paying higher interest on its £356m of remaining debt. The company was forced to ask for more headroom in its covenants.However, Hit’s performance has rebounded recently, helped by soaring sales of Thomas the Tank Engine merchandise, which have risen 50 per cent in the US during the past year after Hit teamed up with Fisher-Price, the toymaker.Apax is also in the early stages of considering a sale next year of Trader Media, owner of the second-hand car magazine Auto Trader, which it jointly controls with Guardian Media Group, the newspaper publisher.The private equity group also completed its first new media deal for several years by paying $163m for a 19 per cent stake in SouFun, the Chinese property website, which completed an initial public offering in New York last month.
89;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2010-10-26T20:52:22Z;An office looks good by looking simple;Too many workplaces smack of self-indulgence;"Is a workforce more productive in a wonderful building, or are the surroundings almost an irrelevance? When I visit someone in a splendid new office, two thoughts strike me: first, how pleasant it must be to occupy such comfortable accommodation; and second, how very expensive.As a business owner, spending your own cash on the rent and fit-out of an HQ, you should be acutely aware of the relative expense of good-looking space. It is the classic fixed overhead – and usually a long-term rigid commitment. In an era of relentless competition, stagnant revenues, rising costs and squeezed margins, lavishing large sums on palatial surroundings feels like a bad idea.As a case in point, in 2007 the highest office rent ever in London – and possibly the world – was paid by an Icelandic business for an office floor in Mayfair. That company is now bankrupt and being investigated by the police for suspected financial crimes.Yet there is a cohort of reputable brands that do feel the need to have super funky workplaces – and obviously feel they can afford them. A recent book, I Wish I Worked There!, describes the extraordinary offices of companies such as Google, Hasbro, Nike, Sony Music, Virgin and Urban Outfitters. Apparently, their environments “stimulate, enable reflection, promote collaboration and encourage play”. I accept that decent working conditions help in recruiting and retaining talent. But do on-site massage and basketball courts have such a positive influence over the efficiency and creativity of an enterprise, or are they just self-indulgent? It would be fun to labour on a campus like that – but I’m not sure I would get much work done.More typical are glittering tower blocks. They may look imposing, but I think they lack character and tend to crush the individuality of those slaving away in them. As Noel Coward said: “The higher the buildings, the lower the morals”. The managers of such facilities appear to be obsessed with security – entering some is as exasperating as travelling through an airport. And negotiating repeated layers of receptions, then waiting endlessly for elevators is tedium itself. The entire impression is of a bland, impersonal edifice, the epitome of a corporate anthill.It is curious how service organisations such as investment banks, accountants, lawyers and advertising agencies tend to lease ostentatious premises with profligate foyers, magnificent views and extravagant meeting rooms. Visiting clients must surely think: “My fees are paying for all this grandeur – am I getting good value from my supplier?”Basics such as location, size, heating, lighting and price are ultimately more important than appearance. The cleverest entrepreneurs with whom I’ve partnered have always taken space below their company’s means, because status symbols matter less to them than operating a lean business.Start-ups often find the best bet is shared space, incubators or serviced offices. They may not be plush, but they are flexible, and when you are focused on survival, you watch every penny and each long-term obligation. Moreover, in the digital age, many staff can work from home or on the move, with hot-desking a common feature of many outfits. Such circumstances are unlikely to be relaxing, but they are economical.I like well-designed commercial structures , and I appreciate high-quality offices. But too often such workplaces are an architect’s folly, built by developers to appeal to the vanity of conceited business leaders and planning officers. I do not think offices should be ugly or shoddy. But at heart such buildings are 21st-century workshops, which must be functional and ergonomic in all aspects.The head offices of my most successful investments included a metal shed on an industrial estate, a converted textile mill and a mezzanine floor in a warehouse. Hardly prestigious, but they did the job – and meant more cash could be ploughed into winning customers, launching products, hiring the best people and owning the finest machines. It’s all a question of priorities.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts"

And, one of the best ways of doing this, is to participate in intra-LBS and inter-business school competitions. Not only is it a great learning opportunity to test drive different careers, but also (if you make it that far) an opportunity for some healthy inter-business school rivalry. Since arriving at LBS I have participated in two competitions – the LBS private equity competition and the Chicago Booth IPO Challenge.In the private equity competition, several teams of four, put together an analysis on a potential leveraged buy-out of the US toy manufacturer Hasbro. There has been a lot of media talk recently of a potential “go-private” transaction for the company, and it was our job to determine whether or not the deal should be consummated.My team included one management consultant turned private equity investor, one investment banker turned private equity investor, one management consultant and yours truly. In the final round of the private equity competition we presented to a real managing director from a London-based private equity fund and the head of the private equity institute at LBS, Prof Eli Talmor.While unfortunately, we didn’t win, the experience of getting “grilled” by actual practioners in private equity was a fantastic learning opportunity.Last weekend, I participated in the Chicago Booth IPO Challenge. The objective of the competition is to put together the best presentation (what in investment banker parlance is called a “pitch”) to win a deal to lead an initial public offering. The only catch is that in true investment banking fashion, there is a time crunch. We were given the case at 3pm on Saturday and were given exactly 24 hours to build our valuation analysis and complete an entire IPO pitch.It was a very real simulation of what it is like to be an investment banking associate. As one of the only former investment bankers on the team, I had to make sure that the numbers were correct and that we were positioning the company in the best possible light. My work was made easy since my team was incredibly talented and included another investment banker, a former equity research analyst, a management consultant and an engineering programme manager.It was quite fun working into the wee hours of the morning and reminded me of all the good times in the “bullpen” with my fellow investment banking analysts. This year, over 150 teams competed from around the world, from schools such as Wharton and Columbia but only 18 were selected for the final round in Chicago.We are not one of the chosen 18 teams, but have been selected as an alternate in case one of the other teams cannot attend. Last year, LBS sent three teams to the Chicago Booth IPO Challenge, who were placed first, second and third out of all 15 teams that made it to the second round. We have some big shoes to fill this year!

The bank, which is 12 per cent owned by the US government, reported losses in 2008 and 2009.Shares in Citigroup surged 5.6 per cent to $4.17 and the S&P 500 financial index bounced back, climbing 2.3 per cent after falling 2.4 per cent last week.But analysts at Credit Sights said that adjusting for the money the bank released from its reserves, and a loss from the sale of the Student Loan Company, earnings were actually below its expectations.Andrew Neale, portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners, said that the US government’s stake in the bank would weigh on the stock for some time. “Citigroup is still probably in the weakest position of the big banks,” he said.He shrugged off fears about the potential cost of the foreclosure crisis, which dragged the financial sector down last week. “This foreclosure issue is going to get sorted out. It may dent earnings next quarter and then they’ll bounce back the quarter after that,” he said. “It’s not a net loss for
the banks, just a shift in earnings from quarter to quarter.”Investors were shaken by the potential exposure of major banks to foreclosure losses after it was revealed that they may have improperly processed thousands of mortgage documents. Citigroup said it had not uncovered any irregularities in its foreclosure process.Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $12.34 after it said it planned to resume foreclosures, which it halted this month, in 23 states. Bank of America is one of three leading banks due to post earnings this week. The other two also rose, with Wells Fargo adding 5.5 per cent to $24.87 and Goldman Sachs gaining 2 per cent to $153.70.Financial stocks helped push the broader market into positive territory. The S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,184.71, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent at 11,143.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,480.66.In the technology sector, the market was looking ahead to earnings reports from Apple and IBM, which both recently hit all-time highs, due for release after the close.The S&P 500 technology index rose 0.5 per cent, Apple rose 1 per cent to $318.00 and IBM gained 1.3 per cent to $142.83. IBM beat expectations on its revenue and earnings. But the computer services provider posted its third successive quarterly drop in new contracts. Shares fell by 2.7 per cent to $139.04 in after hours trading.In other earnings news, Halliburton slid 4.8 per cent to $34.09 even though the oilfield services company posted a jump in quarterly profit. Its shares have soared 30 per cent since it reported its last quarterly results in July. In the US, a surge in onshore drilling offset the drop in offshore activity after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but profit fell in all regions outside North America.Toymaker Hasbro rose 3.8 per cent to $46.81 after it reported a better than expected third-quarter profit. Rival Mattel missed analysts’ sales forecasts last week, but sales at Hasbro rose 3 per cent in the quarter, boosted by strong demand for preschool and boys’ toys.Shares in Mattel were higher by 0.5 per cent to $22.55. Hasbro said it expected the strong sales to continue into the holiday season and is increasing inventories.But JC Penney weighed on the consumer discretionary index, which was the only main sector to fall. It fell 0.2 per cent, as shares in the retailer dropped 1.7 per cent to $33.30.The retailer’s board approved plans for a “poison pill” which aims to deter potential takeover threats, after Pershing Square, the activist hedge fund, and Vornado, the real estate investment company, bought more than 25 per cent of the company.In industrials, Fluor, the construction and engineering company, suffered after a delay in the delivery of a wind farm in the UK forced it to reduce its full-year profit forecast.

Toymakers, however, are subject to less sentimental analysis. So with Hasbro on Thursday admitting that it refuses to play with a private equity outfit that wants to get its hands on Transformers and Tonka toys, what should the world’s second-largest manufacturer of dolls and games by revenues be worth?Pestering by kids historically produces steady but unexciting annual sales growth in the low single digits. But market shifts have helped large, established toymakers, and given Hasbro an edge over its bigger peer Mattel. Concentration of retail power in the hands of chains such as Walmart and Toys-R-Us means demand for guaranteed sellers – well-established brands, and anything tied to entertainment.At the same time, the market for established intellectual property has expanded to television, films and computer games, particularly as Hollywood raids toy boxes for ideas. In the past decade, Hasbro shares ranged from a low of seven times prospective earnings up to a high of 33 times, calculates UBS. Enthusiasm for film tie-ins – the two Transformers films have grossed more than $1bn worldwide – leaves Hasbro on 16 times, a point or two above both the broader market and its five-year average.Disney’s purchase of Marvel last year for an exorbitant 13 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (to Hasbro’s current nine times) might be a top-marker. But Marvel has thousands of characters to mine – and superheroes transfer more readily to the big screen than Monopoly; and in any case, the mouse factory overpaid. There is also a danger of franchise fatigue and diminishing returns as the stock of intellectual property is exhausted and more investment is required. Hasbro also has a cable network joint venture launching this year that relies on aggressive audience targets. This toy is not worth fighting for.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"

The deal will add at least 50 cents per share to Ralcorp’s full-year earnings, the company said.Synaptics, a leading provider of touchpad technology, rallied 4.4 per cent to $29.27 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” at Collins Stewart, with a target share price of $36.The broker cited a meaningful recovery in touchscreen smartphone market share as the trigger for the move.US-listed shares in BASF, the world’s largest chemicals maker, added 0.2 per cent to $57.15 on reports that it is close to announcing a deal to purchase Cognis, a maker of chemicals used in cosmetics, for about $3.9bn.
94;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2010-06-15T22:03:30Z;A big player in the toy market;Enrico Preziosi adapts his strategy to changing times;Enrico Preziosi recently confessed to a grievous error of judgment. In his previous role, a decade ago, as chairman of Lombardy-based Como football club, the Italian received a fax from an Argentine friend. It said: “I have this phenomenal player under contract. It is $50,000 for him.”Mr Preziosi immediately dispatched some scouts to watch the teenage Argentinian in action. They returned with the verdict that Lionel Messi – now widely regarded as the best footballer of the current generation – was not good enough. So Messi signed for Barcelona. “History could have been different,” the perma-tanned 62-year-old muses, before bursting into laughter.Luckily for him, he appears to display more discernment in his day job at the helm of Giochi Preziosi, the world’s fifth-largest toymaker, which he founded in 1977. Revenues, driven by sales of small monster-like figures called Gormiti and Cicciobello dolls (see box), are expected to come close to €1bn ($1.2bn, £800m) this year with profits of more than €100m. A stock market flotation, which analysts value at €1bn, possibly later this year, is on the cards.What marks GP out from its larger rivals Mattel, Hasbro and Lego is that it is vertically integrated. One of Mr Preziosi’s main successes has been to see the importance of not only distributing and designing its own toys, but owning its production facilities as well as shops. This has meant the company is involved in every stage of the process.And GP is no longer just about toys. Ten years ago, the company began to branch out into chocolate eggs and crisps as well as Christmas decorations, back-to-school products, shoes and prams.“I follow the target, not just the toys,” Mr Preziosi says of this burgeoning product offering.The group’s primary market is Italy, where it is the biggest toy company by sales with a quarter of the market and makes more than a third of its revenues. In recent years, however, it has increased its market share in Spain, France and the UK.This growth owes much to Mr Preziosi’s constant modification of his strategy in reaction to the shifting tastes of successive generations of children. “About every five years, toys change completely,” he says. “If you want to stay stable in the market you have to be trendy. In 1978, girls still played with dolls aged 14. Now if I gave my daughter, aged 11, a doll she would throw it out of the window.”Mr Preziosi was born in southern Italy in 1948. He moved to Milan as a teenager with just pocket money on him. After a succession of low-paying jobs such as unloading lorries, he set up GP in 1977 in his garage. Initially he sold toys worth 1,000 lira (then about $1) to street hawkers. Money was so tight that he could only afford to buy about 500 toys at a time.But in 1981 he had to change his strategy as his growing number customers increasingly demanded higher quality toys than the ones he was selling. He decided to offer a diverse selection of better-quality products to a few bigger customers so he went to Hong Kong and began sourcing and importing toys himself.His big break came in 1985. Having jealously eyed the high sales of his competitors, Hasbro and Mattel, who advertised on television, he decided to follow suit. So he went to see Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s current prime minister who was then a successful television entrepreneur. “I asked him: ‘How much do Mattel and Hasbro spend and when?’ He said: ‘Just in October and November.’ ‘OK,’ I said. ‘I want to buy all the year starting in January. I want to be on TV every day.’”He paid 3bn lira (at the time about $1.5m), one-seventh of his annual revenues, for the privilege. The television campaign gave his sales an immediate fillip. By 1987 they had risen five-fold to 101bn lira (then about $75m) and the next year they doubled again as GP started to sell products related to television programmes such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.At the same time, Mr Preziosi moved into retail, setting up a series of franchised shops called Giocheria. In 1994, he added bigger stores, called Toys Center, to his offering. At about the same time, the company started making its own products in Hong Kong, completing its vertical integration. It now employs 8,000 people in the region and a further 110 in its research and development centre in Shenzhen. “You can control the costs everywhere,” he explains. “If you buy from the producer you have to accept the price and your mark-up is linked to that. But we can buy the raw materials and we can organise the production. We even produce for Disney and Bandai under licence.”The past decade has brought a diversification away from toys and an internationalisation of the company. In 2000, Mr Preziosi noticed he was losing custom from children aged 10 to 14 so he went into the back-to-school area to compensate with products such as rucksacks and stationery.Food and shoes soon followed as did the establishment of companies in Spain, France, Greece and Germany and the acquisition of Flair, a UK distributor.Last year GP bought a 50 per cent stake in Kaleeto International, a Chinese toy retailer, which Mr Preziosi describes as “a bet for the future”.In Italy, he is like many businessmen, best known for his role in football, where he is chairman of Genoa, who play in the top division, Serie A. But it has little to do with his day job, which he approaches with less frivolity than many of GP’s managers. Unlike them, his room is free of toys – instead he has the Italian share prices on his TV screen, so that he can keep a close eye on markets.As well as the possible IPO, Mr Preziosi has set an ambitious target of doubling GP’s revenues within the next five years, partly through acquisitions. This could include the US, where GP currently has no presence.The company is also making a big push into international retail, opening 200 shops in countries including Spain, Switzerland and France.With the help of two managing directors, he has wound down his day-to-day involvement in the running of the company – which is now in the hands of two managing directors. Yet GP remains very much Mr Preziosi’s company. In what could be a metaphor for the control he exerts over the company, at the end of our interview, he discusses the recent annual company football match. While no Lionel Messi, his team produced a stunning win. “I scored six goals, four of which were penalties,” he laughs. “The referee was an employee.”As one of his senior manager adds afterwards: “Nobody wanted to tackle him – as he came near us it was like the parting of the Red Sea.”

Its shares jumped 12.7 per cent to $34.71.Home Depot added 2.2 per cent to $28.59 after Morgan Stanley raised the home improvement chain to “overweight” from “equal-weight”.Analyst Gregory Melich noted improving trends in the housing market and said there was more room for margin growth than the market was currently pricing in.Meanwhile, Lowe’s, the country’s second-largest home improvement retailer, announced the opening of its first store in Mexico as part of its international expansion strategy.Shares in the group, which underperformed Home Depot by more than 10 percentage points last year, rose 0.8 per cent to $21.76.Amazon.com initially rose after analysts at Collins Stewart upgraded the internet retailer to “buy” from “hold”, noting the growth potential of the company’s electronic book business. The shares were later down 0.5 per cent at $116.83.Walt Disney also briefly benefited from an upgrade but later slipped 0.2 per cent to $29.48. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase raised the world’s largest media group to “neutral” from “underweight”.While improving economic conditions would boost revenues, Walt Disney is likely to lag behind the rest of the sector. due to challenging trends at the film studio and parks, they said.Weyerhaeuser, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper companies, was raised to “neutral” from “underperform” at Credit Suisse.The brokerage also raised its price target on the stock to $42 from $40 on the prospect of higher demand for wood in the economic recovery.

96;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2010-01-29T15:01:28Z;Mattel;;Barbie is back. Mattel on Friday reported sales growth for its 50-year-old pink princesses for the first time in almost two years. It helps that the latest fashionista Barbies strut over the cold dead earth where Bratz is buried – in late 2008 Mattel won a court dispute over the rights to Barbie’s edgier multi-ethnic rival that saw Bratz pulled from shelves. But with small boys also snapping up Hot Wheels, the largest US toymaker reported fourth-quarter profits almost double that of a year ago.Such performance should help keep Mattel ahead of its smaller rival Hasbro, which until last year had been the better share price performer for most of the past decade. Hasbro has fewer movie themed tie-ins to call on this year, and its boy division, contributing about a third of sales, may struggle to match the strong performance of recent years. Mattel’s blue-skinned Na’avi could also start to push Hasbro’s Transformers out of the toy box as Avatar’s popularity widens.Still, selling toys remains a highly competitive market where big retailers such as Walmart use pricing to attract parents into stores. Toys proved relatively resilient in the recession, as happy faces on Christmas day are hard to forgo, but the industry is also mature and slow growing – Mattel’s sales growth has averaged less than 2 per cent for the past decade.The company’s aspiration to move operating margins into the 15 to 20 per cent range in the long term are also likely to remain just that. In 20 years profitability has flirted with such levels, but has mostly been around the 13 per cent rate. Mattel is cheap on 12 times prospective earnings, but for investors the sector offers less excitement than a spirited nerf gun battle.
97;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-12-20T16:45:48Z;The job;;Duncan Billing: toy designer at HasbroAs head of design and development at Hasbro, the toy company, Christmas is a pretty important time of year for me, at least in terms of sales. Many years ago, this was the quietest time of year, when the design had been done and we just had to wait and see if the games sold. But now we are as busy as ever, marketing the 2010 line and planning for 2011 and 2012.This year, Transformers toys have done particularly well after the success of the sequel. Entertainment is increasingly important to us – we recently established Hasbro Studios to produce TV programmes along with Discovery Communications.The classic games tend to sell the best. There is nothing that can really replace the social experience of a board game. Monopoly continues to be a good seller – the magic about that game is that every country thinks it was invented there. It was, in fact, invented in the US.The design of a toy or game is what everything revolves around – you have to have a great idea. But you also have to be able to execute it, and working out what is actually producable is an important part of my job.I have two boys, aged 18 and 19, and we love playing board games. This Christmas we will probably sit down to play Yahtzee. It has all the right ingredients: it is simple, fun and very addictive.

It’s staying focused and staying on-brand with all the programming while finding the next big hit.”He would work closely with Mr Hollinger, he said, to integrate domestic and international programming more closely and efficiently.
99;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-10-19T22:30:48Z;Toys R Us launches a ‘layaway’ service;;Toys R Us, the largest US speciality toy seller, has stepped up the battle for budget conscious holiday shoppers by launching a new “layaway” payment – or pay by instalments – service for gifts such as children’s bikes, dolls houses and musical instruments.The retailer, which operates more than 848 stores in the US, said the service provided customers with “another option for budgeting their holiday spending and allowing them to make smaller payments over time”. Layaway allows customers to have an item set aside for them, which they pay for in regular instalments, and was a feature of retailing in the 1940s and 1950s. However, its popularity faded as credit cards and credit accounts became widely available. Walmart, the low-cost discounter, closed its layaway programme in 2006.But the recession, and growing pressure on customers’ credit card spending limits, has seen the return of the concept at some retailers, including Sears, which reintroduced layaway across its department stores last year. Kmart, the discounter, cited its layaway programme as a factor supporting its holiday sales last year.Toys R Us, which is making a $10 charge for the service, is also offering the service at its Babies R Us stores for items such as car seats and pushchairs.The big three US toy retailers – Toys R Us, Walmart and Target – are in the middle of a bitter battle for customers.Walmart announced at the end of September that it would cut prices on 100 popular toys to $10, while Target has retaliated with price cuts of up to 50 per cent on toys including Barbie dolls and GI Joe action figures.As it battles for sales, Toys R Us has also started opening 80 smaller temporary stores, called “Toys R Us Holiday Express”, to supplement its large “big box” stores. Most of the new small stores are in shopping mall sites previously occupied by KB Toys, which went bankrupt last year. It is also expanding the area devoted to toys at its more than 260 Babies R Us locations.Hasbro, the second-largest US toy company by sales after Mattel, said on Monday it expected “a challenging global retail environment” for the rest of the year but that it was encouraged by initial fourth quarter demand.Brian Goldner, chief executive, said: “We believe we can grow revenues in 2009 if our consumer retail takeaway continues to improve in line with recent …trends.”The company has lowered some prices and eliminated some of its most expensive toys for the coming season.Hasbro’s shares fell more than 4 per cent in New York, after it reported a 1.7 per cent decline in third quarter revenues to $1.28bn. Net earnings rose over 8 per cent to $150.4m against a year ago.

The last time it traded above 1,100 was in October 2008.“There have been a few misses in terms of revenues, but what the market is focusing on is the fact that most companies have beaten market expectations,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York.Traders are looking for positive news on corporate earnings as a sign that the nascent economic recovery is taking hold. Stocks had priced in fairly rosy expectations, analysts said.The big news of the day was to come in after-hours trade when technology bellwethers Apple and Texas Instruments released their results. Apple shares were 1 per cent higher at $189.86 and Texas Instruments was up 3.4 per cent higher at $23.52 ahead of their earnings reports.Shares of Caterpillar surged 6 per cent to $57.85 ahead of the release of the earnings today for the maker of construction, farming and mining equipment.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday raised its 12-month target on Caterpillar from $52 to $65.RBC Capital Markets on Friday initiated coverage of Caterpillar with a rating of “outperform” and a price target of $65.“We view [Caterpillar] as among the best-positioned companies to benefit from improving global growth and the attendant spending on construction, infrastructure, commodities, and the like,” RBC said.Caterpillar’s rise helped to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent higher to 10,092.19, holding above the psychological level of 10,000 it breached last week for the first time in a year.After an early decline, the Nasdaq recovered and ended up 0.9 per cent at 2,176.32.This week is one of the peak weeks for the third quarter 2009 earnings season, with 13 Dow components and more than 130 S&P 500 companies expected to announce results.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter will fall 22.6 per cent, down from a previous estimate of 24.6 per cent last week at the beginning of earnings season. This is due in part to better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the financial sector.Nonetheless, companies that released earnings on Monday showed some mixed results, initially prompting fluctuation in the large indices.Gannett, publisher of USA Today, reported a 53 per cent decline in third quarter net profit, but exceeded its own expectations on improved advertising spending trends and steep cost cuts. Its shares rose 8.2 per cent at $14.06.Advertising revenues at its publishing division fell 28.4 per cent to $699.6m from last year, which was less severe than the year-on-year declines in the first and second quarters of this year when advertising fell more than 30 per cent.Eaton gained 5.7 per cent to $63.89 after the diversified manufacturing company reported better-than- expected quarterly earnings and boosted its full-year estimate.Hasbro was down 3.7 per cent at $28.42 after the toy maker said its quarterly profit rose 8.8 per cent, which was ahead of the expectations on Wall Street, however, its revenues declined.After the results, Standards and Poor’s upgraded Hasbro to “buy” from “hold”, saying that although revenues of $1.28bn were below their $1.37bn estimate, higher than expected cost reductions meant earnings per share of 99 cents, against 89 cents a year earlier, were in line with their estimate. S&P noted that revenues grew 1 per cent excluding foreign exchange and that improved margins would likely aid results into 2010.BB&T‘s quarterly profit fell more than 50 per cent as the financial company continued to sort through credit issues from the financial crisis.

A film based on its 45-year-old GI Joe action figure will be released by Viacom’s Paramount this year, along with a sequel to the 2007 Transformers movie.A video games tie-up with Electronic Arts had given its brands “new lives”, creating some of the most popular online and mobile games and helping boost Mono-poly’s board game sales by 40 per cent in recent years, said Brian Goldner, Hasbro chief executive.The new channel is due to launch in the US late next year, taking over from Discovery Kids, which is in 60m US homes. Discovery will look to distribute shows around the world in time.Hasbro said it had arranged to borrow up to $200m to finance the investment.The investment comes as cable television channels are showing resilient growth.A souring economy has meant “people are spending more time at home”, Mr Zaslav said, adding that Discovery had seen almost double-digit growth in the first quarter.
102;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-04-28T00:52:18Z;Hollywood talent agencies merge;;Hollywood talent agencies William Morris and Endeavor agreed to merge on Monday in a deal that better positions them to compete against Creative Artists Agency, the industry leader.The deal brings together William Morris, which, at 111 years old is the most venerable talent agency in Hollywood, with Endeavor, founded by Ari Emanuel, the brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.The merger between the second and third largest agencies, has been the talk of the town in Hollywood for months and comes as talent agencies try to adjust to a rapidly changing business. Under pressure from sharply declining DVD sales – the film industry’s biggest revenue stream – Hollywood studios are desperate to drive down talent pay.This has left the agencies, which typically earn a 10 per cent commission for every deal they put together, looking for savings and new business opportunities.Endeavor has fared better than most. As one of the newest agencies in Hollywood, it has enjoyed great success thanks to the flair and energy of its founder, who inspired the foul-mouthed Ari Gold character in the HBO series Entourage.With a roster of clients that includes Martin Scorsese, Robert de Niro and Matt Damon – as well as Danny Boyle, who won the best director Oscar at this year’s Academy Awards – Endeavor has attracted some of the biggest stars in the industry.William Morris, meanwhile, has strengths in music as well as film, representing Kanye West, Britney Spears, and The Killers, as well as M.I.A and Amy Winehouse. It also has several corporate clients, including Hasbro and MySpace.The new agency will be called William Morris Endeavor (WME) Entertainment and will be chaired by Jim Wiatt, the William Morris chairman. As well as film and music, the new company will represent clients in television, theatre, publishing, commercials, sport, marketing and below-the-line production.In an unusual move, WME will have three co-chief executives: Mr Emanuel, Patrick Whitesell and Dave Wirtschafter. WME has agreed a nine person board although it may find itself vulnerable in the next few months as it combines operations and looks for synergies.Talent representation is notoriously competitive in Hollywood and WME’s rivals will be watching closely, eager to pick off any stars that may be disgruntled at not receiving the attention they feel they deserve.Leading the pack is CAA, which has built a commanding position and a more diverse business than most of its rivals. The agency represents some of the biggest stars in Hollywood – including George Clooney and Steven Spielberg – but knows a combined William Morris-Endeavor will pose a different set of challenges.
103;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-04-20T20:46:03Z;Wall Street falls despite strong earnings;;Banks gave US stocks their worst day since the recent rally began in spite of better than expected results from Bank of America.The bank made strong earnings but the shares plunged 24.3 per cent to $8.02 as the company warned about “extremely difficult challenges”, especially from deteriorating credit quality.Other banks also struggled after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering converting loans made to big banks into common stock, thereby putting money into them without having to ask Congress.Investors were nervous about the idea, which some called “back-door nationalisation”, and Citigroup fell 19.5 per cent to $2.94 while Wells Fargo dropped 16.1 per cent to $17. Citigroup was also hampered by bearish analysis from Goldman Sachs, which said credit losses at the banking giant were growing at a “rapid rate”. Capital One, the credit card company, was one of the sector’s biggest fallers after Goldman Sachs cut the company from “buy” to “neutral”. Its shares lost 25 per cent to $13.38.A report in the FT that banks would be able to return bail-out money only if it was in the economic interest also hurt the sector.“Investors were disappointed that paying back Tarp (troubled asset relief programme) money looked further away, and then the news on deteriorating credit from BofA tipped them over the edge,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 4.3 per cent lower at 832.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 7,841.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.9 per cent to 1,608.21 points.But on the busiest day yet of the earnings season, a piece of acquisition news was the biggest surprise.Oracle, the software company, said it had offered $9.50 a share to buy its rival Sun Microsystems, which had been involved in take­over talks with IBM.Sun’s shares jumped 36.8 per cent to $9.15, while Oracle lost 1.3 per cent to $18.82.Shares of IBM fell as investors moved to anticipate the company’s results, due out after the close.The stock, which has risen more than 20 per cent since the market hit a low in March, dropped 0.8 per cent to $100.43.The takeover offer failed to spark a rally, even as several companies reported better first-quarter results than expected.Drug company Eli Lilly reported earnings that were better than both the same period last year and estimates for this period, but its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $32.99 as investors worried about weaker sales of its brand-name drugs.Halliburton, the energy conglomerate, also beat expectations, although with falling revenues and profits, and its stock gained 0.1 per cent to $18.79 after falling during the morning’s trade.PepsiCo was another company to fall in spite of reporting better results than anticipated. The company announced it was to offer about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers. This outweighed rising earnings, and its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $49.86. Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group rose 21.9 per cent to $30.73.Hasbro, the toymaker, was one of the few companies whose results did not beat expectations on Monday morning, with low consumer spending during the Christmas season hurting sales. The shares gave up 2.7 per cent to $27.16 after rallying on Friday following better profit margins than expected from its rival Mattel.Steel makers suffered after Bloomberg quoted a company official at Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel company, as saying it may halve the size of a planned plant in India and indefinitely defer a second facility amid low demand for cars and homes. As metals prices declined during the day, US Steel lost 11.3 per cent to $26.58 and AK Steel dropped 14.2 per cent to $10.25.Lennar, the homebuilder, was one of the heaviest fallers on the S&P after the company said it planned to sell up to $275m in common stock for possible use as working capital and to repay debt. Its shares lost 18.6 per cent to $7.60.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said: “The majority of the bad news is behind us, but we had a nice run up and a lot of people are now covering their positions.”
104;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-02-02T21:40:49Z;Wall Street downbeat on stimulus fears;;Industrial stocks were among the hardest hit on Wall Street on Monday as the market struggled to mount a recovery from its worst January on record.Investors took scant comfort from the latest reading of US manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management, which although better than expected was nevertheless glum.The industrial sector led the declines, down 2.5 per cent overall. Among the hardest hit big names, Boeingand 3M dropped 3.6 per cent to $40.80 and 5.9 per cent to $50.62, respectively.The major indices finished mixed after a choppy session in relatively thin trade. The S&P 500 drifted between positive and negative territory throughout the day, yet the benchmark index finished 0.1 per cent lower at 825.43 despite a wave of buying into the close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.8 per cent lower at 7,936.75, a fresh low for the year. Yet strength in the relatively cash-rich technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite stand 1.2 per cent higher at 1,494.43.“That’s more about short-covering than anything else,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman. “The earnings have lived down to expectations.”Semiconductor stocks did particularly well. Intel and Texas Instruments finished up 5.7 per cent at $13.63 and 5 per cent to $15.69 overall.Elsewhere, however, a succession of corporate results once again highlighted the damage that the recession – now more than a year old – had done to company performance.Consumer stocks did badly, hurt by a glum corporate outlooks from Mattel and Macy’s.An unexpected 46 per cent plunge in profit at Mattel, which sank 16.1 per cent to $11.90, hurt Hasbro, a peer, which lost 9.1 per cent to $21.93.Macy’s lost 4 per cent to $8.59 after the retailer cut its dividend from 13.5 cents to 5 cents a share and disclosed plans to cut about 7,000 jobs.Among other consumer stocks to perform poorly, Procter&Gamble shed 2.7 per cent to $53.05 after Barclays cut its price target to $58 and maintained its “equal weight” stance.Avon Products dipped 5.4 per cent to $19.34 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “buy” list ahead of its results.“The cost of doing business is likely to fall owing to pressure on commodities and advertising rates [but] Avon has limited exposure to these favourable trends,” wrote the analysts.The latest economic data came as concerns heightened that political wrangling would delay the economic stimulus package weighed on the wider market.Talks continued in Washington over the passage of the Obama administration’s near-$900bn stimulus plan, which is facing opposition from leading Republican senators who have called for further tax cuts along with other changes to the bill.Meanwhile, the financial sector – which outperformed the market last week as hopes mounted that the Obama administration would avoid outright nationalisation of key financial institutions and set up a so-called bad bank to take on their toxic assets – struggled for momentum.Investors were concerned that the White House had yet to disclose details of the plan and the sector was also hit by a Moody’s downgrade of the credit ratings on Barclays, the British bank.Among the big name banks, Bank of America shed 8.8 per cent to $6 even after S&P Equity Research, which previously forecast a full-year loss, adjusted its estimate to earnings of 47 cents a share.Regional banks also did particularly poorly, down 3.9 per cent overall.Also among the worst performing in the wider sector, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX tumbled 12.4 per cent to $19.28 and 6.2 per cent to $20.47, respectively, on a bearish view from Goldman Sachs.The financial sector overall spent much of the session in the red but stood 0.2 per cent higher by the close.Elsewhere, the energy sector came under pressure, down 0.9 per cent overall, as US crude prices slid.Healthcare and utilities – defensive areas – outperformed as investors sought safety.The market’s downbeat start to the month followed a 8.6 per cent drop in the S&P 500 in January, which was even worse than the 7.7 per cent fall in the benchmark index during January 1970.
105;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2009-01-19T20:04:47Z;A Guggenheim on the Tay;;"Most countries have places that are the butt of jokes, derided as hopelessly provincial. In England, Wigan arguably has that honour; in Germany it is Emden; the US has towns such as Peoria. In Scotland, it is Dundee – but its citizens have never shared the joke.A couple of years ago there was much Dundonian unhappiness when Hasbro, after research among the population of Aberdeen, proposed to replace the “Go to jail” square with “Go to Dundee” in the Aberdonian version of Monopoly. The plan was dropped, but not before wags added that “Get out of Dundee free” cards should be issued in view of the fact that, while entering Scotland’s fourth-largest city via the Tay Road Bridge was free, it cost 80p to get out (the toll has since been abolished).Dundonians find it tiresome when journalists point out that the city, with more than its share of brutalist tower blocks, was an effective stand-in for 1950s Moscow in the television film of Alan Bennett’s An Englishman Abroad (there, I have done it again).You can understand their frustration. Few cities have done more to improve themselves than Dundee. Since the return in 1985 of the Discovery, Captain Scott’s Antarctic vessel, to the city where it was built in 1900, Dundee has marketed itself pretty successfully as the City of Discovery. It can boast stylish bars, boutiques and galleries.Some things, alas, cannot be undone: Dundee’s medieval heritage, which once matched Edinburgh’s, was destroyed between the Victoria era and the 1960s. Remaining historic buildings have been preserved, however, and the city, although still suffering from deprivation, has diversified after job losses in the 1980s. While only journalism remains of the original “jute, jam and journalism” – through D.C. Thomson of Dandy and Beano fame – it has biomedical and computer games industries. Now Dundee hopes to acquire a branch of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. Supporters talk of a “Guggenheim on the Tay”, replicating the revitalising effect of Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim gallery on Bilbao in Spain. A feasibility study claims it could attract up to 130,000 extra tourists a year and create nearly 900 full-time jobs.Dundee is not the only place pinning hopes on the V&A. Blackpool, desperate for regeneration after its hoped-for supercasino fell through, is also talking to the V&A about a branch to house exhibitions of fashion, photography and jewellery. Whereas the Tate has offshoots in Liverpool and Cornwall, the V&A has yet to expand outside London.Past proposals, such as displaying its south Asian collection in Bradford, fell through because of funding problems. It will be welcome if this time the ideas come to fruition.In the gutterAfter last week’s item about Harold Pinter being advised to change his name to Harold Comedy, readers pointed out a similar – doubtless also apocryphal – story about Cooper Brothers, a predecessor of PwC. I consulted the FT’s dusty files.According to City folklore, when US accountants Lybrand, Ross Bros & Montgomery merged with Cooper Brothers in the 1950s, the Americans were unhappy about the fact that the firm lived in Gutter Lane – a somewhat downbeat address for the exciting, upmarket Coopers & Lybrand they were about to create. Being close to Cheapside did not help.So Cooper Brothers made a discreet approach to the City Corporation to propose a more suitable name, helpfully suggesting that Cooper Lane had a nice ring to it. The reply came back that, if they wanted to achieve harmony between street and accountants, they could always change the firm’s name to Gutter Brothers.Pinter ad nauseamThis time a story about Pinter that is true, I think. (I owe this to The Guardian’s Simon Hoggart.) Pinter wrote a poem about his hero, the cricketer Len Hutton, which read in its entirety: “I saw Hutton in his prime/ Another time, another time.” Having it sent to friends, he asked the playwright Simon Gray at a dinner party what he thought of it. Gray replied: “I don’t know, Harold. I’m afraid I haven’t finished it yet.”Who is responsible?Since the taxpayer seems to be bailing out all and sundry businesses, perhaps the concept of “corporate social responsibility” should be rephrased as “social corporate responsibility”.Send your comments to brian.groom@ft.com"
106;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.

This amounts to a shadow run on several banks.” Still, financials pared early losses as investors bought back into some of the stocks most heavily sold on Monday. By late-
afternoon the sector was down 3 per cent, having bounced off losses of as much as 5.7 per cent.Washington Mutual shares rallied 11.8 per cent to $3.61 after it said it was “well capitalised”. First Horizon, meanwhile, jumped 17 per cent to $5.89 after it reported second-quarter results largely in line with expectations and announced a new chief executive.State Street made ground, rising 7.1 per cent to $59.65 after posting big profit and revenue jumps in the second-quarter.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also pared losses, but only briefly, after Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency would limit short-sales in the shares of the two government-sponsored entities and brokerage firms.The pair slumped 27.3 per cent to $7.07 and 26 per cent to $5.26. Wachovia cut its losses to 7.7 per cent at $9.08 after a spokesperson said it was “fundamentally strong”.Broader markets trimmed losses as oil prices dropped more than $6. The moves helped consumer discretionary stocks to advance in spite of new data showing that retail sales barely budged in June despite the tailwind of massive government rebate stimulus.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3 per cent and led by the likes of Hasbro and General Motors which added 6 per cent to $37.05 and 4.9 per cent to $9.84 respectively. GM also said it would undertake a radical restructuring plan, boosting the stocks.Some deal news also lifted sentiment. Sprint Nextel shares surged 9.4 per cent to $9.04 after reports that South Korea’s SK Telecom was in talks to buy the wireless company.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,214.89 points – its lowest level since November 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,961.80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,215.71 points.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: ”It feels like the craziest day ever . . . The volatility index showed some real fear in the morning. But then oil sold off which calmed some people and brought buyers back into the market.”New data from the Labor Department showed that the cost of raw materials for producers continues to rise although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, moderated somewhat in June. Such costs are clearly taking their toll. Kimberly-Clark issued a profit warning blaming rising energy and distribution costs. The shares fell 6.5 per cent to $55.01.Eaton, the diversified engineering company, also declined 6.8 per cent to $74.47 after the company said 2008 profit would be lower than it previously projected because of rising oil prices. The industrials sector fell 1.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the biggest fallers, following oil prices lower. ExxonMobil dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.19, Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $89.42 ConocoPhillips slid 4.1 per cent to $84.82. The sector has now lost 2.9 per cent over the year to date.Healthcare was the leading gainer and the only sector to hold positive territory consistently, climbing 1.3 per cent thanks to some decent earnings news from Johnson & Johnson and Genentech. The pair rose 1.9 per cent to $67.70 and 5.1 per cent to $79.25 respectively."
109;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Scrabble vs Scrabulous;;It took a long time, but Hasbro, the owner of the rights to Scrabble in the US, has teamed up with Electronic Arts to finally launch an online version of the popular crossword game. The game is available at Pogo.com today, and is scheduled to make its debut on Facebook later this month. So what does this mean for Scrabulous, Scrabble’s ersatz competitior, which took Facebook world by storm when it launched last year?The prognosis isn’t good. Scrabulous has been under a cloud since January when Hasbro and Mattel, which owns the international rights to the game, sent letters to Facebook asking it to remove the game, citing copyright infringement.Meanwhile, an online version of Scrabble created by Mattel and Real Networks has been struggling to gain traction since it launched in April for audiences outside the US and Canada. To date, the game has managed to attract fewer than 6,000 daily users on Facebook – less than two per cent of Scrabulous’s daily audience of 450,000.Hasbro and EA may do better with the launch of Scrabble in the US and Canada. But even if the North American version attracts five times the interest of its international counterpart, it will barely make a dent in Scrabulous’s audience numbers.In January, Scrabulous’s creators claimed to be making more than $25,000 a week in advertising revenues. With the launch of a US version of online Scrabble imminent, the door is now open for Scrabble’s owners to go after their fair share of that revenue by pursuing legal action.Forcing Scrabulous to shut down would no doubt alienate tens of thousands of loyal Scrabulous fans. But with thousands of new users joining Facebook daily, it might make sense for Scrabble’s owners to risk some user backlash now in hopes of a bigger payoff later. Besides, if the game is addictive enough, even the most disgruntled former Scrabulous users may not be able to stay away for too long.
110;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Ford and General Motorswere also hard hit tumbling 4.8 per cent to $4.74 and 3.5 per cent to $11.13 respectively. The consumer discretionary sector gave up 0.4 per cent.Gains for oil producers however helped broader indices advance. Exxon Mobiland Conoco­Phillips added 1.1 per cent to $87.52 and 2.5 per cent to $94.13 respectively, while the sector climbed 1.6 per cent.The positive momentum was reinforced after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its measure of business activity in the Midwest improved in June, calming fears that output would collapse as the slowdown takes its toll.Industrials rallied 0.7 per cent on the news. UPS added 1.7 per cent to $61.38 and Cummins climbed 2.8 per cent to $66.16.Strength in the telecommunications and healthcare sectors, which added 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, helped offset further weakness in financials. The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,280 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,350.01. The Nasdaq Composite fell back 1 per cent to 2,292.98Last week, surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows.That pattern was repeated yesterday. The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering. The index is down 7.2 per cent over the quarter and 10 per cent so far this month – its worst June performance since the Great Depression.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts had warned that if the index broke through its March lows, it could retest its 2002 depths, but the recent bottom held. However, the index is still down 8.4 per cent over the month so far and 3 per cent over the quarter.One bright spot yesterday morning though was better-than-expected results from H&R Block. The US tax preparer reported its first quarterly profit in two years, thanks to the sale of its loan servicing unit. H&R rose 3.2 per cent to $21.49.Campbell Soup also cheered investors with news that it plans to buy back up to $1.2bn of stock by 2011. The shares climbed 5.2 per cent to $33.86.Analysts expect second quarter earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to decline 11.3 per cent – marking the first time that the index has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002. At the start of the year, analysts were forecasting growth of 4.7 per cent.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, says that, even with those revisions, full-year earnings predictions are too high as tighter credit conditions will have an impact on industrial activity.Telecoms were the leading gainers on the S&P 500. Sprint Nextel led the pack, adding 4.9 per cent to $9.35 after reports that its Instinct phone was proving popular. Verizon rose 2.5 per cent to $35.13, while AT&T gained 1.3 per cent to $33.19.The travails of the financial sector continued to weigh on sentiment. Bond insurer MBIA was among the biggest fallers, dropping 8.9 per cent to $3.80 after a report that it is selling municipal bonds to raise cash. Peer Ambac slumped 22.4 per cent to $1.25.Wachovia was the worst performing bank, dropping 4.9 per cent to $15.43 after analysts said it might cut its dividend.

Analysts had expected a decline of 60,000.The latest Institute for Supply Management report on the US service industry kept broader equity indices moving forward. The ISM non-manufacturing index showed faster expansion than had been forecast, boosting service sector stocks.But by mid-afternoon a rally in the financial sector had petered out however, after Moody’s placed Ambac, the embattled bond insurer, on review for possible downgrade.The S&P 500 banking index, gave up gains of as much as 1.1 per cent to close down 0.8 per cent.A speech by Ben Bernanke in Harvard, swung the broader markets into losses near the close, raising the spectre of higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates going forward.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up gains of as much as 0.8 per cent to close roughly flat at 1,377.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also swung from gains to losses, ending the day down 0.1 per cent at 12,389.99. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,503.14.On Tuesday, the travails of Lehman Brothers dragged down the banking sector and broader equity indices. A drop in oil prices also weighed on energy stocks.Financials have been the laggards by a wide margin for much of the year and the trend continued in the early part of the week, after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the credit ratings of a number of major institutions.Still, American Express helped lift the mood, if only briefly, saying it expects full-year profit to increase in spite of mounting credit losses. The credit card company rose 3 per cent to $45.64.Lehman climbed, for the first time in four days, adding 2.6 per cent to $31.40. An upgrade for Morgan Stanley from Wachovia helped the brokerage gain 1.7 per cent to $43.36.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill, which owns S&P, also made ground after reports that the credit rating agencies were near to a deal to end an investigation by the New York Attorney General into their role in the subprime crisis.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill rose 3.1 per cent to $39.63 and 6.5 per cent to $43.88 respectively.Ambac however, slumped 17 per cent to $2.49, while MBIA fell 15.8 per cent to $5.63, knocking sentiment and stock prices in the financial sector.Nonetheless, a further decline in oil prices offered some respite for consumer-related stocks hit hard by fears that record energy prices will curb household spending. Consumer staple and discretionary stocks rose 0.5 per cent each.Whole Foods Market was among the leading gainers in the consumer staples sector, rising 4.4 per cent to $29.34 after an analyst at FTN Midwest Securities recommended buying the stock.In the discretionary sector, Guess rallied 13.8 per cent to $43.11. The jeans retailer reported estimate-beating first-quarter profits and raised its full year earnings forecasts.Starbucks and Hasbro also made gains, advancing 2.1 per cent to $18.12 and 4.7 per cent to $38.80 respectively. Walt Disney rose 3.5 per cent to $34.35 on speculation that its ABC network will receive higher advertising rates than expected.Conversely, falling commodity prices weighed on energy and material stocks for a second day. The sectors lost 1.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.Sunoco slumped 9.1 per cent to $44.22 while Titanium Metals fell 4 per cent to $16.12.Technology was the only sector to find any significant positive momentum, driven by the ISM data.AMD rose 5.6 per cent to $7.19, Ebay gained 2.1 per cent to $29.89 and the sector as whole rose 1 per cent.
113;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Adverts cause concern in virtual Barbie world;;BarbieGirls.com is going VIP. The website associated with Mattel’s Barbie dolls – the world’s most popular toy – is this month to introduce a paid subscription section , offering users access to an improved version of its virtual playground.The site, launched just a year ago, allows users to create and dress their own online avatars, earning and using virtual “B Bucks” money. With more than 11m girls registered, BarbieGirls is about to turn into a new revenue source for Mattel. Chuck Scothon, head of Mattel’s girl brands, says the site is attracting girls in the eight-to-15 age group who may be outgrowing Barbie herself.“The online world …and the content that girls engage with [is] very much a new toy,” he says. “This online content is a great way to play fashion and beauty and hair play, but doing it in a fun and relevant way for an older girl.”The Barbie brand’s online makeover is one of the many signs of a developing boom in online worlds and social networking sites aimed at children as young as five, which spread to the toy industry three years ago.In 2005 Ganz, a Canadian company that makes soft toys and greetings cards, took the industry by storm with the launch of Webkinz, fluffy animal toys with codes to link to online versions. Webkinz users operate in a luridly coloured children’s version of Linden Lab’s much-discussed Second Life adult world, making virtual purchases of accessories with “Kinz Cash”, engaging in controlled chat with other participants and playing online games.Webkinz.com has been joined by Hasbro’s LittlestPetShop.com, Build-a-Bear Workshops’ Buildabearville.com and, this year, by Disney’s Clickables toys, which will be linked to its planned Pixiehollow.com virtual world.At the same time, US media companies are expanding their range of virtual worlds linked to their children’s television shows and online properties. MTV’s Nickelodeon announced plans last month to enhance its Nicktropolis site, built around its TV characters, and to create the “World of Neopia” for NeoPets.com, one of the most successful social and gaming sites targeting children aged eight to 17.Disney, whose sites attracted more than 27m users in March, has created a management group to focus on virtual worlds and online communities. Last year it bought the Club Penguin social networking and virtual world site (slogan: “Waddle around and meet new friends!”) for $350m (£176m, €225m).Virtual Worlds Management, which tracks the industry, estimates that there are more than 100 youth-focused virtual worlds either live or in development, with 59 of them aimed at children under seven. As the industry rushes ahead, child advocate groups are questioning whether parents and other authorities have fully grasped the explosion in online play for the very young.“Companies are targeting ever younger children and there is a bigger push to get even preschoolers online and engaged in social networking sites and virtual worlds,” says Susan Linn, of the Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. “While virtual worlds can be a creative endeavour for teenagers, there are real problems about their impact on younger children.”In the US and elsewhere, public discussion of virtual worlds has been dominated by potential threats to children from sexual predators and from violent images in online games. The media and toy companies have responded with an emphasis on site safety, with limits on what messages a user’s avatar can send.But Sara Grimes, a communications professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, says there has been very little attention paid to the commercialisation and marketing elements of digital play, including the collection of data that can be used for advertising linked to online behaviour. “It is easy to get distracted from these issues …The sites also play on that by promoting themselves as safe havens and tapping into parental concerns,” she says.Last December the CCFC launched a letter-writing campaign against Ganz after its Webkinz site – previously free of advertisements – started carrying ads for DreamWorks’ Bee Movie and Fox’s Alvin and the Chipmunks. The advertising included offering children’s avatars virtual clothing such as bee suits and the hoodies worn by Alvin and his chipmunk friends.Ganz now says it “recognises that some parents are against advertising, particularly those with very young children”, and “will very soon be adding the ability for parents to turn off ads from our promotional partners” – although not ads for its own products. It also says it will not allow the virtual products sold on its site to be branded by advertisers – a reference to the kind of immersive advertising techniques represented by the bee and chipmunk clothing.Immersive techniques bump up against voluntary industry guidelines that require online advertising on children’s sites to be clearly marked as such, although the industry’s monitoring body says it has seen no cases in which its online guidelines have been breached.Time Warner’s Cartoon Network children’s sites now launch with a general warning that the site has “pages and content that may include advertising”. Mattel’s Mr Scothon says BarbieGirl.com carries no third-party advertising. But the site has promoted its own products, with girls able to visit an online cinema where they are rewarded with B Bucks for watching Barbie DVD film trailers.As for similarly “immersive” third-party advertising, Mr Scothon says that “in the event we were ever to consider something like that – because the space is rapidly changing – we will make sure that any decisions we make are both validated and confirmed by both the parents and the children.”The BarbieGirls site is currently expanding a “just for parents” section focused largely on online safety – perhaps the most comprehensive effort by a company to make parents aware of the issues and give them more engagement in the content of the sites.But Ms Linn argues that there is a need for a broader discussion about the merits of virtual worlds, particularly for younger children, who are entering a world that is “almost completely predetermined”.She says: “The whole goal [on] most of these sites is to earn money in order to buy things for your avatar. I think we shouldn’t underestimate the degree to which children really absorb values from the toys we give them and the stories we tell them.”
114;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-04-21T20:39:49Z;BofA leads downward trend on Wall St;;US stocks slipped back in a subdued session of trading on Monday, narrowly breaking a four-day winning streak after Bank of America said profit plunged in the first quarter and investors received a mixed batch of earnings from other leading corporations.The second-largest US bank said profit dropped 77 per cent to $1.2bn, well below expectations, as more people missed credit card and home loan payments.Bank of America shares, which have lost about 25 per cent in the past year, fell 2.5 per cent to $37.61.For the most part, the equity market has remained stoical in the face of a series of poor earning reports from leading US financial institutions.Last week, Citigroup, the biggest US bank, said it lost $5.1bn in the first-quarter while JPMorgan, the third-largest bank, said earnings halved but financials still ended the week 5.2 per cent ahead.But on Monday, JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $45.23 and Citigroup lost 0.3 per cent to $25.03. An index of financial stocks gave up 1.7 per cent.The drive by financials to raise more capital looks set to continue this week.National City, Ohio’s biggest bank, on Monday confirmed that it would raise $7bn from a consortium led by Corsair Capital after it posted a first-quarter loss.The private equity group will buy shares at a significant discount to Friday’s closing price and the news, as well as a dividend cut, dragged the bank’s stock down 27.3 per cent to $6.06.Colonial BancGroup shares fell, dropping 10.2 per cent to $8.91, after it cut its dividend by half and revealed plans to sell 25m shares to raise capital.National City and Colonial BancGroup join financial institutions such as Citigroup and Wachovia that have been forced to shore up their balance sheets after subprime-related writedowns.The benchmark S&P 500 pared its losses in the late afternoon, but closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,388.17. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,408.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.2 per cent lower at 12,825.02.Amid the broad market sell-off, the energy and technology sectors continued their strong run of trading.Microsoft and Apple made ground ahead of results due later in the week. Apple shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $168.16 while Microsoft shares added 1.4 per cent to $30.42.Record high oil prices buoyed the energy sector. Hess was the leading gainer, adding 6.8 per cent to $112.41.Coal miners also found momentum after Arch Coal said first-quarter profit more than doubled. Arch shares added 6.5 per cent to $62.18. Its peers, Peabody and Consol Energy, climbed 3.4 per cent to $68.93 and 2.1 per cent to $88.10, respectively.Still, results from oil services companies Halliburton and Weatherford International left investors unimpressed.Halliburton said first-quarter net profit increased 5.8 per cent while Weatherford’s earnings fell but shares in both underperformed. Halliburton edged up 0.1 per cent to $47.46 while Weatherford shares fell 1.3 per cent to $84.41.Pharmaceuticals were in focus after two industry heavyweights reported first-quarter results. Eli Lilly said profit had more than doubled but it still missed analysts’ estimates because of a charge for dropping its inhaled insulin product. Lilly shares slipped 4.7 per cent to $49.60.Meanwhile, Merck said quarterly profit gained 94 per cent, boosted by a $2.2bn payment from AstraZeneca for a partnership on blood pressure drugs and a treatment for Crohn’s disease. Merck shares fell 0.3 per cent to $39.63.Quest Diagnostics was the leading gainer in the healthcare sector after it said net income jumped 32 per cent in the first quarter thanks to the acquisitions. Quest shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $49.12.Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel also reported first-quarter earnings on Monday.Hasbro said profits rose following strong sales of Transformers and Littlest Pet Shop products. Rival Mattel however, revealed its first loss in three years, blaming higher manufacturing costs in China and a slowdown in Barbie sales within the US.Mattel shares sagged 8.2 per cent to $19.99 while Hasbro gained 10 per cent to $34.68.This week, 155 S&P 500 companies and nine components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including American Express, McDonald’s and ConocoPhillips, report results.
115;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mattel to charge Barbie web fees;;Mattel, the biggest US toymaker, is hoping 11m online Barbie fans can help it offset a decline in the sales of real dolls.The group will be the first leading toy company to charge for access to a site that promotes its own toys, introducing subscription-based elements to its rapidly growing BarbieGirls.com “virtual world” website.Previously, toy company brands, such as Ganz’s Webkinz, Hasbro’s Littlest Pet Shop and Lego have focused on using their sites to drive sales of their physical toys.Bob Eckert, Mattel’s chief executive officer, told Wall Street analysts that the new “VIP” tier on the site will be “competitively priced” when it is launched in May, but declined to give further details.Mattel’s move to an online subscription service follows the success of media companies in developing revenue from digital virtual worlds aimed at a similar six to 14-year-old age group.Disney last year paid $700m for Club Penguin, a site where users who pay a $5.95 monthly subscription can dress up a personalised penguin and decorate its igloo.Viacom’s Nickelodeon also announced plans this month to expand its collection of online virtual worlds. This will include creating a new SpongeBob SquarePants virtual world and expanding its Neopets.com site, which it acquired in 2005 for $160m.Neopets uses a model similar to the adult Second Life, with revenues generated from both from advertising and from users spending real money to buy virtual cash to spend on the site.Mattel launched the BarbieGirls.com site a year ago. The site allows users to create and dress an online personality and to participate in online chats. It has more than 11m registered users.Meanwhile, the company’s leading brand continues to struggle. Mattel said sales of the dolls in the US fell 12 per cent during its first quarter, offsetting gains in international sales and contributing to a net loss of $46.6m, or 13 cents a share. Sales declined 2.2 per cent to $919m.Mattel cited a range of factors for results that disappointed Wall Street, including increased costs in China, due to labour and the appreciation of the Chinese currency, and higher materials testing and litigation costs. Its shares fell more than 8 per cent to $19.98 at lunchtime in New York.Shares in Hasbro, its smaller rival, jumped 9 per cent to $34.36, after it announced a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings to $37.5m, or 25 cents a share, on revenues of $704m. Hasbro cited strong sales of its Transformer action figures.
116;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-03-31T17:58:39Z;The wrongs and rights of naming rights;;No one upstaged Carla Bruni-Sarkozy during her visit to London last week, but Arsenal’s Emirates stadium did not do badly. Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown posed on the pitch and held a press conference at the north London football club – chosen because of its French manager and largely French-speaking dressing room.The occasion provided many free mentions for Emirates, the Dubai-owned airline, which paid more than £100m to give its name to the stadium. Given how smoothly the Emirates brand has slipped into sporting conversation, it is extraordinary that English football, so ruthlessly commercial in everything else, took so long to tumble to stadium naming rights.Some other English clubs have sold their stadium names to corporate sponsors – Bolton Wanderers play at the Reebok, Wigan Athletic at the JJB – but American sports teams have been doing it for far longer.The first sports naming rights deal was in 1971, when Schaefer Brewing paid the New England Patriots $150,000 to name their football stadium after the company, according to a paper by the US academics John Crompton and Dennis Howard. By 1997, a third of America’s leading sports stadiums were named after companies. It was 70 per cent by 2002.What is curious about the UK’s stadium slowness is that British football, cricket and rugby teams have been happily plastering their shirts with corporate logos for years, something regarded, equally curiously, as distasteful in US sport.Whatever the cultural differences, others are continuing what sport started. How, for example, would you feel about catching the train from Coca-Cola station or travelling to work on the Google line? It is already happening. The Dubai Metro, currently under construction, is calling for bids from companies to put their names to stations and lines.Naming rights are not new. The Washington Post suggested last year that they dated back to 1638 when John Harvard bequeathed money and books to New College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, to create “perhaps the most prestigious educational brand in the United States”.The mother country can beat that by almost 400 years. In 1260, John Balliol provided accommodation in Oxford to some poor students, which led to the foundation of Balliol College, Oxford in 1263. Or possibly later. The college engagingly admits “there is actually no evidence for such precision”, but 1263 is handy because it allows Balliol to claim it is older than Merton College, Oxford, founded by another naming rights pioneer, Walter de Merton, in 1264.Today, universities in many countries name themselves, their libraries and their professorial chairs after sponsors without a thought.Others are cashing in. The town of Halfway, Oregon, agreed to rename itself Half.com for the duration of 2000 in return for a donation from an internet company of that name.How far should naming rights go? In a free market, we should take a robust approach. How big a leap is it from plastering stations and trains with advertising to naming them after the companies? If the money produces a better service, does it matter what it is called?Many people will insist on drawing a line – at the school gate, for example. Too late. In the US, schools already offer companies naming rights over their facilities.Children’s hospitals would be a step too far, surely? No, the Mattel Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles and the Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, are both named after toy company benefactors.The Columbus Children’s Hospital in Ohio is now the Nationwide, after the insurance company that made a handsome donation. There were protests over the hospital’s naming of the Abercrombie & Fitch accident and emergency department, but that was because of the clothing retailer’s racy advertising.In the UK, companies are to be allowed to sponsor National Health Service activities such as “get-fit clubs” but not facilities. I am not sure, anyway, which company would want to associate itself with my local NHS emergency department – Hammer horror films, possibly.This is the problem with naming rights: one of the parties could end up regretting it. The Houston Astros had to get court approval to undo the 30-year agreement to call its stadium Enron Field.Do naming rights make a difference to sales? Boutros Boutros, Emirates’ senior vice-president, says naming rights, like all advertising, are not an exact science. Arsenal have an international following so people do talk about the stadium everywhere.It helps that it was newly built. Fans would never have called Highbury, Arsenal’s old home, anything else, just as the people of San Francisco ignored two successive corporate names for Candlestick Park stadium. They even voted for a proposition that it should never have a corporate name again. Some things are sacred.Send your comments to michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/skapinker
117;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-02-12T02:12:00Z;Hasbro’s China suppliers shift gears;;"Hasbro, the world’s second-largest toymaker, says its China-based suppliers are increasingly shifting production away from the coastal industrial regions as they face rising costs.David Hargreaves, chief financial officer, said the company expected a 14-15 per cent increase this year in the costs of made-in-China products, due to higher labour, commodity and currency costs, as well as the impact of additional product safety testing in the aftermath of last year’s US toy safety recalls.“Some of our vendors are moving further into China in order to obviate the higher labour costs,” he said.Al Verrecchia, chief executive officer, predicted that suppliers would respond to the rising prices by gradually extending their own supply chains to factories based around inland cities and away from the coast.“I think you are liable to see more people moving inland into China, and…probably over a longer period of time, you’ll see some sub-assemblies, some painting operations moving inland, and then final assembly continuing to be done at existing factories,” he said.Expanding production to inland regions, which often lack infrastucture for modern manufacturing, presents significant challenges for suppliers.But Mr Verrechia said inland China still seemed more attractive than shifting production to neighbouring Vietnam, which was limited by its smaller size, language issues and a lack of support services and infrastructure.“You start to develop new vendors in places like Vietnam, you’ve got to start all over again with issues of quality and safety and product reliability,” he said.Hasbro says it currently sources “the substantial majority” of its toys from China.The company yesterday reported that its fourth-
quarter earnings rose 23 per cent to $133.7m, beating Wall Street’s expectations, with support from strong sales of its toys linked to last summer’s Transformers live action film. Revenues increased 16 per cent to $1.3bnMr Verrechia, 64, will step down in May after five years as CEO."
118;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-01-17T19:07:00Z;Scrabble squabble;;At first sight it is a battle between the quixotic (26 points) and the quartzy (28 points). On one side are two young entrepreneurs who have provided pleasure and time-wasting potential to millions through Scrabulous, an online word game that can be played on Facebook: on the other, are two corporate giants – Hasbro and Mattel which own the intellectual property rights to Scrabble – demanding the application be taken down.The reality is more complex. The two brothers, Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, who launched Scrabulous in July 2006 are making more than $25,000 a month from their move. The owners of Scrabble are getting tough not with a couple of hobbyists but with people who are running a business.The breakthrough for Scrabulous came when it appeared on the social networking site. Now it claims more than 600,000 daily users, making it one of Facebook’s most popular applications.Enthusiasts have already set up “Save Scrabulous” groups. Some of them argue that Scrabble benefits from the interest that the online game has attracted with new sales of the board game, and warn that they will boycott Hasbro and Mattel products if Scrabulous disappears.These arguments miss the central point. Against whatever extra sales the online game may generate, must be set the damage it has already done to any licensed version that comes along. The presence of the unofficial game means that an authorised game will lack novelty. The ability to charge for it, once players have become used to joining in for free, is also reduced, and the brand itself has been diluted. Serious glitches experienced on Scrabulous could make players less willing to try an official online Scrabble game.There is also the fact that Electronic Arts has a licensing agreement for electronic versions of Hasbro games until 2013. Any settlement between the Scrabulous entrepreneurs and Hasbro and Mattel, must surely take account of the cost to EA as well.The quarrel over Scrabulous is a classic example of the challenges in maintaining intellectual property rights in a world where so much content is freely available on the internet. It requires nimble footwork to defend the product without sounding like a killjoy. The music industry is still wrestling with this.Even where unofficial usage represents a sincere tribute, owners of powerful brands must protect their intellectual property rights.

a month from their widely downloaded application, face a legal challenge from the two toy companies that own the rights to the board game.Hasbro owns the intellectual property rights to Scrabble in the US and Canada, while JW Spear & Sons, a UK-based subsidiary of Mattel, holds them in the rest of the world.Launched in July 2006 by Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, brothers in their 20s from Calcutta, Scrabulous has become one of the most popular games played by Facebook members and boasts nearly 600,000 daily active users.While there are many similar online word games, including Literati, they arguably borrow less obviously from the Scrabble name and format than Scrabulous, a factor that may be important in determining the extent of any copyright infringement.Comments written on a blog on the Scrabulous website give a hint of how it may be eating into revenues that would otherwise have gone to the companies that own the Scrabble brand.“I have been having a lot of fun playing and chatting,” wrote Cat, a user. “I was going to purchase the dvd scrabble but now i decided not. This is much more fun playing.”Mattel UK said: “Letters have been sent to Facebook in the US regarding the Scrabulous application …Mattel values its intellectual property and actively protects its brands and trademarks.”Rajat Agarwalla told the Financial Times that he “could not comment on legal affairs right now”.He confirmed that the group made “over $25,000 a month”, principally from selling advertising space on the application.A disclaimer on the Scrabulous website says: “Scrabulous is not a part, subsidiary, or venture of Hasbro or Mattel, and is not connected to them in any way whatsoever.“We hope this will encourage people to purchase the official board game and make sure that Scrabulous remains something that our children still come into contact with despite these days of electronic games culture.”The brothers originally launched their online game as Bingobinge in August 2005, but renamed it Scrabulous the following July.The game became a hit only after it was put up on Facebook in June 2007."
120;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2008-01-11T02:39:33Z;Hasbro chairman calls for global toy rules;;The chairman of one of the world’s largest toy companies has urged regulators to adopt common global safety standards as the toy industry seeks to recover from recent product safety scares.The US, EU and other jurisdictions enforce unique safety regimes that can force toy companies and their suppliers, most of whom are based in China, to adopt different testing and even manufacturing procedures for each destination market. Standards can vary between states within the US.“Why can’t we have one mandatory global safety standard for toys?” Alan Hassenfeld, chairman of the US-based Hasbro toy company, said on Thursday in an interview with the Financial Times. “If we had one standard for the entire world everyone would cheer because we’re so confused [by the competing standards] and it’s a huge cost.”Mr Hassenfeld was speaking on the closing day of the Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair, the first of three events that will test the industry’s ability to weather last year’s product safety scandals.Hasbro was not involved in any of the high-profile recalls, which centred on China-based suppliers and further strained the country’s delicate trading relationships with the US and EU. The recalls, which occurred last summer, stemmed from Chinese subcontractors’ use of hazardous substances such as lead paint and from flaws in companies’ own product designs.Mr Hassenfeld, who is also leading an effort to implement uniform labour and workplace safety standards through the International Council of Toy Industries’ CARE initiative, said companies could not evade responsibility for product recalls, especially those related to design problems. “A country doesn’t make a toy, a company does,” he said.The scandals have not, however, appeared to slow China-based toy manufacturers, which account for more than 70 per cent of global production. According to customs data, China exported more than $7.8bn (€5.3bn, £3.9bn) in toys in the first 11 months of last year, up from just under $7.1bn in all of 2006.“Most of the toy industry had supply chains that survived the storm,” Mr Hassenfeld said. But publicity over the recalls had also prompted change in the industry. “There has been a huge increase in testing and awareness,” he said.Jeffrey Lam, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council’s toys advisory committee, expressed support for a unified global standard, saying it would help reduce manufacturers’ rising costs in China and retail prices abroad.But most industry executives are not optimistic about the near-term prospects for a global regime. “Each regulator has its own set of rules – it’s not going to happen within the next few years,” said Gary Wong, sales executive at Trystart, a Hong Kong-based company that sells plastic beach toys.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong and Justine Lau
121;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-12-23T17:43:38Z;Japan’s toymakers up their game;;Japan may be a Buddhist country, but for toymakers Christmas is king. The country’s children are as familiar with Santa Claus as their western peers and – alas for Japanese parents – demand as much from his gift run.But Japan’s big toymakers are not entirely full of festive cheer. Bandai – which ranks number-three in the world behind Mattel and Hasbro – and its rival Tomy have their own problems. With the vast majority of their toys made in China, safety concerns are high.The good news is that Japanese producers have so far avoided large-scale recalls that hurt the likes of Mattel.Bandai last month recalled 3,300 Chinese-made stuffed toys after their painted parts were found to contain high concentrations of lead. But that pales beside the millions of Polly Pockets and Aqua Dots consigned to industrial rubbish bins.Bandai and Tomy credit Japanese safety standards, which require third-party inspectors.Yet, they have been rattled by recent recallls. Bandai has doubled its staff of factory auditors in China to 200 and Tomy will move more production to neighbouring countries such as Vietnam. In three years, it aims to make no more than 70 per cent of its toys in China, says Keita Satoh, head of marketing.Of greater long-term concern is the decline of the home market.A low birth rate means there are fewer children pining for Power Rangers, while the spread of video games has eroded demand. “It gets tougher every year,” Mr Satoh says.Yusuke Fukuda, a director at Bandai, estimates that the market is shrinking by 5 per cent annually, though he adds that Bandai – which bought the video game maker Namco in 2005 – is targeting 10 per cent sales growth in its toy business.Bandai and Tomy see several ways to increase sales. One is to pitch more to grown-ups.Tomy says 20-30 per cent of its products are designed to appeal to adults as well – things such as miniature remote-controlled helicopters and sophisticated user-programmable robots.Toymakers are also expanding marketing tie-ins with video games, television, clothing and snacks. Bandai is using tie-ins to revive its egg-shaped Tamagotchi digital pets, a massive global hit a decade ago.The first animated Tamagotchi movie is now in Japanese theatres.They are also looking abroad. Foreign sales accounted for 30 per cent of Bandai’s Y186bn ($1.16bn) of toy revenues last year. Mr Fukuda expects that portion to grow, especially as China becomes more of a consumer market influenced by Japanese media. “China will be a huge market for us. They have a similar sensibility.”This year, Texas Pacific Group, the US private equity firm, bought a 14 per cent stake in Tomy in the hope that a more global sales strategy would lift revenues.In the past, Japanese producers all but abandoned overseas markets to foreign licensees. Hasbro made millions by cobbling together two robot toy lines from Takara, now part of the Tomy group, and rebranding them as Transformers.Today, Japanese toymakers are transforming into global merchandisers. Bandai America last year won the right to make toys based on Ben 10, a US animated series that is not aired in Japan.“We have a winning formula that can work anywhere,” Mr Fukuda says. It helps that Japan has emerged as an entertainment brand in its own right. “Made in Japan” is now a label to be flaunted rather than – as with the first Transformers a generation ago – disguised by foreign distributors.
122;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-12-23T17:23:21Z;Safety key issue in holiday season;;"Anxieties over US toy safety may have affected consumers buying habits during the holiday shopping season, but it is hard to identify the evidence on the website of Wal-Mart, the largest US toy retailer.In October, Wal-Mart identified 12 “hot” toys for the season; at the end of last week its website had sold out of nine of them, leaving only the latest TMX Elmo from Mattel’s Fisher Price, Spider-Man 3 action figures from Hasbro, and the pink – but not the blue – version of Fisher Price’s Kid Tough Digital Camera.However, the 12th item, The Aqua Dots Super Studio – distributed by Spin Master – was withdrawn in November, after it was found to contain a chemical that turned toxic when ingested.The US toy industry has responded with a blitz of information aimed at reassuring consumers – including a special toy safety website launched by the Toy Industry Association that argues the recalls are a sign the toy safety monitoring is working.Mattel, which took a $40m charge in November for the cost of recalls of more than a million toys over concerns about lead content and risks from small magnets, also published a list of “toy safety tips” on its website.Its smaller rival Hasbro, which has not been involved in any lead-related recalls, published a letter to parents from Al Verrecchia, its chief executive, stressing its safety record.Ed Schmults, chief executive of FAO Schwartz toyshops, said his stores started putting up signs indicating country of origin for toys made in the US and Europe. But that while customers had wanted to talk about the issues, their behaviour had not changed discernably.“To our surprise, we have seen no change in buying patterns,” he said.Toy industry critics have also kept up the pressure on the companies. In early December, the Ecology Center, an environmental health group, said tests of 1,200 leading toys had found that 17 per cent had lead above the federally approved limit of 600 parts per million.The group, which is also campaigning to ban PVC in children’s toys because of perceived risks from phthalates – a chemical found in soft PVC and vinyl paints – also launched a website, HealthToys.org, with results of its testing of specific toys.The Toy Industry Association accused the group of “misleading consumers about potential health hazards”, saying that “the mere presence of inaccessible substances in trace amounts does not mean a product is harmful”.While trying to reassure consumers, the industry has also been focused on lobbying over the legislative response in Congress, with separate bills introduced over the summer in both houses aimed at tightening up standards, and at stengthening the federal Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC).The House approved its version in mid-December, which proposes gradually reducing the federally allowed limit on lead in paint from 600 per million parts currently to 90 per million parts.The senate version is broadly similar, but gives the toy companies a year, rather than six months, to change lead content.Critics say the proposals are inadequate. Public Citizen, the consumer rights group founded by the seasoned campaigner Ralph Nader, says the CPSC should be able to inspect factories abroad, that border controls should be tightened, and that foreign manufacturers should submit to the jurisdiction of US courts.Sen Sherrod Brown, a left-leaning Democrat from Ohio, has proposed making exporting companies pay performance bonds against recall risks. “We need to ban lead in children’s products and we need better labelling,” he says.But the measures as passed have been broadly welcomed by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, although there is a push for the final act to allow manufacturers’ own labs to be certified to test.Meanwhile, the companies have yet to say how they’ve fared this Christmas in the aftermath of the recalls.In mid-November, Gregg Steinhaffel, president of Target, Wal-Mart’s discount rival, gave some indications that concerns were changing buying patterns.It is still unclear whether that translates into lesser sales of Mattel’s TMX Elmo and Hasbro’s Littlest Pet Shop.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles"
123;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Virtual worlds add new dimension to play;;American children will be rushing from the Christmas tree to the computer, eager to try out a new generation of cuddly toys whose imaginary lives extend to cyberspace.The dramatic success last year of a range of web-linked cuddly toys made by Ganz has this year inspired a range of offerings from competitors aimed at children as young as five and six.Ganz’s Webkinz site gives owners who type in their toy’s exclusive code number access to an online history of their particular pets – with names such as Cheeky Monkey and Love Frog.But they also then participate in a virtual world where they can earn “Kinzcash” to feed and look after their pet, combining a virtual experience akin to Linden Labs’ Second Life with the regular care-taking theme popularised by Bandai’s Tamagotchi egg toy more than a decade ago.MGA Entertainment, the maker of the hugely popular Bratz Dolls, launched its Rescue Pets rival in August, with Mutt and Golden Retriever models at $9.99, undercutting Webkinz’s $14.99 pricetag. Its Myepets.com site allows the owners to take their pets to the vet and to a pet spa, which they also pay for with virtual money.In September, Hasbro launched a version of its established Littlest Pet Shop line, but linked to a similar online world.Other conventional toys, including Lego figures and Mattel’s Hot Wheels, now come with code numbers that encourage children to access information and games on the manufacturer’s online sites.Most of the virtual pet sites also include simplified social networking elements, letting children send messages to friends or to contact others using pre-scripted messages.This year also saw Mattel, the largest toymaker, launch a social networking site for owners of Barbie dolls, called BarbieGirls. The site allows them to create and customise a virtual character with its own room and to shop in a virtual mall and engage in moderated online chat.Critics have raised concerns about the further commercialisation of play through these virtual company owned worlds that require children to keep logging on to keep their online pets from falling sick – although none actually drop dead.
124;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-12-21T19:39:32Z;Carrefour fined €27.4m over toy prices;;Christmas is only days away but France’s price-conscious parents may be wasting their time shopping around for bargains on brand name toys to stretch their budgets.The country’s competition watchdog on Thursday fined five toy suppliers and three retailers a hefty €37.5m (£27.1m, $53.8m) for colluding to stop price competition during the holiday periods of 2001-03.Carrefour, the hypermarket retailer that has promised to reimburse consumers “10 times the difference” if a product is found cheaper elsewhere, drew the heaviest fine of €27.4m, while Hasbro was hit with a €5.1m penalty and Lego must pay €1.6m. Carrefour on Thursday denied any wrongdoing and said the decision was “totally unjustified”. The retailer said it would appeal against the decision. Hasbro also denied any wrongdoing, saying it was “very disappointed” with the decision and planned to appeal. Lego could not be contacted.The competition council also gave a clear signal that it suspected price fixing between retailers and suppliers might be an industry wide practice, especially in the holiday period when 60 per cent of the €2.6bn in toy sales are made. It has for the first time asked France’s commercial courts to examine the evidence gathered in two years of investigation into 76 companies. Some 49,000 pages of documentation will be distributed to the courts, which could potentially impose far higher compensation payments if evidence of illegal commercial agreements is found.In effect, the council found that toy suppliers had agreed with retailers that their products would be sold at the same price in all outlets. In parallel, suppliers and retailers established a system of policing that would detect when products were sold at lower than agreed prices, leading to price revisions. The system was aided by France’s restrictive retail law – soon to be reformed – that bans selling below agreed list prices. In some cases the list price was artificially raised, the council said.Although the investigation relates to the three years to 2003, UFC-Que Choisir the consumer group that first drew attention to the practice, on Thursday suggested little had changed since.
125;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-12-01T00:34:18Z;Wisdom on Monopoly;;"Growing up with older brothers, my childhood was filled with games, most of which I lost. How I loved Subbuteo soccer, with its plastic men and green baize pitch, gazed at contemptuously by modern, computerised children as if it were a stone age relic.We had horse-racing games called Escalado and Totopoly, and a newspaper game called Scoop, which featured a cardboard telephone with a dial to elicit a response to your work: “Congratulations! The editor likes your story so much it has made the front page!’’ (Not much preparation for real life, then.)Outside, we had a ball-on-elastic contraption called Jokari and a one-man-tennis thing called the Comeback, which rarely came back because the ball generally wrapped itself round a post. All gone now, I presume, with one exception. Monopoly – as the name implies – gets ever stronger. In a roundabout way, it is a triumph for the FT and its preoccupations.Indeed, new editions come out all the time. Places as trivial as Manitowoc, Wisconsin, have had their own spin-offs. The Tottenham Hotspur FC version has just appeared – along with a revised London version with eight extra squares. (“David Cameron could get into Downing Street this Christmas,’’ said one report.)Hasbro, the manufacturer, has also been running internet polls to produce new national games. The place with the highest vote was supposed to inherit the premium dark blue position traditionally reserved for Mayfair in Britain and the Boardwalk in the US – except that the French poll had to be edited because the winner was the national-joke village of Montcuq, pronounced mon cul – my arse.All harmless gimmickry – but twaddle. You play the game you grew up with. Monopoly endures partly because it depends on the second-most powerful of all human drives: avarice. But you can add also the simple beauty of the board; the protean nature of the game – every household plays it differently; plus the blends of co-operation and competition, and of luck and skill. Like poker, backgammon and cribbage, it is a game of chance – but a maddening game of chance in which, over time, the skilful player does tend to get most of the luck.Any half-decent Trivial Pursuit player knows that Monopoly was invented during the Depression by Charles Darrow. But that’s only a fraction of the story. According to a new history* by Philip E. Orbanes, its roots lay in very anti-capitalist prototypes with names such as The Landlord’s Game. And Darrow – an out-of-work boiler engineer – played a decidedly equivocal role.He had the wit to design the colour-coding, and the nous to persuade Parker Brothers (Hasbro’s predecessors) to take it on, but it remains unclear to what extent he deliberately nicked other people’s ideas. Oh well, all’s fair in love, war and Monopoly, as we say round here.Orbanes confirms what my son grasped, aged 10: that the orange squares are the best value. But he adds some things that I hadn’t twigged. All the colours between jail and Go to Jail are extra-useful: escaping prisoners keep having to confront them. Also, the real sharpers build three houses on their sets then stop, both because it’s cost-effective and because it helps create an artificial housing shortage to frustrate the other players.As a former Parker Brothers executive, however, Orbanes may be too grand to realise the extent to which the world is actually improving on the official rules. But, hey, isn’t that what capitalism is meant to do? A lot of Monopoly schools play the pleasing variation whereby all the fines go in the middle to be cleaned up by the first person to land on Free Parking. This practice is officially incorporated into the rules of Junior Monopoly.Engel house rules also include a double payout for landing on Go; the abolition of pound notes as too fiddly (rents are rounded up or down); and a maximum of three houses per square. Purists might rightly frown on this one, but it increases the chances of actually finishing before everyone falls asleep, and decreases the damage when someone jogs the board and sends the houses flying.I staged a long campaign to make jail more arduous, successfully insisting that prisoners should not be allowed to collect rent, but failing to get the cost of escape raised from £50 to a more market-based figure. My views are in line with current harsh thinking on penal policy. In spite of everything, Monopoly obviously still betrays its leftie origins.engelintheft@aol.com* ‘Monopoly: The World’s Most Famous Game and How It Got That Way’ (Da Capo)Matthew Engel’s column returns in the New Year"
126;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-11-05T01:17:57Z;OFT finds jail better deterrent than fines;;Executive jail terms and director disqualification are more effective in deterring cartels than fines and other financial penalties levied against companies, research published by the competition watchdog claims on Monday.The Office of Fair Trading-commissioned survey of lawyers and executives says for every cartel targeted by watchdogs another 16 potential conspiracies are abandoned or radically changed by companies who think better of pressing ahead.The study is part of efforts to prove the OFT’s worth in an environment in which it is under increasing pressure to do more demonstrable good with less money.The research by Deloitte & Touche found 63 per cent of companies thought new laws allowing for criminal penalties against executives involved in price-fixing were “very important” in deterring cartels. Only 37 per cent thought the same about fines imposed on companies.Fiammetta Gordon, who oversaw the work for the OFT, said: “It seems to suggest that individual penalties have more of a deterrent effect than business sanctions.”The research, which drew on surveys of 202 companies and 234 competition lawyers, said 55 per cent of businesses thought director disqualification very important in deterring cartels, compared with just 31 per cent who thought the same about private damages lawsuits brought against companies by aggrieved rivals.The research appears to offer support for the tougher – although as yet unused – regime brought in by the 2002 Enterprise Act, which allows for executives involved in cartels to be jailed. The study also chimes with broader market and public concerns that big business and executives are too easily able to shrug off the impact of fines and other monetary penalties.The survey says each OFT enforcement action between 2000 and 2006 deterred 16 potential cartels and 29 possibly illegal commercial agreements.Cases that had a deterrent effect were the 2003 actions against a replica football cartel and a toys price-fixing conspiracy involving Argos, Littlewoods and Hasbro, the manufacturer.One complaint highlighted is that uncertainty about cartel law means businesses draw back from exchanging information or launching promotions requiring retailers to cut prices, even though this may benefit consumers. Also criticised is the effect of the OFT’s alleged failure to make clear what remedial action would help companies meet competition concerns raised by takeovers and mergers.In a separate paper the OFT estimates the direct and indirect benefits of its work to consumers may amount to more than £700m annually. That claim comes as the organisation faces a funding cut, together with a target to show measurable benefits of at least five times its £51m core annual budget.

Merck said second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent, sending the Dow component 6.8 per cent higher to $52.33 at the close of trading in New York.Schering-Plough more than doubled its quarterly profit, but the stock fell back 0.6 per cent to $31.30 despite rising earlier in the session.Halliburton, the oil services firm, reported a 19 per cent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its share price up 3.2 per cent to $37.74.The steep rise came after the spin-off of its engineering firm KBR earlier this year.The Houston-based company earned $1.53bn, or $1.62 a share, up from $591m, or 55 cents a share, in the same period last year.In deals news, the oil drilling sector grabbed the spotlight as Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agreed to merge. The companies have a combined market capitalisation of $48bn. Transocean was up 5.5 per cent at $115.96, while GlobalSantaFe had jumped 4.8 per cent to $78.33 by the close. If the transaction goes through, it would create the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger.Many are betting that the world’s supply of cheap crude oil is running out and energy companies will be reliant on new and more expensive methods to produce and transport energy.Hewlett-Packard agreed to acquire Opsware in a deal worth $1.6bn, according to a company statement.The move, one among several recent business technology buy-outs by HP, is intended to help automate the company’s data centre.HP shares fell 0.2 per cent to $48.43 while Opsware shares soared 36.19 per cent to $14.00.Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity house, said it would buy United Rentals for $6.6bn, including debt. The stock was up 1.9 per cent at $32.98.But analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that financial stocks, and specifically brokerage stocks, continued to trade poorly. “Even after generally positive earnings news, investors want nothing to do with the group,” they said.Toymaker Hasbro also bucked the buoyant mood. Second-quarter profit fell 82 per cent, as a charge of $36.5m linked to warrants purchased from Lucasfilm outweighed the effect of a licensing deal for Spider-Man 3 toys and sales of Transformer toys. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.80.Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,541.52 at the close in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.1 per cent firmer at 2,690.58The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,943.42.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.58 per cent, to 841.25.“We still have a very positive supply demand ratio with a lot of money on the sidelines that wants in at the moment,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The fact is that investors are in a ‘glass half full’ mood and are generally prepared to look beyond problems such as the subprime mortgage market debacle and wider geopolitical risks.”He added that most agreed that the market continued to display largely sound fundamentals, describing the prevailing mood as one of cautious optimism rather than of irrational exuberance.In other news, VeraSun Energy agreed to pay $725m for three ethanol plants with annual production capacity of 300 million gallons a year. Shares were 4.9 per cent higher at $14.4.Shares of Tellabs rose 3 per cent to $12.20 after media reports that the communications equipment company is entertaining a $7bn takeover offer from Nokia Siemens Networks.Shares in Netflix, which was scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Monday, tumbled 12 per cent to $17.27 after the video rental company cut prices over the weekend on two of its subscription plans by $1.American Express and Texas Instruments were due to report their latest earnings after the closing bell in New York on Monday.The latest quarterly earnings from McDonald’s, AT&T, UPS and Amazon are due on Tuesday.Boeing and Apple results are due later this week.
128;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2007-04-23T20:31:19Z;Wall St lower in light trading;;"Wall Street stocks were lower in light trade on Monday following a run-up to a number of psychologically significant benchmarks.The leading stock indices have made big gains over the past month, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within touching distance of the 13,000 mark and the S&P 500 index towards its record high of 1,527, set nearly seven years ago.With little news to lift the mood on Monday, the leading indices drifted in and out of positive territory, unable to break through either of the “magic numbers”.The Dow was weighed down by General Motors, which fell 3.2 per cent to $30.67 after vice chairman Bob Lutz said the “mortgage industry meltdown” had hit industry sales this month.The Dow closed 0.3 per cent lower at 12,919.4 and the S&P was down 0.2 per cent at 1,480.93. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.1 per cent per cent to 2,523.67.While the benchmarks are primarily symbolic, they provide an important technical test of the market’s resolve.In particular, if the S&P record is broken, it may provide a telling sign of wider shifts in the way assets are being allocated.The Dow’s reaching the 13,000 mark is more likely but also less consequential. Vastly less money is linked to the Dow than to the S&P.“Dow 13,000 is not necessarily the magic number for a reallocation of money from bonds into stocks,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.But Mr Kastner said “low interest rates and better-than-expected earnings are encouraging investors to switch out of bonds into stocks. Investors will chase returns”.For the year to date, the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index has risen
1.8 per cent, which trails a 4.4 per cent rise in the S&P.Solid earnings updates from many companies have been a fillip for the Dow in particular as expectations were heavily played down ahead of the first-quarter earnings season.Results have been announced by 16 of the 30 companies making up the Dow so far and 10 have beaten analysts’ forecasts.No Dow component companies reported earnings yesterday but six are due to do so this week.Anticipating better profit updates, analysts at Banc of America Securities raised their 12-month target on the S&P 500 from 1,465 to 1,550.“Earnings should continue to benefit from commodity prices that are higher than anticipated, as well as some signs that some companies near the end of the production pipeline are beginning to achieve some price increases of their own,” the bank said.The weak dollar has helped boost earnings and BofA said their current estimates could rise if the currency falls further in value.Georges Yared, chief investment strategist at Yared Investment Research, said the earnings outlook for the second quarter and the balance of the year looks healthy and can support further gains in stocks.“We are getting good guidance and the Dow can go well beyond 13,000.”In deal news, Bank of America slipped 1 per cent to $50.51 after it agreed to buy ABN Amro’s LaSalle unit for $21bn.The deal, which is contingent on Barclays buying ABN, will make BofA the largest bank in Chicago, one of the few regions where it did not have a big consumer banking presence.Shares in MedImmune rose 17.8 per cent to $56.57 after AstraZeneca agreed to buy the biotech group for $15.6bn, or $58 a share.Other biotech groups were given a boost by the deal with Biogen Idec up 4.8 per cent to $48.86. Pfizer fared less well, slipping 2.3 per cent to $26.35 after Prudential Equity cut its recommendation, citing weakness in the pipeline of new drugs.“While the stock may be at the bottom, it is unclear for us what will lift it from here short of something revolutionary,” said analyst Tim Anderson.Shares in Amazon slipped 1.3 per cent to $44.36 after Piper Jaffray & Co cut its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “under perform”. Analyst Aaron Kessler said the share price reflected anticipation of significant margin improvements that were unlikely to materialise.In earnings news, Hasbro jumped 7.7 per cent to $32.54 after the toy maker beat analysts’ profit forecasts on the back of the biggest rise in its sales for about eight years. Analysts were particularly impressed by a heroic jump in sales of action figures such as Captain America, which are part of a five-year licensing deal Hasbro struck with Marvel last year."

Japan’s toy manufacturers are also still highly fragmented, making the sector seem ripe for consolidation.Tomy is understood to be in talks to acquire a US-based educational boardgame manufacturer and is also examining two Japanese rivals, although people familiar with the situation declined to identify any of the possible targets. The company is Japan’s second biggest toymaker and sells Tomica die-cast cars and Teletubby dolls.TPG last month said it would buy a 14 per cent stake in the company, marking the first investment led by the private equity group in Japan following several high-profile deals elsewhere in Asia.Jun Tsusaka, the head of TPG in Japan, told the Financial Times that TPG wanted to increase Tomy’s overseas sales ratio to 50 per cent from 15 per cent, in order to compete with toy giants such as Mattel and Hasbro.“Tomy is making wonderful products that are quite innovative, but it does not have a global organisation,” said Mr Tsusaka. “The biggest opportunity will be China, which is growing at a pace of about 20 per cent a year. In Japan, we could find definite synergies [in acquiring another company] through distribution and lowering costs.”Mr Tsusaka and Akio Ishida, a former vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch’s investment banking unit who is now vice-chairman at TPG, have joined Tomy’s board as outside directors.The two men are spearheading a project committee that is examining all aspects of Tomy’s business lines, including purchasing, brand value and supply-chain management. Tomy’s business has seen its domestic market share steadily eroded by the popularity of video games. In the year to March 2006, Tomy posted a group net loss of Y9.71bn ($82.4m) and for this year has cut its annual net profit forecast to Y1.7bn from Y5bn, blaming weak demand for traditional toys.In order to trim costs and boost operating margins, TPG said, Tomy could bring down procurement costs by about 15 per cent. “Until now, in many cases, [Tomy has] relied on only one to two vendors for purchasing agreements,” said Mr Tsusaka.Mr Ishida said there was room for growth in educational toys and video-game related products, such as T-shirts and lunchboxes. Tomy is also considering launching internet sales. “We think that Tomy has the potential to become number-one in Japan.”

We’d like to see them actually join one of the better existing initiatives and actually implement their codes …What we don’t need is another platform to discuss codes or standards.”CIES’s board approved the new draft code in December. Mr McClay said details would be made public in a month or so.The initiative marks the first time that large general retailers, rather than brands such as Nike or manufacturers such as Mattel and Hasbro, have become involved in creating a common set of global supplier standards.Even without full support of independent “stakeholders”, the purchasing power of the participants will exert considerable influence over the field.“They are so huge that people are going to be drawn in,” said one labour rights activist.The involvement of Wal-Mart is the latest sign of the company’s drive to improve its reputation on social and environmental issues.

Further weakness in bonds also suggested asset allocation moves out of fixed income into stocks benefiting from stronger than forecast earnings to date.“Clearly earnings have been much better than what the street was expecting,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “The sheer pile of money that has been sitting on the sidelines is starting to jump into the market.”The Dow outstripped broader indices and closed up 114.54 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 12,116.91, a record close, after earlier hitting an all-time record of 12,125.16. The S&P 500 index closed up 8.24 points, or 0.6 per cent, higher at 1,377.36. The Nasdaq Composite was up 13.26 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 2,355.56.It was a tale of two car makers as Ford reported a loss of 62 cents a share for its third quarter. Ford shares closed 11 cents, or 1.4 per cent, lower at $7.90.In contrast, shares in GM surged to a 52-week high and lead the Dow higher. It closed up $1.85, or 5.5 per cent to $35.19 ahead of its earnings later this week. Thomson Financial’s survey of analysts expects GM will earn 49 cents a share during the third quarter, compared with a loss of $1.92 per share a year ago. The stock is up 81.2 per cent for the year.Shares in Wrigley surged $6.40, or 13.7 per cent, to $53.23 after the chewing gum maker announced that William Perez, former Nike chief executive, would be the first person from outside the Wrigley family to head the company, which is 114 years old. It reported earnings of 53 cents per share – analysts estimated 51 cents.Google continued rising after last week’s stellar earnings. Its shares settled up $21.11, or 4.6 per cent, at $480.78, above its previous record trading high of $475.11. Also extending recent earnings-inspired gains was Apple, whose shares closed up $1.51, or 1.9 per cent, at $81.46.Wal-Mart was up $1.91, or 3.9 per cent, to $51.28 after it said it would slow capital spending sharply during fiscal 2008. Shares in 3M closed up $1.62, or 2.1 per cent, to $80.09 after its good earnings last week.Hasbro reported earnings of 58 cents a share, above a forecast 50 cents, sending its shares up $2.03, or 8.7 per cent, at $25.33.Despite better than expected earnings, American Express was the worst Dow component, falling $1.39, or 2.4 per cent, to $56.65.Halliburton rose 48 cents or 1.7 per cent to $29.26 after earnings of 58 cents per share. The consensus forecast had been for 54 cents.
132;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Chinese producers ‘give inadequate risk data’;;China-based manufacturers generally provide inadequate information about environmental and social challenges facing their operations, exposing investors to unnecessary fall-out risks, according to a corporate governance watchdog.The Hong Kong-based Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia conducted a detailed review of the prospectuses of 24 manufacturing companies that listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year. In June the combined market capitalisation of the companies – 14 of which supply globally recognised brands – stood at $21.5bn.Noting that IPO prospectuses “are often the only means by which environmental, social and governance issues are publicly disclosed”, Asria found that, “while the environment in which these companies operate is rapidly changing, disclosure is generally at a standstill, both in terms of content and coverage”.With China established as the supply base of choice for US, European Union and Japanese retailers, which are mandating more stringent codes of conduct for their suppliers, Asria says concern over disclosure of such risks is not limited to environmentally and socially responsible investors. All investors are at risk when a company loses a big contract because its operations fail to meet environmental or labour standards mandated by its customers, new international standards or the Chinese government.“The penalty for non-compliance can and does result in the cancellation of contracts that suppliers can ill afford to lose,” Asria says. “This has inevitably created immense pressure for supply chain companies to comply with numerous standards imposed by different customers.”In one example, in July, McDonald’s, Walt Disney, Mattel and Hasbro were forced to investigate a toy supplier in Dongguan, a manufacturing centre in China’s southern Guangdong province, after allegedly sub-standard labour conditions at the factory sparked worker unrest.Less than 20 per cent of the companies surveyed disclosed potential risks stemming from the EU’s directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances.Similarly, 40-60 per cent of prospectuses failed to cite either potential labour shortages or inflationary wage pressures as risk factors – both a fact of life for all China-based manufacturers.
133;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2006-04-24T19:47:05Z;Stock options hit Hasbro bottom line;;Hasbro, the world’s second-largest toy maker, on Monday reported a 3 per cent rise in first-quarter revenues but the cost of stock options and foreign currency fluctuations weighed on the bottom line.The maker of Monopoly, GI Joe action figures and Star Wars toys said its loss widened to $4.9m, or 3 cents a share, from $4.1m, or 2 cents a share, a year ago. The loss included $4.1m, or 2 cents a share, in costs for stock options.Last year’s earnings did not include stock-based compensation expenses. If they had, the year-ago net loss would have been $7.2 million, or 4 cents a share.Revenues rose 3 per cent to $468.2m from $454.9m a year ago as strong demand for Transformers and board games offset falling sales of Star Wars merchandise.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected a loss of 1 cent a share, including stock-options expenses, on revenue of $430m.Hasbro said North American revenue, which includes the toys-and-games business in the US, Canada and Mexico, rose 7 per cent to $310.3m, driven by growth in board games and brands such as Playskool, Nerf and Transformers.The growth was partially offset by an anticipated decline in Star Wars merchandise. International revenue for the quarter fell 5 per cent to $145.5m. The revenue includes a negative foreign-exchange impact of about $10.4m. Excluding this, revenue rose 2 per cent. Strong sales of Monopoly, Littlest Pet Shop and Playskool was partly offset by a drop in Star Wars and trading-card games.Alfred Verrecchia, chief executive, warned the second quarter would be “challenging” compared with a year ago, when earnings were boosted by sales of Star Wars merchandise.Hasbro has the rights to Star Wars toys through 2018. The final movie in the series, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, was released last May.Separately, Hasbro on Monday announced it was updating its Monopoly board game to better reflect US landmarks. The board of the new “Monopoly: Here & Now” edition will be determined by an online poll in which voters can pick their favourite landmarks in 22 cities around the US.Hasbro has produced more than 200 different editions of the game but the most popular remains the classic “Number Nine” - so-named for the original product number - which is based on the streets of Atlantic City.
134;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2006-02-27T18:56:50Z;The audience that fires back its own ads;;"Podcaster Adam Curry had no qualms about telling his audience that he originally thought Hasbro’s dancing iDog robot was “lame”, even though Hasbro was paying him to promote the product.It wasn’t until his daughter said she thought it was cool that Mr Curry changed his mind about the iDog, which hooks up to an iPod and dances to the music.Not only did Mr Curry tell listeners to his Daily Source Code podcast about this change of heart, he invited them to make their own adverts for the iDog and another product he was promoting, Logitech’s MM50 iPod speakers.The team at the company he co-founded, The Podshow Network, have even persuaded an advertiser – Earthlink, a US internet service provider – to use adverts made by listeners.For just as Mr Curry promotes products on his show, often without the sanction or recompense of their manufacturers, so podcasts provide a different kind of venue in which companies can interact with customers.Podcasts are today’s high-water mark in the tide that is user-generated content. Mr Curry says that 75 per cent of his show is made up of other people’s creations.One of the adverts Mr Curry received suggested that an iDog was better than a real dog; another cast it as a pivotal factor in a marriage proposal.Sean Black, senior vice-president and managing director at Beyond Interactive, Hasbro’s online advertising agency, loved the fact that users were interacting with the brand. “I thought they were funny and the client thought they were a crack up,” he says. And the product sold so well that, as Mr Black says: “You couldn’t even find it in the store.”Earthlink is a sponsor of the Daily Source Code. It started advertising on podcasts last year. It was attracted by the fact that podcasts have a responsive and passionate audience, says Scott Cuppari, manager of media, messaging and planning. “[They] get a very loyal following and you don’t get that with television or print,” he says.But the company didn’t expect what happened next. As with other sponsors, its services were the subject of discussion between Mr Curry and listeners. Most was flattering but Earthlink’s audio advert – a traditional-sounding radio spot – attracted criticism and some listeners created alternative adverts.At first, the adverts didn’t go down well at Earthlink. But after Mr Curry and his colleagues at The Podshow Network relayed what listeners were saying, Earthlink absorbed their message. On Valentine’s Day, Mr Curry announced that Earthlink would stop using its own advert and run a contest for the best user-generated advert submitted to the Daily Source Code and other Podshow podcasts carrying its advertising.The parties involved are finalising details, but it is likely that the campaign will run for a month or two, that listeners will vote on their favourite adverts and Earthlink will pay the finalists for their efforts.Even if there is no financial reward there is social reward for listeners in sharing their creations with their peers and any exposure serves as free marketing for bloggers or podcasters.The interactivity of podcasts and the culture of the medium makes for lively customer feedback, even if advertisers have to rely at present on the feedback of show hosts and companies such as The Podshow Network to keep them abreast of what is happening, given the sheer number of shows.Blogs and Podcasts take word-of-mouth advertising, that most primal of marketing methods, into a new, more interactive dimension.In addition to being vocal, listeners are often “lead” users – advanced users who innovate upon the product themselves. That is why Nokia, the mobile phone company, held parties in San Francisco and New York in December to meet bloggers who had been following its new internet tablet, the Nokia 770. This product has taken Nokia in a novel direction, not just because it isn’t a phone but also because it is built around Linux, the open source operating system. Nokia hopes developers will write applications for the device that increase its appeal to users everywhere.Bloggers aren’t just vocal supporters who raise awareness, they are a link into the open-source, developer community. Their feedback has been absorbed by the Nokia 770 development team.Bill Plummer, vice-president of external affairs at Nokia USA, explains that there is a fit between the open source nature of this product and technology bloggers. But he emphasises that Nokia has always engaged users in the process of product development. This interaction with bloggers is an extension of that process."
135;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2006-02-21T18:52:56Z;A juggling act between control and growth;;"When Bob Fox, a juggler and former school teacher, first saw sport stacking on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1990 he recalls thinking: “This is upside-down juggling.” Then he forgot all about it. Fast forward 16 years. Mr Fox, 48, is now president of Speed Stacks, a company he founded in 1998 to make and promote products for sport stacking.Sport stacking is a popular pastime based on a simple concept: stack a dozen specially designed plastic cups into predetermined se­quen­ces to form pyramids and then unstack them as fast as possible. An electronic timer counts the seconds for the whole procedure. Mr Fox refers to it as “a track meet for the hands”.Speed Stacks is now set to enter a new phase of growth after Play Along, a division of Jakks Pacific, US toy company, bought the licence last year to market and distribute the Stack Pack in the US and internationally, a move that will extend the reach of the sport from schools and recreation centres to the aisles of the nation’s biggest retailers.That would not have happened had Mr Fox not made a fortuitous career move. The journey from teacher to entrepreneur began in 1995 when he switched from being in the classroom to teaching physical education and was reintroduced to sport stacking – then known as cup stacking – at a workshop.He remembered the segment he had seen on The Tonight Show, which featured children from the Oceanside Boys & Girls Club where the sport was invented in 1980. He thought it would be a great way to help children with their motor skill development and hand-and-eye co-ordination.Mr Fox introduced sport stacking to his students and offered an after-school programme in the hope of getting 25 to 50 children to sign up. Instead, he had 200.At the time Hasbro, the second largest US toy company, was making a set of stacking cups known as Kup Stax and Mr Fox collected as many sets as he could find. But the supply ran out when Hasbro discontinued production a few years ago.That is when the proverbial lightbulb went on. “In 1998 my wife and I decided sport stacking was such a neat thing that we needed to take it from an activity or game or toy and create a physical education tool and a sport out of it,” says Mr Fox. “The supply of Hasbro cups dried up and we decided ‘let’s create our own brand and a PE curriculum, and package it with a lesson plan for PE teachers’.”Using their savings of about $50,000, the Foxes started Speed Stacks, which sells the plastic stacking cups and StackMats – neoprene mats with electronic timers. Mr Fox also developed an instructional video and curriculum guide.The Foxes decided to market their product by demonstrating it to other PE teachers. They also enlisted their three children to help with the demonstrations. (They were once described as the “Von Trapp Family Stackers”.) Emily, the oldest, holds the world record sport stacking time of 7.43 seconds for the Cycle stack. The Foxes criss-crossed the US, travelling to state PE conventions, where they held workshops and handed out free products along with an instructional video and a set of lesson plans.“I knew this was all about developing confidence in PE teachers because they wouldn’t teach it if they didn’t feel as if they could, and of course they had never seen it before and we had to give them that confidence,” Mr Fox says.As is often the case with start-ups, the Foxes did a bit of everything and their house soon doubled as the office, warehouse and dis­tribution centre. After working at their full-time jobs during the day, they would head to the company that manufactured the cups, pack them into the boxes and take them home where they would put them into bags and then fulfil the orders.In the first year of operations Speed Stacks, which is based in Englewood in Colorado and has 22 employees, had sales of about $50,000. Last year, annual profit – which is being ploughed back into the company – was about $200,000 on sales of just over $4m. The company has expanded marketing operations into Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. Nearly 11,000 schools in the US have a Speed Stacks programme.“Our intent has never been just to sell a bunch of plastic cups,” says Mr Fox. “It is to have a positive impact on kids and sport stacking does that.” He believes sport stacking helps promote hand-and-eye co-ordination, ambidexterity, quickness and concentration – skills needed to excel in most sports.In 2000, after 17 years of teaching, Mr Fox decided to leave the school system and work full-time at Speed Stacks. The following year he created the World Cup Stacking Association as the governing body. Last year the name was changed to the World Sport Stacking Association, better to reflect the sports element involved.Over the years the sport steadily gained new players and even attracted international players to the annual World Sport Stacking Championships in Denver. But Mr Fox resisted requests from small Mom ‘n’ Pop shops to stock Speed Stacks’ products on their shelves. Instead, products were available only from the company’s website and through some schools.“We have never wanted this thing to be the next fad or craze that comes and goes. We are all about introducing sport stacking programmes into schools and recreation centres and camps and churches and things like that because then we know it will have a life and endure because PE teachers and youth directors come back to it year after year,” says Mr Fox.“It is like lots of sports.
A big part of it is kids coming together, competing together, playing together on a team as opposed to just buying this in a store and going home and doing it on your own.”Then, unexpectedly, an
e-mail from Jay Foreman, president of Play Along, arrived. Mr Foreman said he had heard a report on National Public Radio’s
All Things Considered on how sport stacking was becoming popular in schools.“We are all about relationships and we don’t blow people off. So we e-mailed Jay back,” he recalls. “We knew that we were getting above the radar and that if we didn’t take it to retail somebody else would in a different way. We felt we wanted to be the ones to do that and if we found the right folks to do it with, we would.”Signing the licensing deal, however, “was not an easy decision”, says Mr Fox. “Our message is ‘this not just a toy and an activity, it is a sport’, and when a toy company comes to you and says they want to promote it, you get a little defensive, especially if they are promoting plush toys. In getting to know them we were convinced that they knew how to market things and they were looking for something aside from plush toys.”Under the terms of the deal, Speed Stacks retains the school market while Play Along will handle US retailers and distributors and will also seek out international distributors. Mr Fox says the two companies have agreed to promote sport stacking together as a sport and an educational tool. The key to the relationship, he adds, is that the brand message stays the same.“Our vision is that this is a sport for kids all around the world and everybody is playing by the same rules.”BOB FOX’S ADVICE TO ENTREPRENEURS■ Believe in what you’re doing: “For me the motivation is not the money but the positive impact it may have on kids.”■ Presentation is key: “A big part of being a good teacher is having some skills at being able to get up in front of a group. So that has also contributed to the success of sharing this sport.”■ If you don’t have a business background, hire people who do: “I have not had a business class in my life. I have surrounded myself with people who knows things I don’t and they help me run the business.”■ Work hard at developing relationships with customers: “A big part of our success is that we have developed some great relationships with PE teachers, parents, kids and Play Along.”"

By Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble
Harvard Business School Press, £17.99Say what you like about Donald Rumsfeld, US defence ­secretary, but he has, perhaps unwittingly, provided a definitive summary of the challenges facing risk-taking, innovative ­companies.“As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”Precisely. But try telling that to shareholders when your latest new venture has crashed and you are likely to be met with blank looks.At the start of a new year businesses are urged to renew their efforts to be more innovative. But as Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble show in their book, the desire to innovate is only the first step in a long and arduous management journey, punctuated by unknown unknowns. Finding new ideas may not be the problem. Putting them into practice is.Govindarajan and Trimble, professors at the Tuck School of Business in Dartmouth, New Hampshire, have studied dozens of new ventures at Fortune 500 companies, including Corning, Hasbro, Unilever and Cisco, tracing the successes and failures. They have emerged after several years of research with a theory of strategic innovation and a 10-point checklist of steps to make innovation work.The essential lessons are these: businesses need to establish new ventures in a clear corporate context, borrow intelligently from the parent company, ignore any irrelevant legacy practices, learn constantly from new experiences and regularly adjust their plans and forecasts – all this while under the spotlight of an impatient yet cautious board.No wonder so many new businesses are abandoned. Parent companies launch businesses that are badly designed and fail to adapt to new circumstances, or that fall short of unrealistic ­forecasts.From the outset we need to distinguish between four types of innovation, the authors say.First is basic innovation, brought about by continuous improvement of processes. This can be put into effect very quickly. Then there is a process “revolution”, which takes longer. The third type of innovation involves actual products or services, an even more drawn-out process. The fourth type – the theme of this book – “strategic innovation”, the biggest experiment or bet, may take years to play out and its results can be the most ambiguous and difficult to evaluate.As the authors say: “We choose to focus on strategic innovation because the long-term survival of a company depends on it more than ever before, and because it is perhaps the most devilishly difficult.”The three main pillars of the authors’ approach – their prescription for strategic innovation – are forgetting, borrowing and learning. The new business has to recast its strategy and forget inherited orthodoxies. Its new business model may require different competencies from its leaders. And it must resist the temptation to exploit existing customers, and instead explore new sources of demand.New “organisational DNA” – staff, structures, systems and culture – is required. Copying the parent will not work. A new venture is typically a more creative, flatter organisation with a stronger appetite for risk, the authors say. Pay is tied more closely to performance.Crucially, the new business has to learn. “One learning curve matters more than any other for NewCo: improvement in predictions of its business performance,” the authors say.This is where so many go wrong. As one Corning manager said, describing the heady days of the late 90s technology boom: “It seemed as though everything was growing at 70 per cent per year. So if you didn’t project $250m in five years, you heard: ‘guys, not enough zeroes’.”Having plucked figures out of the air as a target, managers regard these figures as holy writ. “Leaders must react differently to disparities between predictions and outcomes,” the authors say. Trends, not targets, matter most. “Falling short of plan should not immediately be viewed as failing.”Political tensions may arise, with enemies of the new venture disparaging its performance. For this reason Govindarajan and Trimble recommend that the head of “NewCo” should report to an “unconventionally high point within the corporation” – to an executive more senior than the managing director or chief operating officer of “CoreCo”.Innovate or die, we are often told. “Innovate and die” is the frequent outcome of badly planned and badly managed ventures. This book’s sensible suggestions offer innovators a better route map through the unknown unknowns of future competition."

Having traded lower for most of the day, the shares ended flat at $56.84.However, Apple jumped 6.3 per cent to $80.86, a fresh all-time high, after chief executive Steve Jobs told the MacWorld show in San Francisco that revenues would be way ahead of Wall Street expectations in the fourth-quarter.Hughes Supply jumped 18.3 per cent to $45.61 after Home Depot agreed a $3.5bn deal for the distributor of construction supplies. Home Depot rose 2.4 per cent to $41.80, making it the biggest Dow gainer.Toymaker Hasbro gained 6.8 per cent gain to $21.56 after the stock was upgraded by broker Piper Jaffray, while a hike in full-year earnings guidance sent shares in Phillips Van Heusen, owner of the Calvin Klein and Kenneth Cole fashion brands, 8.9 per cent higher to $36.41.
138;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2006-01-04T18:38:37Z;Responsibility allies heed antitrust traps;;"Companies that want to foster responsible business practices might be surprised to learn that they must also be careful not to breach the law.Certainly, when it comes to one recent trend – for companies in an industry to group together to address labour and environmental conditions – they must pay attention to how such collaborations might be viewed by antitrust regulators.Joint initiatives to tackle environmental and social risks are emerging in a widening range of industries, from tea and coffee to jewellery and clothing. In the electronics sector, for example, leading companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM are together launching an industry code of conduct for suppliers. Big brands such as Mattel and Hasbro have also said their suppliers must now meet jointly agreed standards set out by the International Council of Toy Industries.The idea is to pool valuable experience and to reduce the inefficiencies created when swarms of auditors are sent out by different companies to monitor conditions in the same factories.Many companies have also recognised that their ability to change suppliers’ practices is limited when acting alone.However, while the ultimate objective of industry-wide programmes is to improve conditions in the places from which companies source their goods, their collaborative nature means they and their advisers must pay attention to competition legislation.“Whenever companies get into a room to talk about their business, there is always an antitrust issue,” says Scott Greathead, chief executive of World Monitors, a consultancy that spearheaded the Fair Factories Clearinghouse, a joint industry effort to create a system for managing and sharing audit information.“The bigger the companies and the more market share they have, the bigger the antitrust issues,” he adds.Although the motivation behind these new industry collaborations has nothing to do with price fixing or market manipulation, technically there is the potential for the law to interpret otherwise, particularly as some of the sustainability programmes encourage the purchase of sustainably produced commodities.“Any collective purchasing by competitors is something you would need to look at,” says David Marks, partner in the competition team at CMS Cameron Mc-Kenna, a UK-based law firm.Corporate lawyers and other advisers also stress the need for alliances to establish themselves in such a way that prevents any market movements being interpreted as resulting from their collaborative activity.Supposing, for example, a group of competitors agrees on a code of conduct for their sector and, a day later, prices change for their products. Antitrust alarm bells might well start to ring, even though those price shifts were unrelated to the agreement.“Even if the participants in these ventures are pure as the driven snow and have every intention of behaving correctly, any time a group of competitors gets together for any reason, there is a danger their activities will be construed as being unlawful,” says Phillip Rudolph, vice-president and general counsel of the Ethical Leadership Group and an antitrust lawyer for more than 20 years.“That’s why these initiatives – which are important and are not in fact anti-
competitive – need to
be extremely carefully designed.”The Common Code for the Coffee Community, also known as the 4Cs, is one industry grouping that has looked carefully at its design. Through the 4Cs, coffee buyers have been working on a set of standards for the farmers whose crops they buy. Participants have also agreed to increase the amount of coffee they buy from sustainable sources.Annemieke Wijn, senior director of the commodity sustainability programmes at Kraft Foods, says that antitrust legislation has been closely scrutinised by Kraft and its partners in the 4Cs initiative. “We have been very careful from the beginning to have the competition authorities involved with this,” she says.To avoid the risk of being seen to be restricting the market, it is crucial for the initiative to be voluntary, Ms Wijn says. “We can draw up a code but we need to be sure it is entirely voluntary and that there are no agreements as to how much coffee might be bought according to this code.”She adds: “It is up to the individual companies to decide how much they want to buy, who they want to buy from and so on – so the voluntary part is a very important aspect of this.”Another key element of antitrust legislation is prevention of boycotts.This becomes relevant when groups of companies take a more hands-on approach to improving standards in their suppliers’ operations. The more closely programmes focus on remediation and, crucially, on decisions as to what to do when remediation fails, the greater the danger of breaching competition laws.The key is for companies to make decisions individually as to whether to continue to do business with suppliers that consistently breach their codes – and not as a group.As well as designing collaborative programmes carefully, companies can put another safeguard in place – confirmation of approval from the competition authorities themselves.In the US, this means securing a business review letter (BRL) from the justice department. After scrutinising the group’s objectives, it will declare that, on the basis of the information given, it does not intend to challenge the activities of the alliance concerned.“It is not a guarantee that they won’t,” says Mr Rudolph. “But I’m not aware of any circumstance in which a business review letter has been received from the justice department and [that group’s activities] have subsequently been challenged – so BRLs are very useful things.”Similar “comfort letters” can be sought from the UK’s Office of Fair Trading and the European Trade
Commission.For industry alliances that are trying to expand their membership, these letters and other forms of evidence that they have addressed competition issues also
provide reassurance to risk-averse potential members – particularly those in industries that have been subject to antitrust scrutiny in
the past.If competition issues have been addressed early on, however, antitrust legislation should not provide barriers to collaborative ventures in corporate responsibility, says Mr Rudolph.“These initiatives are all extremely pro-consumer and pro-efficiency,” he says. “They just need to be thorough in their approach to demonstrating that they are not creating competitive concerns and be aware of the traditional risks that are associated with competitors getting together.”INDUSTRY ALLIANCES: AVOIDING THE TRADITIONAL RISKS■ Market manipulation: corporate alliances must demonstrate that by their joint activities they are not engaging in price fixing or any other form of market limitation.■ Imposition of boycotts: codes of practice must be voluntary and decisions as to whether to continue doing business with suppliers that repeatedly breach codes must be made by individual companies.■ Proof of the benefits: alliances should demonstrate the low risk of anti- competitive harm arising from the collaboration and the pro-competitive benefits and efficiencies to be gained.■ “Comfort letters”: alliances can seek an official letter from bodies such as the US justice department, the UK Office of Fair Trading or the European Trade Commission. The document should state that the authority concerned does not intend to challenge the activities of the alliance seeking approval."

Earnings fell 12 per cent from the same period last year, to $225.3m, or 55 cents per share. Wall Street had been expecting earings or around 60 cents per share.Mr Eckert also said the company had again been hit by rising oil and component prices, and was planning price increases next year “to recover some of the costs we’ve experienced”.Barbie sales have fallen for the four years, partly as a result of competition from new, more edgy products, including MGA Entertainment’s Bratz dolls. Last week, Mattel announced the departure of Matthew Bousquette, the Mattel brands president in charge of Barbie, and combined the unit with its Fisher Price division.Hasbro, Mattel’s smaller rival, said strong sales of Star Wars toys linked to the release of the final Star Wars film The Revenge of the Sith, contributed to a 3.8 per cent increase in earnings to $92.1m, or $0.47 per diluted share. Overall sales inceased 4 per cent to $988.1m.Hasbro’s earnings were also below Wall Street’s expectations of 51 cents per share, but Alfred Verrecchia, Hasbro’s chief executive, said the company was pleased with its performance.But he expressed cauction over the outlook for the holiday period: “With the higher cost of gasoline and expected increases in home heating costs, it remains to be seen how much of an impact this will have on consumer spending during the holiday season”.
140;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Meg Whitman: ‘It has levelled the playing field’;;Meg Whitman left a job at toymaker Hasbro to become president and chief executive of eBay in 1998. The value of goods traded on the company’s sites has risen from $740m when she joined to $34bn last year.“I look back and say, ‘What were we thinking?’ We quit two jobs, moved to California, put the children in new schools. I didn’t think it was going to be anything like it turned out. I thought eBay could be a great collectibles website for the US. I thought this could be a small, quite profitable company.“We began to understand that what worked in collectibles would work in other markets as well. What eBay does is make inefficient markets efficient.“The business model is very powerful. We were able to move globally far faster than land-based companies can. The remarkable thing about eBay is that it’s instantly local: 98 per cent of our content is user-generated.“The other thing I wasn’t expecting was the way the market empowered small businesses. That was a big surprise. I thought this would be the home of big business. But it has levelled the playing field, and made small businesses as accessible as big ones. That was an ‘a-ha’ moment.“Some categories didn’t work the way we thought they would. We look for markets where there is price and information inefficiency. It turns out that real estate is pretty darn efficient.“I am startled by the ubiquity of the internet today. It is one of the fastest-growing technologies ever. It’s just remarkable. It has changed the way we communicate, the way we play. E-mail has changed the way business is conducted.“The timing may finally be right now for mobile access. We thought it was important to have mobile access to eBay and the net five years ago, but nobody used it. That could be changing because of the growing power of mobile phones. In countries like China and India, you may see a shift to primary access to the internet coming through mobile handsets. Moving to 100 per cent broadband penetration will also make a huge difference. You will see an always-on internet that changes the way people behave.“There is still room for new internet leaders to be created. Of the five biggest internet companies 10 years from now, I can imagine that two or three of the existing leaders will stay on, but that two will be companies that haven’t even been born yet. The internet is an incredibly dynamic environment. You have to respond really fast.”
141;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2005-07-18T11:42:50Z;Star Wars helps Hasbro profits rocket;;Star Wars gave a boost to Hasbro, the second biggest US toy maker, which announced a big rise in second-quarter profits on Monday.Turnover rose 11 per cent from $516m to $572m and profits leapt 50 per cent from $18.8m a year ago to $29.5m for the three months to June 26 leading to earnings per share of 13 cents - up from 6 cents previously and above analysts consensus forecast of 8 cents a share. Shares rose 2.5 per cent on Monday morning in New York trading.Alfred Verrecchia, chief executive, said: “Revenues were driven by significant Star Wars volume, as well as strong performance from a number of other Hasbro brands, including Nerf, Transformers, My Little Pony and Littlest Pet Shop.”Darth Vader masks and Luke Skywalker models helped the US toy division boost its sales from $167m to $209m and international sales from $179m to $210m.However the games divison, which makes Monopoly and is producing a new updated version to reflect the changes in the London property market, saw a slump in sales from $162m to $143m. The company said that swap-card games such as Duel Masters and Magic: The Gathering had lost their appeal. Operating profit in the games division more than halved to $13.4m.Meanwhile, rival Mattel reported a loss for the quarter following its decision to repatriate foreign earnings, and said 2005 continued to be a “challenging year”.The company behind Barbie and Fisher-Price said its decision to repatriate $2.4bn under the American Jobs Creation Act resulted in a one-off $112.9m tax charge.It added that although sales trends were positive during the quarter, its margins were under pressure.Overall, Mattel reported a $94m loss compared to a $23.5m profit the year before. Analysts had been expecting earnings of about 7 cents a share, according to Reuters.Sales rose 10 per cent to $886.8m thanks to the continued popularity of the Hot Wheels franshise and the Fisher-Price toys. Barbie products suffered a worldwide decline of 4 per cent during the quarter.Hasbro shares - up more than 10 per cent this year - were down 1 per cent in early New York trading on Monday.
142;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2005-06-15T08:08:28Z;Infogrames operating profits up sharply;;Infogrames Entertainment, the French video game producer that also controls Atari of the US, said on Wednesday a sharp improvement in operating profits had helped cut net losses for last year by 20 per cent to €25.3m ($30.5m).The company, which makes games such as Enter the Matrix, Sid Meier’s Pirates! and Dragon Ballz, said charges related to job cuts and the costs of servicing debts were still holding back profits.However, the company’s repurchase of €117m of convertible bonds in March, which it achieved after selling down its stake in Atari from 67 per cent late last year to about 52 per cent, would help cut costs and improve its financial position.The repurchase using cash, bonds and new shares helped cut debt from €313m to €189m.“With these solid assets and a stronger financial situation, the company is now ready to address the market challenges in the five years to come,” Infogrames said.The company reported net losses for the year March 31 of €25.3m, down from €31.5m in the previous year, and said that operating profits had jumped from €2.6m to €22.2m. It reported last month that sales for the year were down 14 per cent at €602.8m.Since the year end, the group has raised $65m through renegotiating its licences with Hasbro, the board-game and toy company. The agreement extends its rights over games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Monopoly and Scrabble, but it hands back Transformers, My Little Pony and Connect Four, among others.On Tuesday, Atari reported a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter net loss of $9.1m on the back of costs associated with the closure of studios in Massachusetts and California. For the full year, it saw a net profit of $5.7m, up from $766,000 last time.Shares in Atari closed down 3 per cent at $2.86 on Tuesday, while Infogrames’ were up 9 per cent at €1.45 in early trade on Wednesday.
143;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2005-03-31T18:12:42Z;Ready to fight over ‘Star Wars’ release;;New York's Times Square has seen its share of battles over the years, but nothing will beat Friday night’s meeting of the forces of good and evil: light-sabre-wielding Jedi knights, Darth Vader, his son Luke Skywalker and maybe even a wookiee or two are expected to pile into the crossroads of the world.Star Wars fans will be out in force this weekend as the new merchandise for Episode III: Revenge of the Sith goes on sale worldwide.In the US, Toys R Us, the largest speciality toy store, will open the doors of 316 stores, including its flagship in Times Square, at one minute past midnight. As will Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer and toy seller.Twenty-one international Toys R Us stores, including 11 in the UK, will also open after the strike of midnight to showcase the latest toys and games.Episode III - the final installment of George Lucas's space epic that started in 1977 - reveals how Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, goes over to the dark side to become the ultimate villain: Darth Vader.The original Star Wars, which broke box-office records, remains one of the top-grossing films. It also transformed the world of movie merchandising and licensing and spawned a vast collector base who clamour for Star Wars licensed memorabilia.“The advent of Star Wars in 1977 really marked the birth of the modern movie licensing and merchandising business,” says Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a trade publication for the licensing industry.When Mr Lucas made the original film, he struck a legendary deal with 20th Century Fox, the film's distributor, over ownership of the film's merchandising and sequel rights.The result is a multi-billion dollar business empire built around the Star Wars brand and a film industry where merchandise and licensing revenues can be as important as box-office sales.On top of ticket sales and merchandise, films generate millions of dollars from products such as videos and DVDs.As with the previous five episodes, the new line-up of Star Wars paraphernalia is generating as much buzz as the final prequel, which opens in theatres worldwide on May 19.Global sales of Star Wars licensed goods such as toys, video games, clothes and books have exceeded $9bn since the initial release nearly three decades ago, making it one of the most successful film-related licences.Howard Roffman, president of Lucasfilm's licensing arm, expects Episode III merchandise to generate worldwide sales somewhere between the $2bn made from Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 1999 and the $1.2bn from Episode II: Attack of the Clones in 2002.Toys are the biggest merchandising category and manufacturers and retailers, in particular key Star Wars partners Toys R Us and Hasbro, are banking on collectors and younger fans to revive slumping sales.“The movie properties are very important for the toy industry and drive a huge amount of sales,” says Anita Frazier, analyst at the NPD Group. “It is especially important for action figure and vehicle categories.”In 2002, when Episode II was released, Star Wars was in the top 10 for sales of toy brands, but dropped out in the two subsequent years underscoring the boost a film release can give to sales of licensed toys, Ms Frazier says.Hasbro, the toy maker behind the GI Joe action figure, holds the Star Wars master toy licence and has the biggest range of new toys.On Saturday the company will launch 56 Star Wars action figures, games and role-play toys. Wizards of the Coast, a Hasbro subsidiary, is releasing a new trading card game.“Star Wars is not only one of the most popular and successful entertainment properties of all time, it's also been one of the most successful toy lines of all time,” says Brian Goldner, president of Hasbro's US toys group.Lego, the Danish building block company, is another toy licensee. It is launching nine games based on Episode III.While the toy licensees stand to be big winners if the film is a hit, toy retailers also hope to ring up extra sales.“This is a very important movie across the toy and media businesses,” says John Barbour, president of the US division at Toys R Us. “Star Wars is going to drive people into stores, which is great for the toy industry. It is no question the biggest toy licence of the year.”One of the reasons behind its success, he says, is the collector base, which spans generations - from adults who saw the original trilogy when they were children to today's younger fans.Speciality toy retailers have in recent years been hurt by price wars with big discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target. But Toys R Us will be hoping this merchandising war is one battle it will not lose.
144;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;The toy makers come out to play;;February is a big month in toyland. It is the time when the world's toy makers, big and small, gather at the sprawling international toy fairs, first in Nuremberg, then New York, to show off their best creations.Beginning on Sunday, an estimated 20,000 buyers, mainly smaller speciality retailers, will pore over more than 5,000 new products as they hunt for this year's new, “gee-whiz” toys.The American International Toy Fair, first held in 1903, is one of the industry's most important showcases. This year, for example, MGA Entertainment, maker of the Bratz fashion dolls, is unveiling “Bratz Rock Angelz”, in which the dolls form a rock band.Rival Mattel, maker of Barbie, is introducing a new “American Idol” doll line based on the popular television show, as well as an animated Barbie movie called “My Scene Goes to Hollywood”.While some of the toys shown at Toy Fair will be in stores as early as late spring or summer, most will only appear on the shelves in time for the Christmas holiday season, the busiest shopping period of the year.Starting two years ago, the Toy Industry Association, which owns and manages the fair, split the event into two separate annual shows: one in October for mass-market buyers and another in February for smaller specialty retailers. For smaller buyers, next week's show will be their first opportunity to see this year's newest products. “For specialty retailers this is very, very critical,” said Thomas Conley, president of the TIA.All the big toy names - Mattel, Hasbro, MGA Entertainment, Bandai America and Lego - will be there. So will many small entrepreneurs.“A lot of great ideas are coming from the smaller toy manufacturers, who are really passionate about the products they are coming out with,” said Reyne Rice, a toy trends specialist and consultant.Toy makers have been noticeably less successful in recent years at producing blockbuster toys, such as “Furby” and “Tickle Me Elmo”, without which no Christmas used to be complete.The $20bn toy industry has also suffered from flat sales for several years amid fierce price wars, competition from computer and video game makers, and a phenomenon called “age compression” children growing up more quickly and losing interest in toys at an earlier age.According to The NPD Group, a market research firm, 2004 sales in the US were down 3 per cent following a flat year in 2003.Toy sales have declined for three straight years but there are signs the category has stabilised, with electronic learning and youth electronics toys showing double-digit increases last year, NPD said.In a research note, Anthony Gikas, analyst at PiperJaffray, said he expected toy makers to cross-market successful brands with other forms of media, including video games, music and movies.These days, the most successful new products incorporate electronics, music and fashion. The Bratz Rock Angelz, for example, will have an accompanying music album and video.Mr Gikas also expects more infant and pre-school products to be on display as these two areas have shown strong sales growth.Maria Weiskott, editor-in-chief of Playthings, a toy industry trade magazine, predicts there will be more “edutainment” - products where entertainment characters help children with their learning.As with previous shows, there will be lots of high-tech toys. Ms Rice said another big theme this year would be be “no more couch potatoes” a focus on toys to help combat child obesity and encourage kids to be more active, even when they are in front of a television or computer screen. To that end, Fisher-Price is launching the interactive “Star Station”.
145;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2004-12-26T18:48:32Z;Lex: Trouble in toyland;;Muggles making magic are rarely a gratifying sight. But this year toymakers? efforts to conjure up Christmas spirit have proved even less enchanting than usual. News that J.K. Rowling has finished her latest Harry Potter book provided one of the few pleasant surprises in toyland. The Quidditch World Cup video game by Electronic Arts, Mattel?s wand-waving action figures and Lego?s Shrieking Shack all depend on Harry.However, not even the prospect of another Potter book - as well as a film next year - seems to have boosted the spirits of traditional toymakers. Mattel, the world?s leading toy manufacturer, warns darkly of the unique challenges facing its industry. Like Hasbro, its main US rival, it cautioned investors in October. Last Wednesday, struggling German dollmaker Zapf issued another profit warning, blaming weak Christmas sales. Family-owned Lego, Europe?s largest player, has been drifting in and out of losses since the late 1990s. On Wall Street, toymakers have tended strongly to under-perform the market in December. That is not so this year, but mainly because toymakers have been trailing since late spring. Their story points at broader trends, which have transformed publishing, and could spell trouble for mobile phone operators - and hold a lesson for us all.Inspect a gadgetLike children, toymakers are born optimists and slowly had to be educated out of their heresy. Management errors are partly to blame for the sector?s woes, as the successes of some smaller players show. Lego, for example, took its eyes off its trademark bricks to chase fancier film spin-offs. Rising plastics prices, a key input, add to the gloom, while last year?s price wars and pressure from the likes of Wal-Mart have left specialised retailers wary of holding inventory. The fate of the leading retailer, Toys ?R? Us, remains uncertain. Even in the best of times, putting the right toys on the shelves for Christmas is a logistical nightmare, on a par with shipping another Harry Potter tome.All this has accentuated longer-term challenges. For most parents, Christmas remains a race to see which gives out first - your money or your feet. Although reliable data are hard to come by, the indications are that parental spending per child still rises faster than income almost everywhere. But demand for parental offerings is concentrated in the US, Europe and Japan, where children have become rarer. Moreover, an ever-larger chunk of pocket money and gift budgets is spent on fancy gadgets. In 2003, video games alone accounted for $26bn out of the $85bn global toy market. For toymakers, the biggest challenge is ?age-compression?: children getting older at a younger age. Sellers have to adjust to ever-smaller age groups. Mattel?s iconic Barbie doll, for example, faces a catfight with her funkier Bratz rivals over shrinking turf.To keep up with the girls, Barbie has expanded into video games, cosmetics and films. But she faces overwhelming odds. How can a middle-aged lady - Barbie is 45 - and her rivals compete with multi-channel TV, the internet and mobile phones? It sounds pretty hopeless - rather like the world of children?s publishing before a certain boy wizard came along.Bookish magicStrolling through a bookshop, it is hard to remember that crossover fiction barely registered a decade ago. Books such as Lian Hearn?s gripping Otori trilogy, set in a fantastically medieval Japan, would have sat firmly in the adult section. Age-compression looks as much of a threat to teenage fiction as it is to toys. But for publishers of books for children the benefits far outweighed the risks, although it took the Potter phenomenon for publishers to bet on it.J.K. Rowling was famously paid a meagre advance of ?2,500 for her first book. This autumn, by contrast, Michelle Paver?s magically realist stone-age tale Wolf Brother secured a record advance of ?2.8m. The market has clearly grown. Last week, news of the publication date for the next Potter boosted the share price of Bloomsbury, its UK publisher, by 10 per cent. Bloomsbury has used its windfall to diversify. More importantly, Rowling revived tongue-in-cheek child fiction for the benefit of parents. The results can be hilarious: witness Jonathan Stroud?s Bartimaeus books featuring a deliciously irreverent djinni. They are also encouraging for toymakers.If children behave more like young adults, their tastes can have broader appeal. Pensioners are probably the fastest growing group of enthusiasts for model railways. Similarly, video games have expanded their reach to people in their thirties. However, playful consumers of all ages value choice. Video games took off among older players only when Sony opened a platform for independent game developers. And consumers are becoming even quirkier. Who would have thought that there was much of a market for a device that allows you to carry your 10,000 favourite songs in your pocket - as the iPod does?Mobile operators planning to pick much of the content for third generation telephony should take note. Today?s youngsters - their most receptive audience - might be different in many ways, but they still do not like to be told what to do. This is where the benefit of diversity lies. A key ingredient in the recent transformation of children?s publishing was that someone was eventually willing to try out Potter. That suggests a broader lesson for toyland - and beyond.As in many other sectors, conventional wisdom in the toy industry has it that consolidation is inevitable. Even Mattel only has an 8 per cent market share in traditional toys. Most of the rest is supplied by family-owned businesses, often with little regard for short-term profitability. But with tastes becoming ever more fragmented, consolidation looks like an odd solution. Size is rarely the answer when part of the challenge is to generate new ideas. In a world dominated by sophisticated entertainment giants, it was, after all, tiny Bloomsbury that stumbled on a philosopher?s stone with the power to transform its sector.
146;HAS;Hasbro Inc;2004-10-18T20:42:01Z;Overview: Equities remain on the back foot;;With oil prices hitting record highs again on Monday, world equity markets were always going to find it hard to make much progress.Some disappointing third quarter earnings statements in the US added to the downbeat mood, helping push Wall Street towards its low for the year in morning trade. The top two US toymakers, Hasbro and Mattel, cited a “challenging“ retail environment and played down expectations for the Christmas trading period. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had staged a mild recovery, ending the session at 9,956.32. for a gain of 0.2 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3 per cent to 1,936.52.In Asian trade, the crude oil price reached a new peak of $55.33 a barrel over worries about heating oil inventories, which are well below levels normally seen at this time of year. But the move towards $60 a barrel eased later in the day, as speculators took profits. By the close in New York Nymex WTI was trading at $53.67, down $1.26 cents from its Friday close.“Markets are probably being too sanguine about the potential impact of higher oil prices on economic growth,“ said Peter Oppenheimer, head of portfolio strategy at Goldman Sachs in London. He said there is always a lag before the full impact of high oil prices takes effect, and the impact in the US has so far been muted by tax cuts.Goldman expects the oil price to average $47 a barrel next year, much higher than most other estimates.JP Morgan also warned that “persistently high oil prices are likely to extend the global soft patch in demand into early 2005.“ It cut its growth forecasts for the US, Japan and the eurozone in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, as well as raising its inflation forecast for the US for both quarters. But it expects US growth to pick up later next year as oil prices fall.Oil cast a shadow over European and Asian markets. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index eased 0.3 per cent to close at 992.06 after a day of listless trading. Tokyo fell for the seventh consecutive session, and other leading Asian markets, with the exception of Seoul, trended lower.The big corporate deal of the day was the $8.1bn bid by South African gold producer for Gold Fields in a move to create the world's leading gold producer.The bid had no impact on the gold price, which continues to suffer from profit-taking above the $420 an ounce mark. Bullion was 85 cents higher at $418.65 by midday in New York yesterday.Gold is often helped by dollar weakness and yesterday the US currency hit a new seven month low against the euro. But the big casualty of the day was sterling, which fell against other leading currencies after the gloomiest housing market data for nine years were published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
